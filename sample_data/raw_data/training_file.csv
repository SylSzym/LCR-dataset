5;29515563;The SCO4117 ECF Sigma Factor Pleiotropically Controls Secondary Metabolism and Morphogenesis in ;Extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors are a major type of bacterial signal-transducers whose biological functions remain poorly characterized in streptomycetes. In this work we studied SCO4117, a conserved ECF sigma factor from the ECF52 family overexpressed during substrate and aerial mycelium stages. The ECF52 sigma factors harbor, in addition to the ECF sigma factor domain, a zinc finger domain, a transmembrane region, a proline-rich C-terminal extension, and a carbohydrate-binding domain. This class of ECF sigma factors is exclusive to Actinobacteria. We demonstrate that  ;polyproline;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
9;10029314;Trypanosoma brucei poly(A) binding protein I cDNA cloning, expression, and binding to 5 untranslated region sequence elements.;Poly(A) binding protein I (PABPI) is a highly conserved eukaryotic protein that binds mRNA poly(A) tails and functions in the regulation of translational efficiency and mRNA stability. As a first step in our investigation of the role(s) of mRNA poly(A) tails in posttranscriptional gene regulation in Trypanosoma brucei, we have cloned the cDNA encoding PABPI from this organism. The cDNA predicts a protein homologous to PABPI from other organisms and displaying conserved features of these proteins, including four RNA binding domains that span the N-terminal two-thirds of the protein. Comparison of northern blot data with the cDNA sequence indicates an unusually long 3' untranslated region (UTR) of approximately three kilobases. The 5 UTR contains both A-rich and AU repeat regions, the former being a ubiquitous property of PABPI 5' UTRs. T. brucei PABPI, expressed as a glutathione-S-transferase fusion protein, bound to RNA comprised of its full length 5' UTR in UV cross-linking experiments. This suggests that PABPI may play an autoregulatory role in its own expression. Competition experiments indicate that the A-rich region, but not the AU repeats, are involved in this binding. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
12;19343174;The carboxy-terminal domain of Dictyostelium C-module-binding factor is an independent gene regulatory entity.;The C-module-binding factor (CbfA) is a multidomain protein that belongs to the family of jumonji-type (JmjC) transcription regulators. In the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, CbfA regulates gene expression during the unicellular growth phase and multicellular development. CbfA and a related D. discoideum CbfA-like protein, CbfB, share a paralogous domain arrangement that includes the JmjC domain, presumably a chromatin-remodeling activity, and two zinc finger-like (ZF) motifs. On the other hand, the CbfA and CbfB proteins have completely different carboxy-terminal domains, suggesting that the plasticity of such domains may have contributed to the adaptation of the CbfA-like transcription factors to the rapid genome evolution in the dictyostelid clade. To support this hypothesis we performed DNA microarray and real-time RT-PCR measurements and found that CbfA regulates at least 160 genes during the vegetative growth of D. discoideum cells. Functional annotation of these genes revealed that CbfA predominantly controls the expression of gene products involved in housekeeping functions, such as carbohydrate, purine nucleoside/nucleotide, and amino acid metabolism. The CbfA protein displays two different mechanisms of gene regulation. The expression of one set of CbfA-dependent genes requires at least the JmjC/ZF domain of the CbfA protein and thus may depend on chromatin modulation. Regulation of the larger group of genes, however, does not depend on the entire CbfA protein and requires only the carboxy-terminal domain of CbfA (CbfA-CTD). An AT-hook motif located in CbfA-CTD, which is known to mediate DNA binding to A+T-rich sequences in vitro, contributed to CbfA-CTD-dependent gene regulatory functions in vivo. ;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
18;11055941;Complete nucleotide sequence of ubiquitous plasmid pEA29 from Erwinia amylovora strain Ea88: gene organization and intraspecies variation.;"The complete sequence of plasmid pEA29 from Erwinia amylovora strain Ea88 consists of 28,185 bp with a 50.2% G+C content. As deletions and insertions were detected in other derivatives of pEA29, its size actually varied from 27.6 to 34.9 kb. Thirteen open reading frames that encoded predicted proteins with similarities to known proteins from other bacteria were identified along with two open reading frames related to hypothetical proteins found in GenBank and six open reading frames with no similarities to existing GenBank entries. Predicted products of open reading frames with similarity to the thiamine biosynthetic genes thiO, thiG, and thiF; a betT gene coding for choline transport; an msrA gene for the enzyme methionine sulfoxide reductase; a putative methyl-accepting chemotaxis gene; an aldehyde dehydrogenase gene; an hns DNA binding gene; a LysR-type transcriptional regulator; and parA and parB partitioning genes were identified. A putative iteron-containing theta-type origin of replication with an AT-rich region and a gene for a RepA protein was identified. PstI and KpnI restriction patterns for pEA29 isolated from tree fruit strains of E. amylovora were homogenous and different from those for pEA29 isolated from Rubus (raspberry) strains. All Rubus derivatives of pEA29 contained a point mutation that eliminated a PstI site and a 1,264-bp region that replaced 1, 890 bp of sequence found in pEA29 from strain Ea88. This change eliminated a second PstI site and increased the length of a KpnI fragment. An insertion sequence, ISEam1, was detected in one Rubus strain, and transposon Tn5393 was detected in three apple strains in two separate locations on the plasmid. Plasmid-cured strains exhibited reduced virulence and modified colony morphology on minimal medium without thiamine, indicating that some of the genes in pEA29 play a role in the physiology or metabolism of E. amylovora.

20;31837379;Characterization and immune function of the interferon-β promoter stimulator-1 in the barbel chub, Squaliobarbus curriculus.;To elucidate the immunity-protecting role of the interferon-β promoter stimulator-1 (ScIPS-1) in barbel chub Squaliobarbus curriculus, the full-length cDNA of ScIPS-1 was cloned and expression levels in response to stimulation were investigated. In addition, the function of ScIPS-1 and its domains were analyzed. The full-length cDNA of ScIPS-1 is 2524 bp and encodes 601 aa. The N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domain, central proline-rich domain, C-terminal transmembrane domain, C2HC-zinc finger, and Cwf21 domains were identified. The mRNA level of ScIPS-1 was the highest in the kidney, whereas the highest protein level was observed in the liver. The ScIPS-1 expressions were significantly up-regulated after lipopolysaccharide and poly I:C treatment. The ScIPS-1 protein level was up-regulated at 12 h in the head kidney and was up-regulated at 12 h and then down-regulated from 12 to 48 h in the liver after grass carp reovirus (GCRV) infection. The CiIFN and CiMx transcription levels were significantly enhanced in pEGFP-C1-IPS-1 and pcDNA3.1-ΔCwf21 overexpressing cells after GCRV infection. The results indicate that ScIPS-1 may function in the immune response against pathogens and provide a basis for achieving resistance to diseases in fish breeding.;polyproline;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function

22;9589752;Epidemiology of osteoporosis in women in southern Italy.;"Studies on the distribution of bone mineral density (BMD) values in different age groups and in different populations are valuable for understanding the causes of the appreciable geographical variability in fracture incidence. We studied a population of southern Italy in an area where the incidence of hip fracture had been previously estimated. With a completion rate of 85%, we recruited a group of 264 women between 45 and 79 years of age, representative of non-institutionalized and active women in the population, and measured bone density both at the lumbar spine (L1-L4) and at the right femoral neck using a dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) system. We report the age group distribution of BMD in this population. The elderly showed higher mineralization, as compared to an international pooled sample. The prevalence of osteoporosis among women of 50-79 years of age was 40%; the rate changed according to the measurement site. Our results show that a large proportion of women would not have been diagnosed as having osteoporosis if we had relied on a single measurement site. A very low percentage of cases (as low as 4% in the 50-59 years age group) was diagnosed at both sites. The lack of concordance in BMD estimate between measurement sites is significant at younger ages, with an almost dichotomous distribution of cases diagnosed either at the lumbar or femoral site, suggesting the hypothesis that distinct patterns of bone involvement and bone mass lowering exist and all eventually lead to systemic involvement. Longitudinal follow-up of this population should help address some of the questions raised by these results.";-;-;-;hard_0
23;8964504;Organization of the gene encoding transcriptional repressor deltaEF1 and cross-species conservation of its domains.;DeltaEF1 (delta-crystallin/E2-box factor 1) is a widely distributed repressor of transcription which binds at the E2-box sequence, CACCTG. It carries seven zinc fingers (Zf) in two clusters and a homeodomain in the middle as potential DNA-binding domains. We cloned the genomic gene encoding chicken deltaEF1 and analyzed its organization. The gene consisted of nine exons, the N-proximal Zf were encoded by exons 5 through 7, and the C-proximal Zf by exons 8 and 9. Exon 7 also coded for the large middle portion of the protein including the homeodomain. Promoter analysis and RNase-protection assay indicated that the gene is driven by a G+C-rich promoter without a TATA box, and the transcription start points (tsp) cluster around 20 bp from the start codon located in exon 1. cDNA and genomic sequences of the mouse delta EF1 were cloned and compared with the chicken sequence. The deduced amino acid (aa) sequence was highly conserved between the chicken and mouse deltaEF1, no only in DNA-binding motifs but also in other blocks (78% overall aa identity). More recently reported DNA-binding proteins, AREB6 (human) ZEB (human) and BZP (hamster), were attributed to homologues of deltaEF1, among which only AREB6 represented full-length sequence. It was also indicated that rodent deltaEF1 lacked exon 3. ;polycysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
27;25901823;Functionalization of cobalt porphyrin-phospholipid bilayers with his-tagged ligands and antigens.;Methods to attach polypeptides to lipid bilayers are often indirect and ineffective, and can represent a substantial bottleneck in the formation of functionalized lipid-based materials. Although the polyhistidine tag (his-tag) has been transformative in its simplicity and efficacy in binding to immobilized metals, the successful application of this approach has been challenging in physiological settings. Here we show that lipid bilayers containing porphyrin-phospholipid conjugates that are chelated with cobalt, but not with other metals, can effectively capture his-tagged proteins and peptides. The binding follows a Co(II) to Co(III) transition and occurs within the sheltered hydrophobic bilayer, resulting in an essentially irreversible attachment in serum or in a million fold excess of competing imidazole. Using this approach we anchored homing peptides into the bilayer of preformed and cargo-loaded liposomes to enable tumour targeting without disrupting the bilayer integrity. As a further demonstration, a synthetic protein fragment derived from the human immunodeficiency virus was bound to immunogenic liposomes for potent antibody generation for an otherwise non-antigenic peptide.  ;polyhistidine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

38;10575739;Antioxidant properties of albumin: effect on oxidative metabolism of human neutrophil granulocytes.;The present study aims at investigating the effect of bovine serum albumin (BSA) on the trial of oxidative-stress. The antioxidant effects of BSA were determined by human neutrophil granulocytes oxygen free radicals and their by-products (O2-, H2O2, HOCl) productions. BSA interacts with those reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a dose-dependent manner. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of BSA estimated, after phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) stimulation were: 33.5 mg/ml for O2-, 6.5 mg/ml for H2O2, and 6.85 mg/ml for HOCl. When neutrophils were washed after pre-incubation with BSA, there was no significant decrease of ROS after stimulation of PMA (maximal: 15 +/- 1.2%). In the free cell experiments, IC50 for H2O2 and HOCl were 7.86 mg/ml and 0.67 mg/ml, respectively. The mechanism at which BSA acts may result from a simple chemical interaction with ROS rather than an intracellular mechanism by intervention in PMA oxidative metabolism. These antioxidant activities confer to BSA properties, which might be used to prevent damage inflicted by these ROS during inflammatory disorders.;-;-;-;hard_0
44;8976106;[Hypertension and hyperuricemia].;Epidemiological studies show that serum uric acid is positively associated with blood pressure levels and that serum uric acid is also a predictor of the development of hypertension in normotensive adults. Several clinical studies revealed that insulin resistance and/or hyperinsulinaemia is associated with hypertension and higher plasma concentrations of uric acid, triglyceride and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 and with lower HDL cholesterol concentrations. Abnormalities in membrane transport system of sodium and related ions may be associated with impared urinary excretion of uric acid in hyperuricemic patients with hypertension. Several anti-hypertensive drugs have been shown to increase urinary excretion of uric acid and thereby reduce its serum level. Strict salt restriction and weight loss may cause at least in the short-term, adverse metabolic changes including elevated uric acid levels. In hypertensive patients.;-;-;-;hard_0

53;8392604;A mutation in the RNA polymerase of poliovirus type 1 contributes to attenuation in mice.;"The attenuated Sabin strain of poliovirus type 1 (PV-1) differs from the neurovirulent PV-1 Mahoney strain by 55 nucleotide mutations. Only one of these mutations (A-480-->G, in the 5' noncoding (5' NC) region of the genome, is well characterized, and it confers a strong attenuating effect. We attempted to identify genetic attenuation determinants in the 3'-terminal part of the Sabin 1 genome including the 3D polymerase (3Dpol) gene and the 3' NC region. Previous studies suggested that some of the 11 mutations in this region of the Sabin 1 genome, and in particular a mutation in the polymerase gene (U-6203-->C, Tyr-73-->His), are involved to some extent in the attenuation of PV-1. We analyzed the attenuating effect in the mouse model by using the mouse-adapted PV-1/PV-2 chimeric strain v510 (a Mahoney strain carrying nine amino acids of the VP1 capsid protein from the Lansing strain of PV-2). Mutagenesis of locus 6203 was performed on the original v510 (U-6203-->C) and also on a hybrid v510/Sabin 1 (C-6203-->U) carrying the downstream 1,840 nucleotides of the Sabin 1 genome including the 3Dpol and 3' NC regions. Statistical analysis of disease incidence and time to disease onset in numerous mice inoculated with these strains strongly suggested that nucleotide C-6203 is involved in the attenuation of the Sabin 1 strain. Results also suggested that, among the mutations located in the 3Dpol and 3' NC regions, nucleotide C-6203 may be the principal or the only one to be involved in attenuation in this mouse model. We also found that the effect of C-6203 was weaker than that of nucleotide G-480; the two nucleotides acted independently and may have a cumulative effect on attenuation. The U-6203-->C substitution also appeared to contribute to the thermosensitivity of the Sabin 1 strain.";-;-;-;hard_0
54;9230051;Molecular basis for the coupling ion selectivity of F1F0 ATP synthases: probing the liganding groups for Na+ and Li+ in the c subunit of the ATP synthase from Propionigenium modestum.;The conserved glutamate residue at position 65 of the Propionigenium modestum c subunit is directly involved in binding and translocation of Na+ across the membrane. The site-specific introduction of the cQ32I and cS66A substitutions in the putative vicinity to cE65 inhibited growth of the single-site mutants on succinate minimal agar, indicating that both amino acid residues are important for proper function of the oxidative phosphorylation system. This growth inhibition was abolished, however, if the cF84L/cL87V double mutation was additionally present in the P. modestum c subunit. The newly constructed Escherichia coli strain MPC848732I, harboring the cQ32I/cF84L/cL87V triple mutation, revealed a change in the coupling ion specificity from Na+ to H+. ATP hydrolysis by this enzyme was therefore not activated by NaCl, and ATP-driven H+ transport was not affected by this alkali salt. Both activities were influenced, however, by LiCl. These data demonstrate the loss of the Na+ binding site and retention of Li+ and H+ binding sites within this mutant ATPase. In the E. coli strain MPC848766A (cS66A/cF84L/cL87V), the specificity of the ATPase was further restricted to H+ as the exclusive coupling ion. Therefore, neither Na+ nor Li+ stimulated the ATPase activity, and no ATP-driven Li+ transport was observed. The ATPase of the E. coli mutant MPC32N (cQ32N) was activated by NaCl and LiCl. The mutant ATPase exhibited a 5-fold higher Km for NaCl but no change in the Km for LiCl in comparison to that of the parent strain. These results demonstrate that the binding of Na+ to the c subunit of P. modestum requires liganding groups provided by Q32, E65, and S66. For the coordination of Li+, two liganding partners, E65 and S66, are sufficient, and H+ translocation was mediated by E65 alone.;-;-;-;hard_0

57;18082158;Squid, Cup, and PABP55B function together to regulate gurken translation in Drosophila.;During Drosophila melanogaster oogenesis, the proper localization of gurken (grk) mRNA and protein is required for the establishment of the dorsal-ventral axis of the egg and future embryo. Squid (Sqd) is an RNA-binding protein that is required for the correct localization and translational regulation of the grk message. We show that Cup and polyA-binding protein (PABP) interact physically with Sqd and with each other in ovaries. We show that cup mutants lay dorsalized eggs, enhance dorsalization of weak sqd alleles, and display defects in grk mRNA localization and Grk protein accumulation. In contrast, pAbp mutants lay ventralized eggs and enhance grk haploinsufficiency. PABP also interacts genetically and biochemically with Encore. These data predict a model in which Cup and Sqd mediate translational repression of unlocalized grk mRNA, and PABP and Enc facilitate translational activation of the message once it is fully localized to the dorsal-anterior region of the oocyte. These data also provide the first evidence of a link between the complex of commonly used trans-acting factors and Enc, a factor that is required for grk translation. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

68;22328143;Effects of external electromagnetic fields on the conformational sampling of a short alanine peptide.;Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of a solvated 21-residue polyalanine (A21) peptide, featuring a high propensity for helix formation, have been performed at 300 K and 1 bar in the presence of external electromagnetic (e/m) fields in the microwave region (2.45 GHz) and an r.m.s. electric field intensity range of 0.01-0.05 V/Å. To investigate how the field presence affects transitions between the conformational states of a protein, we report 16 independent 40 ns-trajectories of A21 starting from both extended and fully folded states. We observe folding-behavior of the peptide consistent with prior simulation and experimental studies. The peptide displays a natural tendency to form stable elements of secondary structure which are stabilized by tertiary interactions with proximate regions of the peptide. Consistent with our earlier work, the presence of external e/m fields disrupts this behavior, involving a mechanism of localized dipolar alignment which serves to enhance intra-protein perturbations in hydrogen bonds (English, et al., J. Chem. Phys. 2010, 133, 091105), leading to more frequent transitions between shorter-lifetime states. ;polyalanine;helix;-;LCR_with_function

77;22329826;Mutations in AEC syndrome skin reveal a role for p63 in basement membrane adhesion, skin barrier integrity and hair follicle biology.;"AEC (ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-clefting) syndrome is an autosomal dominant ectodermal dysplasia disorder caused by mutations in the transcription factor p63. Clinically, the skin is dry and often fragile; other features can include partial eyelid fusion (ankyloblepharon), hypodontia, orofacial clefting, sparse hair or alopecia, and nail dystrophy. To investigate how p63 gene mutations affect gene and protein expression in AEC syndrome skin. We performed microarray analysis on samples of intact and eroded AEC syndrome skin compared with control skin. Changes were verified by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and, for basal keratinocyte-associated genes, by immunohistochemistry and analysis of microdissected skin. We identified significant upregulation of six genes and downregulation of 69 genes in AEC syndrome skin, with the main changes in genes implicated in epidermal adhesion, skin barrier formation and hair follicle biology. There was reduced expression of genes encoding the basement membrane proteins FRAS1 and collagen VII, as well as the skin barrier-associated small proline-rich proteins 1A and 4, late cornified envelope protein 5A, hornerin, and lipid transporters including ALOX15B. Reduced expression of the hair-associated keratins 25, 27, 31, 33B, 34, 35, 81 and 85 was also noted. We also confirmed similar alterations in gene expression for 26 of the 75 genes in eroded AEC scalp skin.

89;33277379;Sequestration of the PKC ortholog Pck2 in stress granules as a feedback mechanism of MAPK signaling in fission yeast.;Protein kinase C (PKC) signaling is a highly conserved signaling module that plays a central role in a myriad of physiological processes, ranging from cell proliferation to cell death, via various signaling pathways, including MAPK signaling. Stress granules (SGs) are non-membranous cytoplasmic foci that aggregate in cells exposed to environmental stresses. Here, we explored the role of SGs in PKC/MAPK signaling activation in fission yeast. High-heat stress (HHS) induced Pmk1 MAPK activation and Pck2 translocation from the cell tips into poly(A)-binding protein (Pabp)-positive SGs. Pck2 dispersal from the cell tips required Pck2 kinase activity, and constitutively active Pck2 exhibited increased translocation to SGs. Importantly, Pmk1 deletion impaired Pck2 recruitment to SGs, indicating that MAPK activation stimulates Pck2 SG translocation. Consistently, HHS-induced SGs delayed Pck2 relocalization at the cell tips, thereby blocking subsequent Pmk1 reactivation after recovery from HHS. HHS partitioned Pck2 into the Pabp-positive SG-containing fraction, which resulted in reduced Pck2 abundance and kinase activity in the soluble fraction. Taken together, these results indicate that MAPK-dependent Pck2 SG recruitment serves as a feedback mechanism to intercept PKC/MAPK activation induced by HHS, which might underlie PKC-related diseases.;polyalanine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
90;9311966;Leptin rapidly lowers food intake and elevates metabolic rates in lean and ob/ob mice.;Leptin, the ob gene product, is released from adipose tissue and likely acts in the central nervous system, particularly within the hypothalamus, to exert many of its effects. Obesity in C57BL/6J ob/ob mice is caused by a mutation in the ob gene resulting in a lack of functional leptin. In this study, we first compared effects of a single intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of 3 pmol (50 ng) or 60 pmol (1 microg) leptin on food intake and oxygen consumption of lean and ob/ob mice deprived of food for 4 h during the 48-h period postinjection. Injection of 3 pmol leptin minimally lowered food intake in these mice without influencing oxygen consumption. Injection of 60 pmol of leptin rapidly lowered food intake within 30 min in both lean and ob/ob mice, with effects persisting for 24 h. Lean and ob/ob mice treated with leptin consumed 40 and 60% less food, respectively, in 24 h than vehicle-treated controls. Injection of leptin (60 pmol ICV) suppressed food intake of adrenalectomized mice as well (by 25 and 40% in lean mice and by 20 and 68% in ob/ob mice at 3 and 24 h, respectively), indicating that glucocorticoids are not essential for leptin to suppress food intake. Leptin increased oxygen consumption in conditions in which diet-induced thermogenesis was low, i.e., in fed ob/ob mice and in food-deprived lean mice, but not in fed adrenalectomized ob/ob mice or in fed lean mice. ICV injection of 60 pmol leptin along with 230 pmol (2 microg) of neuropeptide Y (NPY) attenuated NPY-induced feeding in ob/ob, but not in lean mice, suggesting an enhanced potential for crosstalk between the leptin and NPY signaling systems in ob/ob mice lacking endogenous leptin. Leptin exerts rapid-onset actions within the central nervous system to coordinate control of food intake and metabolic rate.;-;-;-;hard_0
98;21645000;Cloning and characterization of barley caryopsis FCA.;The RNA binding protein, flowering control locus A, (FCA) regulates flowering in rice and Arabidopsis. FCA interacts with FY to auto-regulate its own transcripts as well as to control flowering by downregulating flowering locus C (FLC). We report the cloning and characterization of the gamma (γ) isoform of FCA from barley (Hordeum vulgare cv. McLeod). The deduced protein contained two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), a glycine-rich region at the N-terminal end, a polyglutamine region immediately downstream of a WW domain. Barley FCA had greater protein sequence homology to wheat and rice FCA than to its Arabidopsis homolog. In developing barley embryos, FCA transcripts could be detected from 2 days after pollination (DAP) up to 40 DAP. FCA transcript levels in mature barley embryo were more abundant in non-germinated than in germinated seeds, with the levels declining as germination progressed. ABA inhibition of germination inhibited the decline of barley embryo FCA. Transient co-expression of FCA or a truncated FCA (lacking RRM) with maize VP1 promoter or wheat Em gene promoter in barley aleurone protoplasts led to increased VP1 and Em gene promoter activity. Barley FCA or truncated FCA localized in the nucleus suggested its role in gene regulation. ;polyglutamine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
99;8387138;Spinal delta 2 but not delta 1 opioid receptors are involved in intracerebroventricular beta-endorphin-induced antinociception in the mouse.;The antinociception induced by beta-endorphin given intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) has been previously demonstrated to be mediated by the release of Met-enkephalin and subsequent stimulation of delta receptors in the spinal cord for antinociception. The present study was designed to determine what type of opioid receptor, delta 1 or delta 2, in the spinal cord is involved in i.c.v. beta-endorphin-induced antinociception. Antinociception was assessed by the tail-flick test in male ICR mice. NTB (0.2-20 nmol) and NTI (0.22-2.2 nmol), selective delta 2 receptor antagonists, given intrathecally (i.t.) dose-dependently attenuated i.c.v. beta-endorphin-induced inhibition of the tail-flick response. On the other hand, BNTX (0.02-2.2 nmol), a selective delta 1 receptor antagonist, given i.t., did not block i.c.v. beta-endorphin-induced antinociception. The tail-flick inhibition induced by DAMGO, a mu receptor agonist, or U50,488H, a kappa receptor agonist, was not blocked by i.t. BNTX, NTB or NTI. It is concluded that delta 2 but not delta 1 receptors in the spinal cord are involved in i.c.v. beta-endorphin-induced antinociception.;-;-;-;hard_0
101;2830983;Initiation protein induced helix destabilization at the lambda origin: a prepriming step in DNA replication.;The interaction of the lambda phage initiator protein, O, with the lambda origin sequence, ori, has been investigated. Binding of O, or its amino-terminal fragment, causes a major structural change within a 60 bp AT-rich region just to the right of the O-binding site. ATP or other molecular energy sources are not required. The modification, as assayed by nuclease sensitivity, is reduced when certain ori mutant sequences, which bind O but fail to replicate, are substituted for the wild-type sequence. The modification of DNA structure caused by the interaction of O is absolutely dependent on the presence of superhelical tension at the lambda origin sequence, and has several properties consistent with a strand separation reaction. We propose that this modification is a fundamental prepriming event that is the first stage in initiation of bidirectional replication in lambda after O binding. ;polythreonine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
103;10620016;Heterogeneous nuclear RNA-ribonucleoprotein F binds to DNA via an oligo(dG)-motif and is associated with RNA polymerase II.;The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein F (hnRNP-F) is one of the constituents of the splicing-related hnRNP complex. Recent studies suggest that pre-mRNA modification and splicing factors are associated with transcriptional initiation factors and RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) at a promoter, implying that pre-mRNA-engaged factors might be associated with a promoter. We isolated a cDNA of rat hnRNP-F and expressed the recombinant protein. HnRNP-F selectively bound to oligo(dG) in constructions with other oligohomonucleotides. The ssDNA of an SV40 promoter sequence having the GC-boxes was bound to hnRNP-F, while hnRNP-F bound to the (G/C)-stretch as dsDNA. Consequently, hnRNP-F was designated as an oligo(dG)-binding protein. None of the RNA-binding domains (RBDs) in hnRNP-F were critical for the oligo(dG)-binding. In contrast, the GY-rich region that exists between RBD-II and -III exhibited an oligo(dG)-binding ability. We suggest that the GY-rich region is a novel DNA-binding motif. HnRNP-F was shown to contain two types of binding motifs for RNA and DNA. Additionally, we found that hnRNP-F was co-precipitated with RNA pol II. Interestingly, the RNA pol II holoenzyme also contained hnRNP-F. The tissue distribution profile of hnRNP-F was similar to that of both RNA pol II and TBP. The above results suggest that hnRNP-F is associated with a transcriptional initiation apparatus that includes RNA pol II. The DNA-binding ability of hnRNP-F might facilitate the entry of pre-mRNA modification/splicing factors at a promoter. ;polytyrosine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
104;15102096;Epicutaneous application of CpG oligodeoxynucleotides with peptide or protein antigen promotes the generation of CTL.;Immunostimulatory oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) are effective adjuvants in the induction of humoral and cellular immune responses when administered parenterally with antigen. The skin has recently become a target organ for the design of non-invasive vaccine technologies. Using ovalbumin (OVA) as a model antigen, we demonstrate that the application of ODN sequences to tape-stripped skin promotes the induction of potent cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses to co-administered peptide. Induction of peptide-specific CTL required the presence of CpG motifs within the ODN. CTL afforded tumor protection against a tumor expressing an immunodominant OVA CTL epitope. CTL could also be induced to whole protein administered onto the skin. Differential CpG sequence activity was noted with respect to the induction of CTL to epicutaneous protein with an ODN sequence containing a poly-G motif having an optimal effect. Peptide-specific CTL could be detected in the peripheral blood as early as 6 d after a single immunization. These results highlight the potential of the bare skin as a route for vaccine development and indicate an important role for immunostimulatory ODN as adjuvants to generate functional CTL with the help of the skin immune system. ;polyglycine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
111;2725485;Stimulation of enzymatic activity in filament preparations of casein kinase II by polylysine, melittin, and spermine.;"Casein kinase II (CKII) has been purified from bovine heart tissue. Under conditions of low salt (0.05 M NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2), CKII forms structured aggregates that appear as filaments similar to results obtained with Drosophila CKII [C.V.C. Glover (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261:14349]. The aggregates have been analyzed by sucrose density gradients and electron microscopy. Filament preparations of the enzyme have reduced but measurable kinase activity. The addition of salt restores activity. Various modulators of CKII activity have been examined with the enzyme in the low salt, polymerized form. The polyamines spermine or spermidine stimulated CKII activity as much as six fold; putrescine had no effect. Polylysine of varying lengths activated CKII 4-6 fold. Melittin, the basic polypeptide from bee venom, was also an effective activator. Activation of filament preparations was also observed if the CKII specific peptide (RRREEETEEE) was used as the substrate in place of casein. These results with filament preparations provide an alternative in vitro system for the study of possible regulatory aspects of CKII.";polylysine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
116;34342116;Radically Enhanced Dual Recognition.;Complexation between a viologen radical cation (V.+ ) and cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) diradical dication (CBPQT2(.+) ) has been investigated and utilized extensively in the construction of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) and artificial molecular machines (AMMs). The selective recognition of a pair of V.+ using radical-pairing interactions, however, remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the efficient encapsulation of two methyl viologen radical cations (MV.+ ) in a size-matched bisradical dicationic host - namely, cyclobis(paraquat-2,6-naphthalene)2(.+) , i.e., CBPQN2(.+) . Central to this dual recognition process was the choice of 2,6-bismethylenenaphthalene linkers for incorporation into the bisradical dicationic host. They provide the space between the two bipyridinium radical cations in CBPQN2(.+) suitable for binding two MV.+ with relatively short (3.05-3.25 Å) radical-pairing distances. The size-matched bisradical dicationic host was found to exhibit highly selective and cooperative association with the two MV.+ in MeCN at room temperature. The formation of the tetrakisradical tetracationic inclusion complex - namely, [(MV)2 ⊂CBPQN]4(.+) - in MeCN was confirmed by VT 1 H NMR, as well as by EPR spectroscopy. The solid-state superstructure of [(MV)2 ⊂CBPQN]4(.+) reveals an uneven distribution of the binding distances (3.05, 3.24, 3.05 Å) between the three different V.+ , suggesting that localization of the radical-pairing interactions has a strong influence on the packing of the two MV.+ inside the bisradical dicationic host. Our findings constitute a rare example of binding two radical guests with high affinity and cooperativity using host-guest radical-pairing interactions. Moreover, they open up possibilities of harnessing the tetrakisradical tetracationic inclusion complex as a new, orthogonal and redox-switchable recognition motif for the construction of MIMs and AMMs.;-;-;-;hard_0

Drawing on a range of published research that explores the heterogeneous experiences of embodied ageing, the paper highlights the continuity of phenomenological structures of experience across successful ageing, normal ageing and frailty, suggesting the permeability and contestability of the boundaries between them and highlighting the complexity of health and illness in old age. Such data suggests a need to question the perception of frailty as something both apart from 'normal' ageing, and constitutive of frailed or failed ageing, and challenges the construction of the third age/fourth age polarity that underpins much of the meaning accorded to old age today.;-;-;-;hard_0
120;234969;Chromatin-associated protein phosphokinases of rat ventral prostate. Characteristics and effects of androgenic status.;"Protein phosphokinase activity endogenous to rat ventral prostate chromatin was assayed by using edphosphophosvitin as an exogenous substrate. For maximal activity of the kinase reaction, the presence of 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM dithiothreitol was essential. Two apparent pH optima were observed, a broad one between pH 7 and 7.4, and one at pH 7.89. At pH 7.4 the apparent Km for 31% dephosphophosvitin was 0.3 mg per ml. With respect to ATP, two apparent Km values (0.04 and 0.41 mM) were found. The kinase activity was minimal toward exogenous histones when used as substrates (3% for lysine-rich and 0.3% for arginine-rich (f3) histones, compared with dephosphophosvitin controls). The protein phosphokinases were not significantly stimulated by cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) when histones used as substrate. With dephosphophosvitin as substrate, cyclic AMP produced a small inhibition (5 to 15%). Orchiectomy of adult rats resulted in a rapid decline in the chromatin-associated protein phosphokinase activity assayed using optimal experimental condition described above. At 9 hours postorchiectomy, a 30% decline in the activity was observed; this was further reduced to about 50% of the control by 18 hours. This decrease in the kinase activity (e.g. at 9 hours postorchiectomy) appears to precede measurable changes in the protein and RNA complements of chromatin. Testosterone replacement following orchiectomy abolished this decline in the chromatin-associated activity. The chromatin-associated protein phosphokinase activity toward lysine-rich and arginine-rich histones was also sensitive to androgenic status of the animals and declined rapidly postorchiectomy. The results suggest the presence of multiple and androgen-sensitive protien phosphokinases associated with rat ventral prostate chromatin, which may modulate the phosphorylation of nuclear nonhistone phosphoproteins with changing gene action mediated by testosterone in this target tissue.

The jelly fig PME extracted from achenes was isoelectrofocused at pH 2.5 and subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing. A cDNA fragment encoding the mature protein of this acidic PME was obtained by PCR cloning using a poly(T) primer and a degenerate primer designed according to the N-terminal sequence of the purified PME. The complete cDNA sequence of its precursor protein was further obtained by PCR using the same strategy. The PME clone was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and its expressed protein was immunologically recognized as strongly as the original antigen using antibodies against purified PME. Fractionation analysis revealed that the overexpressed PME was predominantly present in the pellet and thus presumably formed insoluble inclusion bodies in E. coli cells. ;polythreonine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
127;12573292;Structural changes and facilitated association of tropoelastin.;Circular dichroism studies of tropoelastin secondary structure show 4+/-1% alpha-helix in aqueous solutions. This is in contrast to the substantially higher amounts (up to 23+/-7%) of alpha-helix predicted by computer algorithms, which propose that regions of alpha-helix are limited to the alanine-rich cross-linking domains. Through the addition of trifluoroethanol, the amount of alpha-helix increased to 17+/-1%, equivalent to that expected on the basis of primary structure. The physiological ability of the protein to coacervate and the critical concentration of monomer required for coacervation were unaffected by levels of alpha-helix. However, the temperature required for coacervation decreased linearly with increasing alpha-helical structure, which correlates with the participation of alpha-helices in association. We propose that the alanine-rich cross-linking domains exist as nascent helices in tropoelastin in aqueous solution. We further suggest a novel mechanism for coacervation whereby formation of alpha-helices and subsequent helical side chain interactions limit the conformational flexibility of the polypeptide, to facilitate associations between hydrophobic domains during elastogenesis. ;polyalanine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
129;17938583;Replication timing profile reflects the distinct functional and genomic features of the MHC class II region.;The timing of DNA replication generally correlates with transcription, gene density and sequence composition. How is the timing affected if a genomic region has a combination of features that individually correlate with either early or late replication? The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II region is an AT-rich isochore that would be expected to replicate late, but it also contains coordinately regulated genes that are highly expressed in antigen-presenting cells and are strongly inducible in other cell types. Using cytological and biochemical assays, we find that the entire MHC replicates within the first half of S-phase, and that the class II region replicates slightly later than the adjacent regions irrespective of gene expression. These data suggest that despite AT-richness, an early-to-middle replication time in the class II region is defined by an open chromatin conformation that allows rapid transcriptional activation as a defence against pathogens. ;polythreonine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
133;20478537;Protein kinase R contributes to immunity against specific viruses by regulating interferon mRNA integrity.;Cytosolic viral RNA recognition by the helicases RIG-I and MDA5 is considered the major pathway for IFN-alpha/beta induction in response to RNA viruses. However, other cytoplasmic RNA sensors, including the double-stranded RNA-binding protein kinase R (PKR), have been implicated in IFN-alpha/beta production, although their relative contribution and mechanism have been unclear. Using cells expressing nonfunctional PKR or reduced levels of kinase, we show that PKR is required for production of IFN-alpha/beta proteins in response to a subset of RNA viruses including encephalomyocarditis, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis, and Semliki Forest virus, but not influenza or Sendai virus. Surprisingly, although IFN-alpha/beta mRNA induction is largely normal in PKR-deficient cells, much of that mRNA lacks the poly(A) tail, indicating that its integrity is compromised. Our results suggest that PKR plays a nonredundant role in IFN-alpha/beta production in response to some but not all viruses, in part by regulating IFN-alpha/beta mRNA stability. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
134;7479000;RNA polymerase III dependence of the human L1 promoter and possible participation of the RNA polymerase II factor YY1 in the RNA polymerase III transcription system.;From the general views of the eukaryotic transcription systems, L1 (or L1-like) retrotransposons that encode some proteins are unusual. L1, unlike other protein-coding elements, is transcribed through an internal promoter. And the L1 internal promoter, unlike other internal promoters, is thought to be RNA polymerase II (pol II) dependent, because the L1 transcript has a large size (approximately 6 kb), protein coding capacity and a 3' terminal polyadenylation signal followed by a poly(A) tail, and also because transcription from the promoter of Drosophila L1-like element jockey was highly sensitive to alpha-amanitin. However, our in vitro transcription study reveals that transcription from the human L1 promoter is highly sensitive to tagetitoxin, a selective inhibitor of RNA polymerase III (pol III), but insensitive to 1 micrograms/ml of alpha-amanitin, indicating that the human L1 promoter is pol III-dependent. The pol III dependence is further supported by our observation that L1 and pol III-dependent tRNA gene promoters share a common nuclear factor YY1. There is evidence that YY1 is also a pol II transcription factor. We thus propose that YY1 is a possible member of the pol III transcription system.; polyalanine ;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

138;8642478;Avian metallothioneins: structure, regulation and evolution.;This article reviews studies of the molecular biology of the avian metallothionein (MT) genes. Analysis of cloned genes and/or cDNAs from chicken, turkey, pheasant and quail suggests that each of these species possesses a very simple MT gene family. The MT from these birds is a cysteine-rich protein of 63 amino acids that shares extensive structural homology with the mammalian MTs, and, remarkably, the deduced amino acid sequence of the major metallothionein is identical in each of these birds. The chicken MT gene is inducible by dietary or injected metal ions [i.e., zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu)], bacterial lipopolysaccharide and oxidative stress. Furthermore, it is expressed during liver development. The turkey and chicken MT genes are identical in gross structure to other functional MT genes. They consist of three exons separated by two intervening sequences. Comparisons of the nucleotide sequences of the turkey and chicken MT genes revealed regions of exceptionally high sequence conservation, suggesting important functions such as splicing, polyadenylation and transcriptional activation. Structure-function studies of the chicken MT promoter using transient transfection assays and transgenic mice have revealed cis-acting promoter sequences involved in the induction of chicken MT gene expression by metals ions. A metal-responsive enhancer was located in the proximal 107-bp of the chicken MT promoter in a region highly conserved in both the turkey and chicken MT genes. Function of this enhancer element apparently requires cooperation of transcription factors interacting with an Sp 1 binding site and a single palindromic metal-responsive element. In this regard, the structure of the proximal region of the chicken and turkey MT promoters is unique. Our current studies suggest that this enhancer regulates gene expression in a position-independent manner in transgenic mice.;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
140;8663083;Dephosphorylation of Sp1 by protein phosphatase 1 is involved in the glucose-mediated activation of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene.;When mouse 30A5 preadipocytes are exposed to high glucose concentrations, acetyl-CoA carboxylase is induced through glucose activation of promoter II of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase gene. Glucose treatment of the cells increases Sp1 binding to two GC-rich glucose response elements in promoter II. We have investigated the mechanism by which glucose increases Sp1 binding and transactivation of promoter II in 30A5 cells. DNA mobility shift assays have shown that nuclear extracts from glucose-treated cells exhibit increased Sp1 binding activity. This increase in the binding activity is not due to glucose-mediated changes in the amount of Sp1 in the nucleus but to an increase in the activity that modifies Sp1 so that it binds more effectively to the promoter sequence. This Sp1 modifying activity is inhibited by okadaic acid and phosphatase inhibitor 2, and has a molecular mass of 38-42 kDa. The catalytic subunit of type 1 protein phosphatase, whose molecular mass is 38 kDa, also increased the ability of Sp1 to bind to promoter II. Treatment of nuclear extract with antibodies against the catalytic subunit partially suppressed the nuclear activity for Sp1 activation. From these results, we conclude that the Sp1 transcription factor exhibits enhanced binding to promoter II and transcriptional activation is the result of glucose-induced dephosphorylation by type 1 phosphatase. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
143;17333257;Identification and analysis of cabut orthologs in invertebrates and vertebrates.;Cabut (cbt) is a Drosophila melanogaster gene involved in epidermal dorsal closure (DC). Its expression is dependent on the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascade, and it functions downstream of Jun regulating dpp expression in the leading edge cells. The Cbt protein contains three C(2)H(2)-type zinc fingers and a serine-rich domain, suggesting that it functions as a transcription factor. We have identified single cbt orthologs in other Drosophila species, as well as in other insects and invertebrate organisms like ascidians and echinoderms, but not in nematodes. Gene structure and protein sequence are highly conserved among Drosophilidae, but are more diverged in the other species of invertebrates analyzed. According to this, we demonstrate that cbt expression is detected in the embryonic lateral epidermis in several Drosophila species, as it occurs in D. melanogaster, thus suggesting that the cbt orthologs may have a conserved role in these species during DC. We have also analyzed the genomes of several vertebrate species, finding that the cbt orthologous genes in these organisms encode proteins that belong to the TIEG family of Sp1-like/Krüppel-like transcription factors. Phylogenetic analysis of the invertebrate and vertebrate proteins identified indicates that they mainly follow the expected phylogeny of the species, and that the cbt gene was duplicated during vertebrate evolution. Because we were not able to identify cbt orthologous genes neither in yeast nor in plants, our results suggest that this gene has been probably conserved throughout metazoans and that it may play a fundamental role in animal biology. ;polyserine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function

158;1847364;Analysis of the Escherichia coli nusA10(Cs) allele: relating nucleotide changes to phenotypes.;The Escherichia coli nusA gene product, known to influence transcription elongation, is essential for both bacterial viability and growth of lambdoid phages. We report the cloning and sequencing of the conditionally lethal nusA10(Cs) allele. Changes from nusA+ were observed at nucleotides 311 and 634. Functional studies showed that both nucleotide changes are necessary for the cold-sensitive phenotype, although bacteria with the change at 634 grew more slowly at 30 degrees C than the nusA+ controls. The mutant nusA10(Cs) gene product is not as active as nusA+ in supporting transcription antitermination mediated by the N regulatory protein of bacteriophage lambda. The change at nucleotide 634 is shown to be solely responsible for this phenotype. Four differences were found between the nusA+ gene that we sequenced and the published nusA sequence. These changes alter the reading frame of nusA in a functionally important domain [as identified by the nusA1 and nusA11(Ts) mutations], resulting in an arginine-rich region that may be involved with RNA binding.;polyarginine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
161;8768794;Intermediate filaments and gene regulation.;The biological role of intermediate filaments (IFs) of eukaryotic cells is still a matter of conjecture. On the basis of immunofluorescence and electron microscopic observations, they appear to play a cytoskeletal role in that they stabilize cellular structure and organize the distribution and interactions of intracellular organelles and components. The expression of a large number of cell type-specific and developmentally regulated subunit proteins is believed to provide multicellular organisms with different IF systems capable of differential interactions with the various substructures and components of their multiple, differentiated cells. However, the destruction of distinct IF systems by manipulation of cultured cells or by knock-out mutation of IF subunit proteins in transgenic mice exerts relatively little influence on cellular morphology and physiology and on development of mutant animals. In order to rationalize this dilemma, the cytoskeletal concept of IF function has been extended to purport that cytoplasmic (c) IFs and their subunit proteins also play fundamental roles in gene regulation. It is based on the in vitro capacity of cIF(protein)s to interact with guanine-rich, single-stranded DNA, supercoiled DNA and histones, as well as on their close structural relatedness to gene-regulatory DNA-binding and nuclear matrix proteins. Since cIF proteins do not possess classical nuclear localization signals, it is proposed that cIFs directly penetrate the double nuclear membrane, exploiting the amphiphilic, membrane-active character of their subunit proteins. Since they can establish metastable multisite contacts with nuclear matrix structures and/or chromatin areas containing highly repetitive DNA sequence elements at the nuclear periphery, they are supposed to participate in chromosome distribution and chromatin organization in interphase nuclei of differentiated cells. Owing to their different DNA-binding specificities, the various cIF systems may in this way specify different chromatin organizations and thus the expression of distinct sets of cell- or tissue-specific proteins. In support of this, different type III IFs have been shown to preferentially interact with guanine-rich, highly repetitive, double-stranded fragments of total genomic DNA, including chromosomal telomere sequences. Surprisingly, they also bound AT-rich, centromeric satellite DNA sequences with high efficiency. Since most of the affinity-isolated, non-telomeric and -centromeric DNA fragments contain regulatory elements that are normally located in 5'/3'-flanking and intron regions of genes, cIFs may activate gene expression or repress it as the result of telomeric and centromeric position effects. However, the nucleotide sequences of the cIF-bound, genomic DNA fragments also predict the involvement of cIF(protein)s in recombination and hence in evolutionary processes. Based on these observations, the initially observed minor effects of cIF protein knock-out mutations on the phenotype of transgenic mice may be interpreted as a redundancy phenomenon operating at the levels of the cytoskeleton and gene expression, whereas the capacity of the mutated animals to adapt to new environments via recombination processes may be severely disturbed and, as such, perceivable only after many generations of less favorable living conditions.;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Both types of vertebrate-rearranging antigen receptors are similarly diverse, with repertoires that can potentially exceed 10(14) unique receptors. In order to characterize antigen-binding properties of the VLRs, we developed a high-throughput yeast surface display platform for the isolation of monoclonal VLRs. We have isolated VLRs that specifically bind hen egg lysozyme, β-galactosidase, cholera toxin subunit B, R-phycoerythrin, and the blood group trisaccharides A and B, with binding affinities in the mid-nanomolar to mid-picomolar range. VLRs may, thus, be excellent single-chain alternatives to Ig-based antibodies for biotechnology applications. ;polyleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
167;8389924;Biochemical analysis of mutants with changes in the origin-binding domain of simian virus 40 tumor antigen.;The role of the origin-binding domain of simian virus 40 large tumor antigen (T antigen) in the initiation of virus DNA replication was investigated by analyzing the biochemical activities of a series of mutants with single-site substitutions in this region. These activities include origin-specific and nonspecific DNA binding, melting of the imperfect palindromic sequence, untwisting of the AT-rich region, unwinding of origin-containing DNA, helicase activity, and the ability to oligomerize normally in response to ATP. Three classes of T-antigen mutants that are unable to support virus replication in monkey cells are described. Class 1 mutants are unable to bind to the origin of DNA replication but are able to bind to DNA nonspecifically. Class 2 mutants exhibit defective binding to both types of DNA. As expected, mutants in these first two classes are unable to unwind origin DNA. Surprisingly, however, these mutants possess significant levels of melting and untwisting activities, suggesting that these reactions may not be solely dependent on the ability of the protein to recognize origin sequences. Most class 1 mutants oligomerize normally in response to ATP, indicating that their DNA-binding defects are not due to structural alterations but probably to a failure to directly recognize origin sequences. In contrast, class 2 mutants exhibit defective oligomerization. Class 3 mutants bind to origin and nonorigin DNA at near wild-type levels and melt and untwist origin DNA normally but exhibit defective oligomerization and unwinding. These mutants are, however, perfectly able to carry out the helicase reaction, indicating that their unwinding defect is at some step after melting but before a nonspecific helicase is used to separate parental strands during replication. These results therefore suggest that proper oligomerization to correctly position the molecules on the DNA may be more important in initiating unwinding than in bringing about efficient DNA binding, inducing structural changes in the DNA, or carrying out the helicase reaction.;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

The longest cDNA predicts a protein of 312 amino acids (aa), which possesses a putative RNA-binding motif and a highly charged N-terminal region composed of three basic polylysine blocks. The aa sequence comparison of D. melanogaster eIF-2 beta with its human and yeast counterparts demonstrates a high degree of similarity, especially within the C-terminal region.

Targeting LRRK2 with selective, brain-permeable kinase inhibitors is a promising approach to reduce toxicity, and thus is a major goal of clinical development. Understanding the specific signaling cascades triggered by LRRK2 mutations will be key to this aim. This article is part of a special issue on Parkinson disease.

171;19416890;Von Willebrand factor-binding protein is a hysteretic conformational activator of prothrombin.;Von Willebrand factor-binding protein (VWbp), secreted by Staphylococcus aureus, displays secondary structural homology to the 3-helix bundle, D1 and D2 domains of staphylocoagulase (SC), a potent conformational activator of the blood coagulation zymogen, prothrombin (ProT). In contrast to the classical proteolytic activation mechanism of trypsinogen-like serine proteinase zymogens, insertion of the first 2 residues of SC into the NH(2)-terminal binding cleft on ProT (molecular sexuality) induces rapid conformational activation of the catalytic site. Based on plasma-clotting assays, the target zymogen for VWbp may be ProT, but this has not been verified, and the mechanism of ProT activation is unknown. We demonstrate that VWbp activates ProT conformationally in a mechanism requiring its Val(1)-Val(2) residues. By contrast to SC, full time-course kinetic studies of ProT activation by VWbp demonstrate that it activates ProT by a substrate-dependent, hysteretic kinetic mechanism. VWbp binds weakly to ProT (K(D) 2.5 microM) to form an inactive complex, which is activated through a slow conformational change by tripeptide chromogenic substrates and its specific physiological substrate, identified here as fibrinogen (Fbg). This mechanism increases the specificity of ProT activation by delaying it in a slow reversible process, with full activation requiring binding of Fbg through an exosite expressed on the activated ProT*.VWbp complex. The results suggest that this unique mechanism regulates pathological fibrin (Fbn) deposition to VWF-rich areas during S. aureus endocarditis. ;polyphenylalanine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
175;9632818;Normal myeloid development requires both the glutamine-rich transactivation domain and the PEST region of transcription factor PU.1 but not the potent acidic transactivation domain.;Gene targeting of transcription factor PU.1 results in an early block to fetal hematopoiesis, with no detectable lymphoid or myeloid cells produced in mouse embryos. Furthermore, PU.1(-/-) embryonic stem (ES) cells fail to differentiate into Mac-1(+) and F4/80(+) macrophages in vitro. We have previously shown that a PU.1 transgene under the control of its own promoter restores the ability of PU. 1(-/-) ES cells to differentiate into macrophages. In this study, we take advantage of our PU.1(-/-) ES cell rescue system to genetically test which previously identified PU.1 functional domains are necessary for the development of mature macrophages. PU.1 functional domains include multiple N-terminal acidic and glutamine-rich transactivation domains, a PEST domain, several serine phosphorylation sites, and a C-terminal Ets DNA binding domain, all delineated and characterized by using standard biochemical and transactivational assays. By using the production of mature macrophages as a functional readout in our assay system, we have established that the glutamine-rich transactivation domain, a portion of the PEST domain, and the DNA binding domain are required for myelopoiesis. Deletion of three acidic domains, which exhibit potent transactivation potential in vitro, had no effect on the ability of PU.1 to promote macrophage development. Furthermore, mutagenesis of four independent sites of serine phosphorylation also had no effect on myelopoiesis. Collectively, our results indicate that PU.1 interacts with important regulatory proteins during macrophage development via the glutamine-rich and PEST domains. The PU.1(-/-) ES cell rescue system represents a powerful, in vitro strategy to functionally map domains of PU.1 essential for normal hematopoiesis and the generation of mature macrophages. ;polyglutamine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
180;20351174;skn-1-Dependent and -independent regulation of aip-1 expression following metabolic stress in Caenorhabditis elegans.;Maintenance of a stable, properly folded, and catalytically active proteome is a major challenge to organisms in the face of multiple internal and external stresses which damage proteins and lead to protein misfolding. Here we show that internal metabolic stress produced by reactive intermediates resulting from tyrosine degradation triggers the expression of the aip-1 gene, which is critical in responses to the environmental toxin arsenic and the clearance of unstable polyglutamine and Abeta proteins. aip-1 acts via binding to the proteosome and enhancing proteosomal function. We find that full induction of aip-1 depends on the oxidative-stress-responsive skn-1 transcription factor but significant induction still occurs without skn-1. Importantly, activation of skn-1 with wdr-23(RNAi), which dramatically induces the expression of other skn-1 target genes, produces a minimal increase in aip-1 expression. This suggests that the previously demonstrated specificity in aip-1/AIRAP induction could reflect the actions of multiple synergistic activators, such as the heat shock factor homolog hsf-1, which we also find is required for full induction. These may be triggered by proteosome dysfunction, as we find that this event links the multiple inducers of aip-1. Together, our results show that cell stress triggers aip-1 expression by both skn-1-dependent and -independent pathways. ;polyglutamine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
181;7357001;Study of the interaction of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase with DNA.;Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase binds to homologous and heterologous single-stranded but not double-stranded DNA. Binding to RNA, poly(A) and poly(dA-dT) has also been observed. Enzyme binding to these nucleic acids leads to the formation of an insoluble complex which can be sedimented at low speed. The interaction of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase with DNA is strongly inhibited by NAD and NADH but not by NADP. Adenine nucleotides, which inhibit the dehydrogenase activity by competing with NAD for its binding site (Yang, S.T. and Deal, W.C., Jr. (1969) Biochemistry 8, 2806--2813), also inhibit enzyme binding to DNA, whereas glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and inorganic phosphate are non-inhibitory. These results suggest that DNA interacts through the NAD binding sites of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. In accordance with this idea, it was found that DNA also binds to lactate dehydrogenase, an enzyme containing a similar dinucleotide binding domain, and that this binding is inhibited by NADH. A study of the base specificity of the DNA-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase interaction using dinucleoside monophosphates shows that inhibition of DNA binding by the dinucleotides requires the presence of a 3'-terminal adenosine and is greater when the 5'-terminus contains a pyrimidine instead of a purine. These results suggest that the dinucleotides bind at the NAD site of the dehydrogenase and that the enzyme would interact preferentially with PypA dinucleotides present in the nucleic acid.; polyalanine ;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
182;8077164;Subsyndromal symptomatic depression: a new mood disorder?;Secondary analyses in a subsample (N = 9160) of the National Institute of Mental Health Epidemiologic Catchment Area Program data base revealed that 19.6% of the general population reported one or more depressive symptoms in the previous month. One-year prevalence of two or more depressive symptoms in the general population was 11.8%, a prevalence figure exceeding the 9.5% 1-year prevalence for all the DSM-III mood disorders combined. We have labeled this potential clinical condition as subsyndromal symptomatic depression (SSD), defining it as any two or more simultaneous symptoms of depression, present for most or all of the time, at least 2 weeks in duration, associated with evidence of social dysfunction, occurring in individuals who do not meet criteria for diagnoses of minor depression, major depression, and/or dysthymia. SSD has a 1-year prevalence in the general population of 8.4%, two thirds of whom are women (63.4%). The most common SSD symptoms reported are insomnia (44.7%), feeling tired out all the time (42.1%), recurrent thoughts of death (31.0%), trouble concentrating (22.7%), significant weight gain (18.5%), slowed thinking (15.1%), and hypersomnia (15.1%). Increased prevalence of disability and welfare benefits was found in SSD as compared with respondents with no depressive symptoms. SSD represents a significant clinical population not covered by any DSM-III, DSM-III-R, or DSM-IV mood disorder diagnosis. Since SSD is also associated with significant increases in social dysfunction and disability, we feel there is good evidence to conclude that SSD is an unrecognized clinical condition of considerable public health importance that is deserving of further characterization and study.;-;-;-;hard_0
183;500199;Sites that bind polymerized albumin on hepatitis B surface antigen particles: detection by radioimmunoassay.;"Antibodies to polymerized human albumin (poly-HSA) could not be detected by using sensitive methods (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and radioimmunoprecipitation) in sera from chronic carriers of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or in serial bleedings from one chimpanzee infected with type A hepatitis virus and one infected with non-A, non-B hepatitis virus. By a solid-phase radioimmunoassay, receptor sites for poly-HSA could be detected on HBsAg particles from sera containing either hepatitis B ""e"" antigen (HBeAg) or anti-HBe. Blocking experiments showed that monomeric HSA did not bind to this receptor. In general, the HBsAg particles from sera with HBeAg had more poly-HSA receptor sites or relatively more particles carrying this receptor compared with HBsAg from sera with anti-HBe. Microtiter plates coated with poly-HSA bound HBsAg from sera containing HBeAg with greater efficiency than did anti-HBs coupled to a solid phase (Ausria II beads), whereas with sera positive for anti-HBe, the two assays were equally sensitive. Decreased ability of HBsAg to bind to poly-HSA was seen in some sera which had been stored for a few years at 4 degrees C, whereas the binding to anti-HBs was unaffected. It is possible that polymers of albumin on the surface of hepatocytes could function as receptors for hepatitis B virus.";polyhistidine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
186;22990970;The zinc finger protein TcZFP2 binds target mRNAs enriched during Trypanosoma cruzi metacyclogenesis.;Trypanosomes are parasitic protozoa in which gene expression is primarily controlled through the regulation of mRNA stability and translation. This post-transcriptional control is mediated by various families of RNA-binding proteins, including those with zinc finger CCCH motifs. CCCH zinc finger proteins have been shown to be essential to differentiation events in trypanosomatid parasites. Here, we functionally characterise TcZFP2 as a predicted post-transcriptional regulator of differentiation in Trypanosoma cruzi. This protein was detected in cell culture-derived amastigotes and trypomastigotes, but it was present in smaller amounts in metacyclic trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi. We use an optimised recombinant RNA immunopreciptation followed by microarray analysis assay to identify TcZFP2 target mRNAs. We further demonstrate that TcZFP2 binds an A-rich sequence in which the adenosine residue repeats are essential for high-affinity recognition. An analysis of the expression profiles of the genes encoding the TcZFP2-associated mRNAs throughout the parasite life cycle by microarray hybridisation showed that most of the associated mRNAs were upregulated in the metacyclic trypomastigote forms, also suggesting a role for TcZFP2 in metacyclic trypomastigote differentiation. Knockdown of the orthologous Trypanosoma brucei protein levels showed ZFP2 to be a positive regulator of specific target mRNA abundance. ;polyalanine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
194;22199294;Investigation of cell death induced by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea in cell lines of human origin and implication of RNA binding protein alterations.;Methylating agents, a widely used class of anticancer drugs, induce DNA methylation adducts, the most biologically significant being O(6)-methylguanine. The efficacy of these drugs depends on the interplay of three DNA repair systems: base excision repair (BER), methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) and direct damage reversal by O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). An MGMT-inducible, MMR- and BER-proficient HeLa cell line was treated with different concentrations of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU), a model S(N)1 methylating agent, analogous to widely used methylating cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, under different expression levels of the repair enzyme (MGMT). MNU induced MGMT-dependent apoptotic cell death. In this particular cellular context, the induction of apoptosis was accompanied by modifications of the RNA binding protein poly(A)polymerase and significant down-regulation of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) C1/C2. These results implicate alterations of the above mentioned RNA binding proteins in S(N)1 methylating agent-induced cell death and apoptosis, providing a possible perspective regarding their use as biomarkers of tumor resistance/sensitivity to chemotherapy. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Positive RAST and skin test results could be found in patients with anaphylactic shock, urticaria and serum sickness-like reaction and sometimes in a special group of exanthems, which are characterized by the existence of many different lesions at the same time, therefore called 'polymorphic exanthems', and often observed after high-dosage penicillin therapy. In cases of scarlatiniform or morbilliform exanthems no positive results were found. The BPO-specific RAST showed an overall correlation of 95-I% with skin tests using PPL. However, some patients with positive skin tests to benzylpenicillin and penicilloic acid did no have detectable circulating IgE antibodies to BPO. This emphasizes the need for including these antigens in in vitro methods. The RAST was informative even at the allergic reaction or in the first 15 days afterwards and seems to be very valuable for early diagnosis of penicillin allergy especially in cases when many drugs have been given. ;polylysine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

The concentration was always elevated when the disease was active, even in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment, and fell rapidly in association with clinical remission induced by immunosuppression. During periods of complete remission, in the absence of any intercurrent condition, the value remained within the normal range. The correlation between C-reactive protein level and disease activity was much closer than that between erythrocyte sedimentation rate and disease activity.

202;31476945;'Wargaming with the chiefs': A novel pre-mortem exercise to enhance communication and well-being among 'top gun' chief residents.;"Pilots who complete the 'TOPGUN' program return to their squadrons as elite leaders and instructors. Physicians from all specialties who are selected to become Chief residents can also be viewed as 'Top Guns', as they are the 'cream of the crop'; having been chosen to be the leaders and role-models for all the other residents in their programs. Yet, unlike Top Gun pilots, Chief residents are arguably only minimally prepared for this new role. Wargaming involves generating every possible bad outcome and brainstorming contingencies for these possible outcomes. We developed an exercise for the incoming Chiefs (ICs) and outgoing Chiefs (OCs) in four specialties: Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, Neurosurgery, and Neurology. Following this exercise, 100% of the Chiefs in all four programs indicated that this activity was beneficial and the majority agreed that wargaming improved communication and their own feelings of well-being. Based on our trainees' feedback, it appears that wargaming is a simple, fun, and highly-interactive exercise which increases perceived control among ICs and allows OCs the chance to reflect and share their knowledge and experience with the new Chiefs. This activity also seems to enhance communication and feelings of well-being among both incoming and outgoing Chief residents.";-;-;-;hard_0
203;14573481;Likelihood models of somatic mutation and codon substitution in cancer genes.;The role of somatic mutation in cancer is well established and several genes have been identified that are frequent targets. This has enabled large-scale screening studies of the spectrum of somatic mutations in cancers of particular organs. Cancer gene mutation databases compile the results of many studies and can provide insight into the importance of specific amino acid sequences and functional domains in cancer, as well as elucidate aspects of the mutation process. Past studies of the spectrum of cancer mutations (in particular genes) have examined overall frequencies of mutation (at specific nucleotides) and of missense, nonsense, and silent substitution (at specific codons) both in the sequence as a whole and in a specific functional domain. Existing methods ignore features of the genetic code that allow some codons to mutate to missense, or stop, codons more readily than others (i.e., by one nucleotide change, vs. two or three). A new codon-based method to estimate the relative rate of substitution (fixation of a somatic mutation in a cancer cell lineage) of nonsense vs. missense mutations in different functional domains and in different tumor tissues is presented. Models that account for several potential influences on rates of somatic mutation and substitution in cancer progenitor cells and allow biases of mutation rates for particular dinucleotide sequences (CGs and dipyrimidines), transition vs. transversion bias, and variable rates of silent substitution across functional domains (useful in detecting investigator sampling bias) are considered. Likelihood-ratio tests are used to choose among models, using cancer gene mutation data. The method is applied to analyze published data on the spectrum of p53 mutations in cancers. A novel finding is that the ratio of the probability of nonsense to missense substitution is much lower in the DNA-binding and transactivation domains (ratios near 1) than in structural domains such as the linker, tetramerization (oligomerization), and proline-rich domains (ratios exceeding 100 in some tissues), implying that the specific amino acid sequence may be less critical in structural domains (e.g., amino acid changes less often lead to cancer). The transition vs. transversion bias and effect of CpG dinucleotides on mutation rates in p53 varied greatly across cancers of different organs, likely reflecting effects of different endogenous and exogenous factors influencing mutation in specific organs. ;polyproline;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

The entire mitochondrial genome was purified by gene amplification using long polymerase chain reaction (long PCR), and the products were subsequently used as templates for PCR with 30 sets of newly designed, fish-universal primers that amplify contiguous, overlapping segments of the entire genome. Direct sequencing of the PCR products showed that the genome contained the same 37 mitochondrial structural genes as found in other vertebrates (two ribosomal RNA, 22 transfer RNA, and 13 protein-coding genes), with the order of all rRNA and protein-coding genes, and 19 tRNA genes being identical to that in typical vertebrates. The gene order of the three tRNAs (tRNA(Glu), tRNA(Thr), and tRNA(Pro)) relative to cytochrome b, however, differed from that determined in other vertebrates. Two steps of tandem duplication of gene regions, each followed by deletions of genes, can be invoked as mechanisms generating such rearrangements of tRNAs. This is the first example of tRNA gene rearrangements in a bony fish mitochondrial genome.;-;-;-;hard_0

Although people generally recognize the danger associated with hot tap water, many are unaware of the short exposure periods that can result in serious burns. Tap-water scalds are preventable. Both active and passive prevention measures are beneficial in reducing this serious health hazard.

207;12670929;Characterization of a nuclear export signal within the human T cell leukemia virus type I transactivator protein Tax.;Human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) is the etiologic agent of adult T cell leukemia and HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis. The HTLV-I transactivator protein Tax plays an integral role in the etiology of adult T cell leukemia, as expression of Tax in T lymphocytes has been shown to result in immortalization. In addition, Tax is known to interface with numerous transcription factor families, including activating transcription factor/cAMP response element-binding protein and nuclear factor-kappaB, requiring Tax to localize to both the nucleus and cytoplasm. In this report, the nucleocytoplasmic localization of Tax was examined in Jurkat, HeLa, and U-87 MG cells. The results reported herein indicate that Tax contains a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) that, when fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP), can direct nuclear export via the CRM-1 pathway, as determined by leptomycin B inhibition of nuclear export. However, cytoplasmic localization of full-length Tax was not altered by treatment with leptomycin B, suggesting that native Tax utilizes another nuclear export pathway. Additional support for the presence of a functional NES has also been shown because the NES mutant Tax(L200A)-GFP localized to the nuclear membrane in the majority of U-87 MG cells. Evidence has also been provided suggesting that the Tax NES likely exists as a conditionally masked signal because the truncation mutant TaxDelta214-GFP localized constitutively to the cytoplasm. These results suggest that Tax localization may be directed by specific changes in Tax conformation or by specific interactions with cellular proteins leading to changes in the availability of the Tax NES and nuclear localization signal. ;polyleucine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

Biol. Chem. 267, 25927-25933]. The Ca2+ sensitivity of the lung alpha-actinin for the interaction with polymerized actin (F-actin) was much lower than those of the other reported non-muscle alpha-actinins. Here, we isolated a cDNA clone encoding the novel alpha-actinin by screening a chicken lung lambda g11 cDNA library with antibody specific for the low-Ca(2+)-sensitive alpha-actinin. The deduced amino acid sequence of the lung alpha-actinin showed 76%, 82% and 83% identity to those of chicken skeletal muscle, smooth-muscle and fibroblast-type alpha-actinin, respectively. Marked difference in the structure between the lung-type and the other alpha-actinins was found in the extreme NH2-terminal and in the COOH-terminal half; in the third and fourth regions of four spectrin-like repeats, and in two Ca(2+)-binding EF-hand consensus regions. The NH2-terminal-side EF-hand contained a notable defect in one of the five oxygen-containing amino acid side chains involved in chelating Ca2+, suggesting that the lower Ca2+ sensitivity of the lung alpha-actinin is ascribable to this defect. Northern blot analysis showed that the expression pattern of lung-type alpha-actinin mRNA in various non-muscle tissues differed from that of the other known non-muscle-type (fibroblast-type) alpha-actinin. The present results clearly demonstrate the existence of two structurally and functionally different types of non-muscle alpha-actinin; high-Ca(2+)-sensitive-type (NM1) and low-Ca(2+)-sensitive-type (NM2) alpha-actinin.";-;-;-;hard_0
211;27251094;Conditions for Long-Term Culture of Cattle Undifferentiated Spermatogonia.;Continual and robust spermatogenesis relies on the actions of an undifferentiated spermatogonial population that contains stem cells. A remarkable feature of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) is the capacity to regenerate spermatogenesis following isolation from a donor testis and transplantation into a permissive recipient testis. This capacity has enormous potential as a tool for enhancing the reproductive capacity of livestock, which can improve production efficiency. Because SSCs are a rare subset of the undifferentiated spermatogonial population, a period of in vitro amplification in number following isolation from donor testicular tissue is essential. Here, we describe methodology for isolation of a cell fraction from prepubertal bull testes that is enriched for undifferentiated spermatogonia and long-term maintenance of the cells in both the feeder cell coculture and the feeder-free format. To achieve this method, we derived bovine fetal fibroblasts (BFF) to serve as feeders for optimizing medium conditions that promote maintenance of bovine undifferentiated spermatogonia for at least 2 mo. In addition, we devised a feeder-free system with BFF-conditioned medium that sustained bovine undifferentiated spermatogonia for at least 1 mo in vitro. The methodologies described could be optimized to provide platforms for exponential expansion of bovine SSCs that will provide the numbers needed for transplantation into recipient testes.;-;-;-;hard_0
212;8233829;A novel transforming growth factor-beta 1 responsive cytoplasmic trans-acting factor binds selectively to the 3'-untranslated region of mammalian ribonucleotide reductase R2 mRNA: role in message stability.;Ribonucleotide reductase is a highly regulated enzyme that provides the four deoxyribonucleotides required for DNA synthesis. Our studies showed that TGF-beta 1 treatment of BALB/c 3T3 mouse fibroblasts markedly elevated ribonucleotide reductase R2 mRNA levels, and also increased the half-life of R2 message by 4-fold from 1.5 h in untreated cells to 6 h in treated cells. We describe a novel 75 Kd sequence-specific cytoplasmic factor (p75) that binds selectively to a 83-nucleotide 3'-untranslated region of R2 mRNA and did not bind to the 5'UTR, the coding region of the R2 message or to the 3'UTRs of other mRNAs (from c-myc, GM-CSF and the iron responsive element from the transferrin receptor mRNA), or to the homopolymer poly(A) sequence. p75-RNA binding activity, which requires new protein synthesis, is not present in untreated cells, but is induced following TGF-beta 1 stimulation. The in vivo kinetics of appearance of p75 binding activity paralleled the accumulation of R2 mRNA. Insertion of the 3'-untranslated region into the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) message confers TGF-beta 1 induced stability of RNA in stably transfected cells, while the same insert carrying a deletion of the 83-nucleotide fragment had little affect on RNA levels. Furthermore, in vitro decay reactions that contained the 83-nucleotide RNA or deletion of this fragment caused a significant decrease in TGF-beta 1 stabilization of R2 message. A model is presented of R2 message regulation in which TGF-beta 1 mediated stabilization of R2 message involves a specific interaction of a p75-trans-acting factor with a cis-element(s) stability determinant within the 83-nucleotide sequence which is linked to a reduction in the rate of R2 mRNA degradation.; polyalanine ;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

This protein is involved in various post-transcriptional regulations, such as mRNA stabilization and translational regulation. In this study, the full-length mouse α-CP2 gene was expressed in an insoluble form with an N-terminal histidine tag in Escherichia coli and purified for homogeneity using affinity column chromatography. Its identity was confirmed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Recombinant α-CP2 was expressed and refolded. The protein folding conditions for denatured α-CP2 were optimized. DNA and RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that the recombinant α-CP2 is capable of binding to both single-stranded DNA and RNA poly(C) sequences. Furthermore, plasmids expressing α-CP2 activated the expression of a luciferase reporter when co-transfected with a single-stranded (pGL-SS) construct containing a poly(C) sequence. To our knowledge, this study demonstrates for the first time that α-CP2 functions as a transcriptional activator by binding to a single-stranded poly(C) sequence. ;polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

217;8543151;A proline-rich TGF-beta-responsive transcriptional activator interacts with histone H3.;The molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of gene expression by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) have been analyzed. We show that TGF-beta specifically induces the activity of the proline-rich trans-activation domain of CTF-1, a member of the CTF/NF-I family of transcription factors. A TGF-beta-responsive domain (TRD) in the proline-rich transcriptional activation sequence of CTF-1 was shown to mediate TGF-beta induction in NIH-3T3 cells. Mutagenesis studies indicated that this domain is not the primary target of regulatory phosphorylations, suggesting that the growth factor may regulate a CTF-1-interacting protein. A two-hybrid screening assay identified a nucleosome component, histone H3, as a specific CTF-1-interacting protein in yeast. Furthermore, the CTF-1 trans-activation domain was shown to interact with histone H3 in both transiently and stably transfected mammalian cells. This interaction requires the TRD, and it appears to be upregulated by TGF-beta in vivo. Moreover, point mutations in the TRD that inhibit TGF-beta induction also reduce interaction with histone H3. In vitro, the trans-activation domain of CTF-1 specifically contacts histone H3 and oligomers of histones H3 and H4, and full-length CTF-1 was shown to alter the interaction of reconstituted nucleosomal cores with DNA. Thus, the growth factor-regulated trans-activation domain of CTF-1 can interact with chromatin components through histone H3. These findings suggest that such interactions may regulate chromatin dynamics in response to growth factor signaling.;polyproline;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
219;12743282;Binding of CCAAT displacement protein CDP to adenovirus packaging sequences.;Adenovirus (Ad) type 5 DNA packaging is initiated in a polar fashion from the left end of the genome. The packaging process is dependent upon the cis-acting packaging domain located between nucleotides 194 and 380. Seven A/T-rich repeats have been identified within this domain that direct packaging. A1, A2, A5, and A6 are the most important repeats functionally and share a bipartite sequence motif. Several lines of evidence suggest that there is a limiting trans-acting factor(s) that plays a role in packaging. Two cellular activities that bind to minimal packaging domains in vitro have been previously identified. These binding activities are P complex, an uncharacterized protein(s), and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF). In this work, we report that a third cellular protein, octamer-1 protein (Oct-1), binds to minimal packaging domains. In vitro binding analyses and in vivo packaging assays were used to examine the relevance of these DNA binding activities to Ad DNA packaging. The results of these experiments reveal that COUP-TF and Oct-1 binding does not play a functional role in Ad packaging, whereas P-complex binding directly correlates with packaging function. We demonstrate that P complex contains the cellular protein CCAAT displacement protein (CDP) and that full-length CDP is found in purified virus particles. In addition to cellular factors, previous evidence indicates that viral factors play a role in the initiation of viral DNA packaging. We propose that CDP, in conjunction with one or more viral proteins, binds to the packaging sequences of Ad to initiate the encapsidation process. ;polythreonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
220;9689579;Platelet adhesion and spreading on protein-coated surfaces: variations in behavior in washed cells, PRP, and whole blood.;Platelet attachment and spreading were monitored on glass and various protein coated glass, under shear with washed platelets, platelet rich plasma (PRP) and whole blood, using fluorescence Optimas imaging system and software. Results showed that the platelet adhesion and spreading were sensitive to the nature of precoated proteins and the type of medium used for introducing platelet suspension for the study. In general, the cell adhesion and spreading were higher with fibrinogen (Fg), fibronectin (Fn), von Willebrand Factor (vWF), and collagen precoated surfaces. In the presence of albumin on the surface, however, platelets could not attach and spread fully when using washed cells. But, the surface attachment and spreading of the cells were higher on albumin substrates on exposure to PRP or whole blood. This may be due to the replacement of precoated albumin by other plasma proteins, like Fg to facilitate the platelet-surface attachment. The composition of this layer determines the extent of platelet activation and the adhesive strength between platelets and polymer surface. These results indicate that multiple adhesion receptors can mediate platelet adhesion and spread to matrix proteins immobilized on surfaces. Further, these studies combined with some of our earlier observations and suggestions propose the need for developing in vitro tests that resemble in vivo conditions.;-;-;-;hard_0
221;7065258;Unstirred water layer in canine jejunum.;"The thickness of the unstirred water layer in in vivo-lavaged canine jejunum has been estimated by observations on the kinetics of entrance of [14C]inulin into the intervillus space (IVS) from the luminal fluid. Concentrations of the inulin in the IVS at three different levels (upper, 350 micrometers; middle, 250 micrometers; and lower, 250 micrometers) were determined as a function of duration of lavage. The concentrations rose slowly, indicating that there was little or no convective mixing of the fluid between the villi. After 1-2 h of lavage, mean concentrations in the IVS were three to seven times higher than in the lavage fluid, indicating that water absorption occurred from the IVS and that solvent drag as well as diffusion played a role in the entrance of inulin into the IVS. Because the concentration was always greatest at the uppermost level of the IVS, water absorption from the IVS must have been restricted to that level. Analysis of the data also required the inclusion of a small secretory stream (5% of the absorptive flow) from the crypts to explain the experimental observations. The results demonstrate that substances absorbed into the villus tips must penetrate an unstirred layer of 500-1,000 micrometers; for those absorbed into the lateral surfaces of the villi, an additional barrier of as much as 800 micrometers exists.";-;-;-;hard_0
222;35171288;High mobility group A3 enhances transcription of the DNA demethylase gene SlDML2 to promote tomato fruit ripening.;DNA methylation plays an important role in regulating tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) fruit ripening. Although SlDML2, a DNA demethylase (DML) gene, is critically involved in tomato fruit ripening, little is known about genes that regulate its expression. Using yeast one-hybrid screening, we identified a High Mobility Group A protein, named SlHMGA3, and demonstrated its binding activity to the AT-rich region of the SlDML2 promoter. We produced slhmga3 tomato mutants using CRISPR/Cas9 and observed that slhmga3 fruit reached the breaker stage much later than fruit from the wild-type. We further demonstrated that at the initiation stage of fruit ripening, the increased expression of SlDML2 and ethylene biosynthetic and signaling genes was significantly delayed in slhmga3 fruit, along with delays in ethylene production and demethylation and activation of ripening-associated transcription factor genes. Our results demonstrate that SlHMGA3 plays a role in enhancing SlDML2 expression, and its effects on tomato fruit ripening are largely through DNA demethylation of ripening-associated transcription factor genes.;polythreonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
225;6375898;Differential immunoadsorption coupled with rate nephelometry for estimation of DNA-binding immunoglobulins.;"We describe a technique for estimating the mass of anti-DNA antibodies by immunonephelometry of serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM) before and after adsorption onto DNA bound to agarose-polylysine columns. Sixteen patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and 16 age- and sex-matched controls were studied. Precision was determined for high-value (in 10 patients) and low-value (in nine controls) ranges for each of the immunoglobulins. Within-run CVs ranged from 3.0% (IgG, controls) to 11.8% (IgA, patients); between-run CVs ranged from 15.5% (IgG, patients) to 25.2% (IgM, patients). We found anti-DNA antibody concentrations (mean +/- SD) in systemic lupus erythematosus of 1.981 +/- 1.015 g/L for IgG (controls: 0.243 +/- 0.231, p less than 0.001), 0.257 +/- 0.215 g/L for IgA (controls: 0.038 +/- 0.035, p less than 0.001), and 0.282 +/- 0.234 g/L for IgM (controls: 0.191 +/- 0.165, p greater than 0.05). Sensitivity and linearity are such that fivefold dilutions of patients' serum with either a buffered albumin solution or control serum yielded values close to the expected values for IgG. Similarly diluted sera gave inordinately high values in the radiometric binding assay. Neither parametric (linear regression) nor nonparametric correlation methods (Spearman's rank and Kendall's tau) show a significant correlation between patients' data obtained by the present technique and that by a radiometric binding assay (p greater than 0.05), although combined data from patients and controls demonstrate a significant nonparametric correlation (p less than 0.005 for Spearman's and p less than 0.02 for Kendall's).";polylysine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
229;8798634;Effect of DNA-binding drugs on early growth response factor-1 and TATA box-binding protein complex formation with the herpes simplex virus latency promoter.;Adjacent binding sites for early growth response factor-1 (EGR1) and TATA box-binding protein (TBP) were identified on the herpes simplex virus latency promoter in previous work. The binding of EGR1 to the GC-rich region prevented TBP binding to the AT-rich region. With the simultaneous addition of both EGR1 and TBP, the intercalator nogalamycin prevented EGR1 complex formation, resulting in a dose-dependent increase of the TBP.DNA complex. The minor groove binder chromomycin A3 inhibited EGR1 complex formation but resulted in a smaller increase of the TBP complex. In contrast, an alkylating intercalator hedamycin strongly inhibited binding of both proteins. The ability of these GC-binding drugs to prevent EGR1.DNA complex formation was in the following order: hedamycin > nogalamycin > chromomycin A3, and the specificity was nogalamycin > chromomycin A3 > hedamycin. With transcription factor IIA (TFIIA) in the assay, TBP was able to bind the promoter whereas formation of the EGR1.DNA complex was reduced. An AT minor groove-binding drug, distamycin A, disrupted the TBP.TFIIA.DNA complex and restored the EGR1.DNA complex. We conclude that the binding motif and sequence preference of DNA-interactive drugs are manifested in their ability to inhibit the transcription factor-DNA complexes. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

A comparison with fetal blood gas analysis].;Pulsed Doppler ultrasonography was used to asses the pulsatility index (PI) on flow velocity waveforms in uterine, umbilical and fetal middle cerebral arteries from a total of 659 pregnancies and the standard curves of each PI in relation with the gestational age were obtained from a total of 472 normal pregnancies. Cordocentesis was performed on 20 patients (centesis group) of PIH (pregnancy-induced hypertension) complicated with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and fetal blood from the umbilical vein was sampled for blood gas analysis. Fetuses in the centesis group were acidemic (pH < 7.25) in 10 cases (50%), hypercapnemic (pCO2 > or = 50 mmHg) in 8 cases (40%), and hypoxemic (pO2 < 20 mmHg) in 6 cases (30%). In 13 cases (65%) in the centesis group, PI of the uterine artery (UTPI) was higher than +1.5 SD (standard division) of the standard curve (high UTPI), in 9 cases (45%) PI of the umbilical artery (UAPI) was higher than +1.5 SD of the standard curve (high UAPI), and in 10 cases (50%) PI of the middle cerebral artery (MCAPI) was lower than -1.5 SD of the standard curve (low MCAPI). All acidemic fetuses (100%) had high UTPI, 9 (90%) had high UAPI, and 8 (80%) had low MCAPI. All hypercapnemic fetuses had high UTPI, high UAPI and low MCAPI. All hypoxemic fetuses had high UTPI, high UAPI and low MCAPI. In the centesis group, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of high UTPI to fetal acidosis was 100%, 70%, 76.9% and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity and the specificity of high UAPI and low MCAPI to fetal acidosis was 80% and 100%, respectively. The positive predictive value was 100% and negative predictive value was 83.3%. From this study, we conclude that measurement of uterine and fetal blood flow waveforms by pulsed Doppler ultrasonography is useful to assess fetal well-being in IUGR caused by hypertension during pregnancy.;-;-;-;hard_0
242;8388654;Proximal tubular secretion of angiotensin II in rats.;It is now established that all of the components necessary for the local formation of angiotensin II (ANG II) coexist in the kidney and can alter local ANG II production rate. However, data on ANG II concentrations in different compartments within the kidney are limited. Recently, proximal tubule fluid ANG II concentrations in the nanomolar range were reported. Using an ANG II radioimmunoassay procedure with enhanced sensitivity, we performed experiments to explore proximal tubular fluid ANG II levels further and to determine the source of the ANG II. Total free-flow proximal tubular fluid samples (n = 11) had an average ANG II concentration of 13 +/- 2 nM. These concentrations were similar (10 +/- 2 nM) in samples collected into pipettes containing the inhibitors enalaprilat and EDTA (n = 17). Fluid collected from blocked proximal tubules that were perfused with artificial tubular fluid showed similar ANG II concentrations both in the presence (22 +/- 3 nM) and absence (22 +/- 4 nM) of the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, enalaprilat, in the perfusate. Plasma ANG II concentrations were much lower and averaged 155 +/- 26 pM. Isotonic saline expansion lowered plasma ANG II levels to 30 +/- 5 pM (P < 0.01) but did not significantly decrease intraluminal ANG II (8 +/- 1 nM). These data provide further evidence that intratubular ANG II concentrations are in the nanomolar range and are regulated independently of the plasma ANG II levels. The data obtained from perfused tubules indicate that the proximal tubule adds substantial amounts of ANG II or a precursor into the tubular lumen.;-;-;-;hard_0

TK-I and TK-II, insensitive to both EGF and insulin, have been further purified by Sephacryl S200 gel filtration and characterized. TK-I has an apparent mR of 65000, by far prefers Mn2+ over Mg2+ as activator, can use GTP besides ATP as phosphate donor and is stimulated 2-3-fold by polylysine. TK-II, whose mR approximates 50000, is equally activated by Mg2+ and Mn2+, does not use GTP and is insensitive to polylysine. TK-I and TK-II can phosphorylate the synthetic peptide Asp-Ala-Glu-Tyr-Ala-Ala-Arg-Arg-Arg-Gly (as well as its derivative with Orn in place of Arg), angiotensin II and poly(Glu, Tyr) 4:1 which exhibits different km values with TK-I and TK-II, (100 and 10 microM, respectively). When TK-I was incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP and MnCl2 a doublet of alkali-stable radiolabeled bands with molecular masses of 55 and 60 kDa were observed. Under identical conditions TK-II gives rise to a single alkali-stable radiolabeled band of 51 kDa, which may represent the autophosphorylation product of TK-II itself.;polylysine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function

252;6450274;Interstitial hyperosmolarity may cause axis cylinder shrinkage in streptozotocin diabetic nerve.;Maximal conduction velocity values of nerves of diabetic rats 20 weeks after streptozotocin intoxication were found to be intermediate between those of onset-control and those of end-control groups. The abnormality of conduction velocity of the streptozotocin group might therefore be attributed to a failure of maturation. Detailed electron microscopic morphometry of myelinated fibers (MFs) indicates that more than lack of maturation is involved. Whereas the number of lamellae and the perimeter of axis cylinders of myelinated fibers of the three study groups suggested that growth continues, cross-sectional area of the axis cylinders of the streptozotocin group was smaller than those of either control group. Scored evaluation of fiber shape and the measured index of circularity, which related perimeter and transverse axis cylinder area, also indicated that a selective shrinkage of axis cylinders had occurred. This selective alteration in size and shape of axis cylinders is identical to that described after hyperosmolar fixation. Compared with that of controls, the serum of streptozotocin rats is hyperosmolar. It would seem reasonable to attribute the axis cylinder changes to shrinkage. Whether an additional maturational effect is operative as well cannot be resolved from our data.;-;-;-;hard_0

CIM sulfoxide did ot inhibit the simultaneous renal tubular transport of p-aminohippuric acid or tetraethylammonium.

Clinical studies showed that 2 heterozygotes had a mild bleeding tendency, which presented as bleeding episodes after tooth extraction and after surgery and, in one patient, also as excessive menstruation. Laboratory investigations revealed an alpha 2-AP activity of 62% (51-71) (median and range) and an antigen level of 60% (60-66). The plasminogen binding as well as the fibrin binding properties of alpha 2-AP were normal. Plasminogen concentrations were significantly higher in the heterozygotes compared to the other family members. However, free plasminogen not bound to histidine-rich glycoprotein was not significantly different between these two groups. We propose that in this family the deficiency of alpha 2-AP is due to a decreased synthesis of a normal alpha 2-AP molecule. This present study brings the frequency of heterozygous alpha 2-AP deficient patients with a bleeding tendency to 13 out of 59 heterozygotes reported in the literature.;polyhistidine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
259;22612223;The G2385R variant of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 associated with Parkinson's disease is a partial loss-of-function mutation.;Autosomal-dominant missense mutations in LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2) are a common genetic cause of PD (Parkinson's disease). LRRK2 is a multidomain protein with kinase and GTPase activities. Dominant mutations are found in the domains that have these two enzyme activities, including the common G2019S mutation that increases kinase activity 2-3-fold. However, there is also a genetic variant in some populations, G2385R, that lies in a C-terminal WD40 domain of LRRK2 and acts as a risk factor for PD. In the present study we show that the G2385R mutation causes a partial loss of the kinase function of LRRK2 and deletion of the C-terminus completely abolishes kinase activity. This effect is strong enough to overcome the kinase-activating effects of the G2019S mutation in the kinase domain. Hsp90 (heat-shock protein of 90 kDa) has an increased affinity for the G2385R variant compared with WT (wild-type) LRRK2, and inhibition of the chaperone binding combined with proteasome inhibition leads to association of mutant LRRK2 with high molecular mass native fractions that probably represent proteasome degradation pathways. The loss-of-function of G2385R correlates with several cellular phenotypes that have been proposed to be kinase-dependent. These results suggest that the C-terminus of LRRK2 plays an important role in maintaining enzymatic function of the protein and that G2385R may be associated with PD in a way that is different from kinase-activating mutations. These results may be important in understanding the differing mechanism(s) by which mutations in LRRK2 act and may also have implications for therapeutic strategies for PD. ;polyleucine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function

We investigated  whether these genomic changes occur in the AR and PSA genes, which are usually  found in individuals with prostate cancer, of Turkish patients and to find out  their distribution in the population. We used PCR and PCR-RFLP assays for AR  and PSA genes, respectively, to detect molecular changes in 44 prostate cancer  patients. Our findings indicate that individuals with prostate cancer tend to  have around 18 CAG trinucleotide repeats. We observed significant differences  between 22 controls, 33 benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) patients and 44  adenocarcinoma patients for long CAG repeats. However, we did not find any  significant differences in GGC repeats between controls, BPH and adenocarcinoma  patients (P = 0.408). We also did not observe significant differences in the  PSA A/G polymorphism frequency between controls, BPH and adenocarcinoma  patients (P = 0.483).

Minicollagen-1, the best characterized member of this protein family so far, consists of a central collagen triple helix of 12 nm in length flanked at both ends by a polyproline stretch and a conserved cysteine-rich domain. The cysteine-rich tails are proposed to function in the assembly of soluble minicollagen trimers to high molecular structures by a switch of the disulfide linkage from intramolecular to intermolecular bonds. In this study, we investigate the trimeric nature of minicollagen-1 and its capacity to form disulfide-linked polymers in vitro. A fusion protein of minicollagen-1 with maltose-binding protein is secreted as a soluble trimer with only intrachain and no interchain disulfide bridges as confirmed by melting the collagen triple helix under reducing and non-reducing conditions. The conversion of minicollagen-1 trimers to monomers takes place between 40 and 55 degrees C with the melting point being approximately 45 degrees C. Oxidative reshuffling of the minicollagen-1 trimers leads to the formation of high molecular aggregates, which upon reduction show distinct polytrimeric states. Minicollagen trimers in isolated nematocyst capsules proved to be sensitive to SDS and were engaged in polymeric structures with additional cross-links that were resistant to reducing agent. ;polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function
273;8590015;Structure of full-length porcine synovial collagenase reveals a C-terminal domain containing a calcium-linked, four-bladed beta-propeller.;The collagenases are members of the family of zinc-dependent enzymes known as the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). They are the only proteinases that specifically cleave the collagen triple helix, and are important in a large number of physiological and pathological processes. Structures are known for the N-terminal catalytic' domain of collagenases MMP-1 and MMP-8 and of stromelysin (MMP-3). This catalytic domain alone, which comprises about 150 amino acids, has no activity against collagen. A second domain, of 200 amino acids, is homologous to haemopexin, a haem-binding glycoprotein. The crystal structure of full-length MMP-1 at 2.5 A resolution gives an R-factor of 21.7%. Two domains are connected by an exposed proline-rich linker of 17 amino acids, which is probably flexible and has no secondary structure. The catalytic domain resembles those previously observed, and contains three calcium-binding sites. The haemopexin-like domain contains four units of four-stranded antiparallel beta sheet stabilized on its fourfold axis by a cation, which is probably calcium. The domain constitutes a four-bladed beta-propeller structure in which the blades are scarcely twisted. The exposed linker accounts for the difficulty in purifying full-length collagenase. The C-terminal domain provides a structural model for haemopexin and its homologues. It controls the specificity of MMPs, affecting both substrate and inhibitor binding, although its role remains obscure. These structural results should aid the design of site-specific mutants which will reveal further details of the specificity mechanism. ;polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function

To evaluate how using a wheelchair with rear-wheel camber (when the bottoms of the wheels are farther apart than the tops) is associated with the risk of instability incidents, and to determine the effect of camber on wheelchair stability.


DESIGN, SETTING, PATIENTS
Epidemiologic data were analyzed from a sample of 576 users of manually propelled wheelchairs in Nova Scotia. A controlled trial was performed using a representative wheelchair occupied by an anthropomorphic test dummy, altering the camber in 5 degrees increments from -15 degrees to +15 degrees.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
For the epidemiologic study, univariate and multivariate analyses were used. To measure the static stability, a tilting platform was used according to the guidelines of the International Organization for Standardization.


RESULTS
Camber users reported significantly more instability incidents; of these incidents, more were in the rear direction (40% vs 27%) and fewer in the lateral direction (17% vs 28%) (p < .01). When controlling for other factors, camber was associated with a 3.91-fold increased risk of sustaining an instability incident (p < .001). With increases in camber angle in the laboratory, lateral and forward stability increased and rear stability decreased (with the wheels unlocked and locked) (p < .001).


CONCLUSION
Camber use is negatively associated with instability incidents in the lateral direction and positively associated with incidents in the backward direction, probably due in part to the effects of camber on lateral and rear stability.";-;-;-;hard_0

The sequence of a 226-bp MRP cDNA clone showed that a region close to the C terminus of MRP is identical to a sequence found in the cDNA-encoding proliferin (PLF). PLF, cloned from Balb/c 3T3 cells, is a member of the prolactin/growth-hormone family. Here we show that MRP and PLF are also antigenically identical. Antiserum raised against purified MRP specifically immunoprecipitated PLF secreted by CV-1 cells that had been transfected with PLF cDNA in an SV40 vector. Also, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) specifically increased the amount of PLF poly(A)+ RNA in Swiss 3T3 cells. We have previously shown that FGF increases the amount of MRP and MRP mRNA synthesized by the same cells. The anti-MRP antiserum recognized both unglycosylated and glycosylated forms of MRP and PLF. The unglycosylated and glycosylated forms of PLF had the same Mr values as those of the unglycosylated (21,500) and glycosylated (34,000) forms of MRP. However, the anti-MRP antiserum did not recognize mouse prolactin and anti-mouse prolactin antibody did not recognize MRP. Evidently, MRP/PLF is an immunologically distinct member of the prolactin/growth-hormone family of secreted, intercellular regulators. ;polyalanine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
279;12393192;Analysis of binding sites for the nitrogen-control transcription factor NtcA in the promoters of Synechococcus nitrogen-regulated genes.;Dissociation constant (K(d)) was determined for the binding of the transcriptional regulator NtcA to a number of NtcA-activated promoters of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942, as well as to mutant versions of those promoters altered in their NtcA-binding sites. K(d) values obtained ranged from 27 nM for the NtcA-binding site in the glnA promoter to ca. 1.4 microM for the site in the glnB promoter. Changes in the sequence signature of NtcA-binding sites (i.e. GTAN(8)TAC) either completely prevented binding of NtcA or drastically decreased its affinity for the promoter revealing that the GTN(10)AC subset is essential for binding. The importance of the flanking A/T-rich sequences and of a conserved CA dimer found in between the GTA/TAC triplets was also stressed. Thus, this structure seems to be optimal for the binding of NtcA. Comparison of K(d) values for NtcA binding to native promoters showed that differences in the sequence of their NtcA binding sites determine extensive differences in the affinity of the regulator for those sites. ;polythreonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
281;14638778;Intestinal antilectin immunoglobulin A antibody response and immunity to Entamoeba dispar infection following cure of amebic liver abscess.;"We followed 93 subjects with amebic liver abscess (ALA) and 963 close associate controls at 3-month intervals for 36 months to characterize intestinal and humoral antibody responses to the amebic galactose-inhibitable lectin and to determine whether immunity developed to Entamoeba histolytica or Entamoeba dispar infection following cure of ALA. We found that ALA subjects had a higher prevalence and level of intestinal antilectin immunoglobulin A (IgA) and serum anti-LC3 (cysteine-rich recombinant lectin protein) IgA and IgG antibodies, P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively, compared to controls. The intestinal antilectin IgA antibody response was sustained over a longer time period in ALA subjects (71.8% remained positive at 18 months and 52.6% at 36 months, P < 0.001 compared to 17.6% and 10.3% of controls, respectively). ALA subjects were highly immune to E. dispar infection throughout the study (0% infected at 6 and 36 months, compared to 6.5% and 4.9% of control subjects, respectively, P < 0.05). Upon entry into the study, 6.3% of ALA subjects were infected with E. histolytica; the incidence of new E. histolytica infections in controls (as determined by culture) was too low (1.4%) to determine whether ALA subjects exhibited immunity to new infections. We found that stool cultures every 3 months markedly underestimated the occurrence of new E. histolytica infections, as 15.3% of controls seroconverted after 12 months of follow-up. Unfortunately, under the field conditions present in Durban, South Africa, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of lectin antigen in stool yielded unreliable results. In summary, subjects cured of ALA exhibited sustained mucosal IgA antibody responses to the amebic galactose-inhibitable lectin and a high level of immunity to E. dispar infection. Determination of immunity to E. histolytica following cure of ALA will require the use of more sensitive and reliable diagnostic methods. ";polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

Using 8 chromatographic steps, we achieved a 6700-fold purification of an enzymatically active protein with a molecular weight of approximately 90 kDa. Under denaturing conditions the protein split into 2 components which migrated at 45 and 50 kDa in SDS-PAGE, suggesting that the native enzyme is a heterodimer. The purified enzyme was characterized in terms of physicochemical and kinetic properties, and substrate specificity. It was specific for histone H4, leading to acetylation of non-acetylated H4 subspecies into the di-acetylated state in vitro. Its activity was coincident with the intensity of DNA replication in meristematic cells during embryo germination. We established an electrophoretic system under non-denaturing conditions for detection of enzyme activity within the gel matrix; in combination with second dimension SDS-PAGE the procedure allowed the unambiguous identification of histone acetyltransferase, even in crude enzyme preparations.";-;-;-;hard_0

286;8732995;Molecular basis of androgen insensitivity.;Male sexual differentiation and development proceed under direct control of androgens. Androgen action is mediated by the intracellular androgen receptor, which belongs to the superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors. In the X-linked androgen insensitivity syndrome, defects in the androgen receptor gene have prevented the normal development of both internal and external male structures in 46, XY individuals. The complete form of androgen insensitivity syndrome is characterized by 46, XY karyotype, external female phenotype, intra-abdominal testes, absence of uterus and ovaries, blindly ending vagina, and gynecomastia. There is also a group of disorders of androgen action that result from partial impairment of androgen receptor function. Clinical indications can be abnormal sexual development of individuals with a predominant male phenotype with severe hypospadias and micropenis or of individuals with a predominantly female phenotype with cliteromegaly, ambiguous genitalia, and gynecomastia. Complete or gross deletions of the androgen receptor gene have not been frequently found in persons with the complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, whereas point mutations at several different sites in exons 2-8 encoding the DNA- and androgen-binding domain have been reported in both partial and complete forms of androgen insensitivity, with a relatively high number of mutations in two clusters in exons 5 and 7. The number of mutations in exon 1 is extremely low, and no mutations have been reported in the hinge region, located between the DNA-binding domain and the ligand-binding domain. The X-linked condition of spinal and bulbar muscle atrophy (Kennedy's disease) is characterized by a progressive motor neuron degeneration associated with signs of androgen insensitivity and infertility. The molecular cause of spinal and bulbar muscle atrophy is an expanded length (> 40 residues) of one of the polyglutamine stretches in the N-terminal domain of the androgen receptor. ;polyglutamine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
287;30735725;Plastid phylogenomic insights into the evolution of Caryophyllales.;The Caryophyllales includes 40 families and 12,500 species, representing a large and diverse clade of angiosperms. Collectively, members of the clade grow on all continents and in all terrestrial biomes and often occupy extreme habitats (e.g., xeric, salty). The order is characterized by many taxa with unusual adaptations including carnivory, halophytism, and multiple origins of C4 photosynthesis. However, deep phylogenetic relationships within the order have long been problematic due to putative rapid divergence. To resolve the deep-level relationships of Caryophyllales, we performed phylogenomic analyses of all 40 families of Caryophyllales. We time-calibrated the molecular phylogeny of this clade, and evaluated putative correlations among plastid structural changes and rates of molecular substitution. We recovered a well-resolved and well-supported phylogeny of the Caryophyllales that was largely congruent with previous estimates of this order. Our results provide improved support for the phylogenetic position of several key families within this clade. The crown age of Caryophyllales was estimated at ca. 114.4 million years ago (Ma), with periods of rapid divergence in the mid-Cretaceous. A strong, positive correlation between nucleotide substitution rate and plastid structural changes was detected. Our study highlights the importance of broad taxon sampling in phylogenomic inference and provides a firm basis for future investigations of molecular, morphological, and ecophysiological evolution in Caryophyllales.;-;-;-;hard_0
291;7766824;Conformational properties of the proline region of porcine neuropeptide Y by CD and 1H-nmr spectroscopy.;"We synthesized porcine neuropeptide Y (pNPY) N-terminal fragments by solid-phase synthesis techniques and analyzed them for solution conformational properties by CD and 1H-nmr spectroscopy. The analogues pNPY1-9 and pNPY1-14 displayed CD spectra indicative of random structures and showed no evidence for induced alpha-helical structures in trifluoroethanol (TFE) up to 50%. However, the CD spectra of pNPY1-9 suggested a conformational shift in tetrahydrofuran. Although in aqueous solution the CD spectra of pNPY1-21 indicated random structures with induction of only a small percentage of alpha-helix in aqueous TFE, pNPY1-25 displayed 13% alpha-helical structure in aqueous solution that increased to 40 and 41% by the addition of TFE and methanol, respectively. The nmr spectra of pNPY1-9 and the proline region of pNPY1-25 indicated extended structures with all-trans conformers at Pro5 and Pro8 for pNPY1-9 and at Pro5, Pro8, and Pro13 for pNPY1-25; in each case the Tyr1-Pro2 amide bond was in both cis and trans conformations. However, observed nuclear Overhauser effect correlations and HN exchange experiments indicated an alpha-helical segment in pNPY1-25 initiated by Pro13 and extending from residues 14 to 25. Thus, the N-terminal polyproline region of NPY has no propensity to fold into a regular secondary structure, although Pro13 is a helix initiator, a result consistent with the proposed role of this amino acid in the NPY structural model.

292;9251783;Does TATA matter? A structural exploration of the selectivity determinants in its complexes with TATA box-binding protein.;The binding of the TATA box-binding protein (TBP) to a TATA sequence in DNA is essential for eukaryotic basal transcription. TBP binds in the minor groove of DNA, causing a large distortion of the DNA helix. Given the apparent stereochemical equivalence of AT and TA basepairs in the minor groove, DNA deformability must play a significant role in binding site selection, because not all AT-rich sequences are bound effectively by TBP. To gain insight into the precise role that the properties of the TATA sequence have in determining the specificity of the DNA substrates of TBP, the solution structure and dynamics of seven DNA dodecamers have been studied by using molecular dynamics simulations. The analysis of the structural properties of basepair steps in these TATA sequences suggests a reason for the preference for alternating pyrimidine-purine (YR) sequences, but indicates that these properties cannot be the sole determinant of the sequence specificity of TBP. Rather, recognition depends on the interplay between the inherent deformability of the DNA and steric complementarity at the molecular interface.;polythreonine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
293;9584240;Radial keratotomy learning curve using the American technique.;"PURPOSE
To delineate the learning curve for a beginning refractive surgeon using the centrifugal (American) technique.


SETTING
Naval Medical Center, San Diego, California, USA.


METHODS
The first 100 radial keratotomy (RK) cases (51 patients) of one surgeon, divided into five sequential groups of 20, were retrospectively reviewed. All patients had RK using the American technique. Emmetropia was the goal in all patients. Groups were compared with respect to preoperative refractive status, age, sex, and outcome. Outcomes analysis included visual acuity, refractive error, complications, and enhancement rates. Data were reviewed preoperatively and 1 and 3 months postoperatively.


RESULTS
All five groups were age and sex matched. There was no difference in preoperative refractive error among the five groups. Sequential improvement in early postoperative refractive error from a mean of -1.73 diopters (D) +/- 1.00 (SD) (first 20) to 0.45 +/- 0.55 D (last 20) (P < .001) and decreased enhancement rates from 50% (first 20) to 0% (last 20) (P = .002) were statistically significant. Visual acuity at 1 month was 20/40 or better in 47% of patients in Group 1 (first 20), whereas all patients in Group 5 (last 20) had an acuity better than 20/40 (P < .001). There was no significant difference in complication rates among the five groups.


CONCLUSION
The results of RK using the American technique can improve significantly with surgeon experience. Enhancement rates decreased with experience, and there was no difference in complication rates during the learning period of one surgeon.";-;-;-;hard_0
297;8242555;Gene expression of insulin-like growth factor II in human intracranial meningioma.;"BACKGROUND
Insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) is synthesized in the normal brain of adult humans predominantly in the choroid plexus and meninges and is secreted in the cerebrospinal fluid. The authors measured IGF-II transcripts and peptides in biopsy specimens from human intracranial tumors including astrocytomas, glioblastomas, and meningiomas.


METHODS
The presence of IGF-II mRNA was analyzed in 12 human brain tumors by Northern analysis of total RNA extracted from tumor biopsies and by in situ hybridization of tissue sections. The amount of immunoreactive IGF-II was determined by radioimmunoassay of tumor extracts.


RESULTS
Northern analysis of RNA from four meningiomas showed IGF-II mRNA of 6.0, 4.8, and 2.2 kb, and in situ hybridization revealed that meningioma tumor cells contained IGF-II mRNA. In contrast, biopsy specimens from four astrocytomas, one oligoastrocytoma, and four glioblastomas showed no IGF-II mRNA. Radioimmunoassay of IGF-II in tumor extracts showed that all tumors contained IGF-II (40-160 ng/g tissue). Two meningiomas contained the highest amounts of IGF-II (144 and 160 ng/g tissue).


CONCLUSIONS
IGF-II mRNA is present in higher amounts in benign meningiomas than in malignant glioblastomas and astrocytomas, whereas the content of immunoreactive IGF-II is similar. On the basis of these findings, the authors believe that IGF-II may be involved in growth regulation of meningiomas.";-;-;-;hard_0

302;12853460;Trichohyalin mechanically strengthens the hair follicle: multiple cross-bridging roles in the inner root shealth.;Trichohyalin is expressed in specialized epithelia that are unusually mechanically strong, such as the inner root sheath cells of the hair follicle. We have previously shown that trichohyalin is sequentially subjected to post-synthetic modifications by peptidylarginine deaminases, which convert many of its arginines to citrullines, and by transglutaminases, which introduce intra- and interprotein chain cross-links. Here we have characterized in detail the proteins to which it becomes cross-linked in vivo in the inner root sheath of the mouse hair follicle. We suggest that it has three principal roles. First, it serves as an interfilamentous matrix protein by becoming cross-linked both to itself and to the head and tail end domains of the inner root sheath keratin intermediate filament chains. A new antibody reveals that arginines of the tail domains of the keratins are modified to citrullines before cross-linking, which clarifies previous studies. Second, trichohyalin serves as a cross-bridging reinforcement protein of the cornified cell envelope of the inner root sheath cells by becoming cross-linked to several known or novel barrier proteins, including involucrin, small proline-rich proteins, repetin, and epiplakin. Third, it coordinates linkage between the keratin filaments and cell envelope to form a seamless continuum. Together, our new data document that trichohyalin is a multi-functional cross-bridging protein that functions in the inner root sheath and perhaps in other specialized epithelial tissues by conferring to and coordinating mechanical strength between their peripheral cell envelope barrier structures and their cytoplasmic keratin filament networks. ;polyproline;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
303;9605114;Cutting edge: signals from the B lymphocyte antigen receptor regulate MHC class II containing late endosomes.;The B lymphocyte response to protein Ag is dependent upon the successful presentation to T cells of Ag-derived, MHC class II-restricted peptides. The B cell Ag receptor (BCR) facilitates this process by internalizing ligand and delivering it to specialized compartment(s) (MHC class II peptide-loading compartments (MIIC)) where it is processed into peptides and loaded onto MHC class II. In addition to efficiently targeting Ag, the BCR can provide tyrosine kinase-dependent signals that augment the presentation of Ag, possibly by enhancing the generation of immunogenic peptides. However, the mechanism by which this occurs is unclear. Herein, we report that the BCR signals a reorganization, fusion, and acidification of an MHC-like compartment into an invariant chain- and MHC class II-rich complex of large vesicles. This complex becomes the primary target for endocytosed receptors. These data suggest that signals generated by the BCR regulate the site of Ag processing.;polyisoleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

307;12386162;Zinc is required for assembly and function of the anti-trp RNA-binding attenuation protein, AT.;"The anti-TRAP protein (AT) of Bacillus subtilis regulates expression of the trp operon and other genes concerned with tryptophan metabolism. AT acts by inhibiting the tryptophan-activated trp RNA-binding attenuation protein (TRAP). AT is an oligomer of identical 53-residue polypeptides; it is produced in response to the accumulation of uncharged tRNA(Trp). Each AT polypeptide has two cysteine-rich clusters that correspond to the signature motif of the cysteine-rich zinc-binding domain of the chaperone protein DnaJ. Here we characterize the putative zinc-binding domain of AT and establish the importance of zinc for AT assembly and activity. AT is shown to contain Zn(II) at a ratio of one ion per monomer. Bound zinc is necessary for maintenance of the quaternary structure of AT; the removal of zinc converts the AT complex into inactive monomers. All four cysteine residues in the AT polypeptide are involved in Zn(II) coordination. Chemical cross-linking analyses indicate that the AT functional oligomer is a hexamer composed of two trimers. Substituting alanine for any cysteine residue of AT results in rapid degradation of the mutant protein in vivo. We propose a model for the AT trimer in which three AT chains are held together by three zinc atoms, each coordinated by the N-terminal segment and the C-terminal segment of separate AT polypeptides.

309;12775575;von Willebrand factor but not alpha-thrombin binding to platelet glycoprotein Ibalpha is influenced by the HPA-2 polymorphism.;Glycoprotein (GP) Ibalpha is the functionally dominant subunit of the platelet GPIb-IX-V receptor complex. The N-terminal domain of the GPIbalpha chain contains binding sites for alpha-thrombin and von Willebrand factor (VWF). The human platelet alloantigen (HPA)-2 polymorphism of the GPIbalpha gene is associated with a C/T transition at nucleotide 1018, resulting in a Thr/Met dimorphism at residue 145 of GPIbalpha. To study the structural and functional effects of this dimorphism, N-terminal fragments (AA1-289) of the HPA-2a and HPA-2b alloform of GPIbalpha expressed in CHO cells were used. Of 74 moAbs directed against human GPIbalpha, 2 antibodies with epitope between AA1-59 could differentiate between both alloforms. In addition, VWF bound with a higher affinity to the recombinant HPA-2a fragment or to homozygous HPA-2a platelets. In contrast, no difference was found in the binding of alpha-thrombin to the recombinant alloform fragments or of antibodies directed against the alpha-thrombin binding anionic sulfated tyrosine sequence (AA269-282). Whereas the Thr145Met dimorphism does not affect alpha-thrombin binding, it does influence the conformation of the N-terminal flanking region and first leucine-rich repeat of GPIbalpha and by this has an effect on VWF binding. ;polyleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

317;9173886;Sequence-selective binding to DNA of bis(amidinophenoxy)alkanes related to propamidine and pentamidine.;The DNA sequences targeted by a complete homologous series of aromatic diamidines have been determined at single-nucleotide resolution via protection from cutting by the endonucleases DNase I, DNase II and micrococcal nuclease. Propamidine, pentamidine and to a lesser extent hexamidine bind selectively to nucleotide sequences composed of at least four consecutive A-T base pairs. In contrast, the binding to DNA of butamidine, heptamidine, octamidine and nonamidine is poorly sequence-selective. Sequences composed of only three consecutive A-T base pairs do not afford a potential binding site for propamidine or the longer homologues, and none of the drugs tolerate the presence of a G-C base pair within the binding site. Experiments with DNA molecules containing inosine in place of guanosine and 2,6-diaminopurine in place of adenine reveal that the lack of binding of propamidine to GC-containing sites is attributable to an obstructive effect of the exocyclic 2-amino group of guanosine. The present data support the view that the local conformation of the double helix (in particular the width of the minor groove) plays a dominant role in the binding reaction and that the capacity of diamidines to recognize AT-rich sequences selectively varies considerably depending on the length of the alkyl chain. The evidence indicates that binding to AT-tracts in DNA must play a role in the biological activity of these diamidines, but there is no simple correlation between binding and pharmacological efficacy. ;polythreonine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
319;33169049;A Computational Model to Predict Consumer Behaviour During COVID-19 Pandemic.;The knowledge-based economy has drawn increasing attention recently, particularly in online shopping applications where all the transactions and consumer opinions are logged. Machine learning methods could be used to extract implicit knowledge from the logs. Industries and businesses use the knowledge to better understand the consumer behavior, and opportunities and threats correspondingly. The outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has a great impact on the different aspects of our daily life, in particular, on our shopping behaviour. To predict electronic consumer behaviour could be of valuable help for managers in government, supply chain and retail industry. Although, before coronavirus pandemic we have experienced online shopping, during the disease the number of online shopping increased dramatically. Due to high speed transmission of COVID-19, we have to observe personal and social health issues such as social distancing and staying at home. These issues have direct effect on consumer behaviour in online shopping. In this paper, a prediction model is proposed to anticipate the consumers behaviour using machine learning methods. Five individual classifiers, and their ensembles with Bagging and Boosting are examined on the dataset collected from an online shopping site. The results indicate the model constructed using decision tree ensembles with Bagging achieved the best prediction of consumer behavior with the accuracy of 95.3%.

320;19142648;LRRK2 and neurodegeneration.;Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 gene (PARK8/LRRK2) encoding the protein Lrrk2 are causative of inherited and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) with phenotypic manifestations of frontotemporal lobar degeneration, corticobasal degeneration and associated motor neuron disease in some patients, and with variable penetrance. Neuropathology is characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta in all cases with accompanying Lewy pathology, or tau pathology or without intraneuronal inclusions, thus indicating that mutations in LRRK2 are not always manifested as Lewy body disease (LBD) or as alpha-synucleinopathy. Molecular studies have not disclosed clear association between nerve cell degeneration and modifications in the kinase activity of Lrrk2, and the pathogenesis of LRRK2 mutations remains unknown. Several morphological studies have suggested that Lrrk2 is a component of Lewy bodies and aberrant neurites in sporadic PD and Dementia with Lewy bodies, whereas other studies have indicated that Lrrk2 does not participate in Lewy body composition. Likewise, some studies have shown Lrrk2 immunoreactivity in hyper-phosphorylated tau inclusions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies, whereas other studies did not find Lrrk2 in hyper-phosphorylated tau inclusions. We have used three currently used anti-Lrrk2 antibodies (NB-300-268, NB-300-267 and AP7099b) and concluded that these differences are largely dependent on the antibodies used and, particularly, on the interpretation of the origin of the multiple bands of low molecular weight species, in addition to the band corresponding to full-length Lrrk2, that recognize the majority of these antibodies. A review of the available data and our results indicate that full-length Lrrk2 is not a major component of Lewy bodies in LBDs, and of hyper-phosphorylated tau inclusions in AD and tauopathies. Bands of low molecular weight are probably not the result of post-mortem artefacts as they are also present in cultured cells processed under optimal conditions. Truncated forms of Lrrk2 and additional transcripts related with LRRK2, in the absence of spliced forms of Lrrk2 may account for Lrrk2 immunoreactivity in distinct intraneuronal inclusions. ;polyleucine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
321;8625077;Comparison of p53 gene abnormalities in bilateral and unilateral breast cancer.;"BACKGROUND
The results of recent studies have suggested that p53 gene abnormalities are associated with carcinogenesis in several neoplasms. It is believed that bilateral breast carcinomas develop as a result of a different carcinogenetic mechanism and genetic environment from those of unilateral lesions.


METHODS
p53 Gene abnormalities in bilateral primary breast cancer were detected by polymerase chain reaction-single strand comformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis. A total of 76 paraffin embedded tissue specimens from 38 patients with bilateral primary breast cancer were examined, and 62 patients with unilateral breast cancer were analyzed as control subjects. The bilateral tumors were defined as primary, based on clinical parameters and the presence of an intraductal component. There were 13 patients with synchronous bilateral breast cancer and 25 with metachronous bilateral breast cancer.


RESULTS
p53 Gene abnormalities were detected in 50% of the bilateral and 25.8% of the unilateral cases, and the difference was significant (P < 0.01, chi-square test). Abnormalities were detected in 56% of the metachronous cases, representing a much higher incidence than that of the unilateral cases (P < 0.001, chi-square test). The incidence of p53 gene abnormalities in the first and second tumors of the metachronous cases was 44% and 68%, respectively. The percentage of patients with a p53 gene abnormality and positive family history was higher for those with bilateral than with unilateral breast cancer (P < 0.01, chi-square test).

These findings indicate that the genetic changes and mechanism of carcinogenesis in bilateral and unilateral breast cancer are different.";-;-;-;hard_0
324;29086788;Why is surface diffusion the same in ultrastable, ordinary, aged, and ultrathin molecular glasses?;Recently Fakhraai and coworkers measured surface diffusion in ultrastable glass produced by vapor deposition, ordinary glass with and without physical aging, and ultrathin films of the same molecular glass-former, N,N'-bis(3-methylphenyl)-N,N'-diphenylbenzidine (TPD). Diffusion on the surfaces of all these glasses is greatly enhanced compared with the bulk diffusion similar to that previously found by others, but remarkably the surface diffusion coefficients DS measured are practically the same. The observed independence of DS from changes of structural α-relaxation due to densification or finite-size effect has an impact on the current understanding of the physical origin of enhanced surface diffusion. We have demonstrated before and also here that the primitive relaxation time τ0 of the coupling model, or its analogue τβ, the Johari-Goldstein β-relaxation, can explain quantitatively the enhancement found in ordinary glasses. In this paper, we assemble together considerable experimental evidence to show that the changes in τβ and τ0 of ultrastable glasses, aged ordinary glasses, and ultrathin-films are all insignificant when compared with ordinary glasses. Thus, in the context of the explanation of the enhanced surface diffusion given by the coupling model, these collective experimental facts on τβ and τ0 further explain approximately the same DS in the different glasses of TPD as found by Fakhraai and coworkers.;-;-;-;hard_0
325;8133125;Uridine: a marker of myocardial viability after coronary occlusion and reperfusion.;"Tissue accumulation of radiolabeled uridine, a precursor of uracil, reflects ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis and may be a marker of viability. To test this hypothesis, myocardial accumulation of H-3 uridine was compared to deoxyglucose uptake and histopathology in an experimental model of myocardial ischemia. In 18 Wistar rats the left coronary artery was occluded for 5, 10 or 60 minutes followed by reperfusion. Five hours later H-3 uridine and C-14 deoxyglucose were administered intravenously and the animals were sacrificed 45 minutes later. The left ventricle of each animal was divided into 12 segments and myocardial tracer accumulation was determined by measurement of tissue radioactivity. From the results of TTC staining, the animals were divided into 3 groups: Group I--ischemia without infarction (n = 9); Group II--non-transmural infarction (n = 4) and transmural infarction (n = 5). Retention of uridine was observed in ischemic zones with enhanced deoxyglucose accumulation in Group I animals. Uridine accumulation was relatively preserved compared to slightly decreased deoxyglucose accumulation in regions of non-transmural infarction in Group II. In Group III, uridine accumulation decreased in parallel with deoxyglucose in zones of infarction. These result suggest that accumulation of radiolabeled uridine may be a useful indicator of viability in ischemic myocardium.";-;-;-;hard_0
328;21461783;Different roles of the human Orc6 protein in the replication initiation process.;In eukaryotes, binding of the six-subunit origin recognition complex (ORC) to DNA provides an interactive platform for the sequential assembly of pre-replicative complexes. This process licenses replication origins competent for the subsequent initiation step. Here, we analyze the contribution of human Orc6, the smallest subunit of ORC, to DNA binding and pre-replicative complex formation. We show that Orc6 not only interacts with Orc1-Orc5 but also with the initiation factor Cdc6. Biochemical and imaging experiments reveal that this interaction is required for licensing DNA replication competent. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Orc6 contributes to the interaction of ORC with the chaperone protein HMGA1a (high mobility group protein A1a). Binding of human ORC to replication origins is not specified at the level of DNA sequence and the functional organization of origins is poorly understood. We have identified HMGA1a as one factor that might direct ORC to AT-rich heterochromatic regions. The systematic analysis of the interaction between ORC and HMGA1a revealed that Orc6 interacts with the acidic C-terminus of HMGA1a and also with its AT-hooks. Both domains support autonomous replication if targeted to DNA templates. As such, Orc6 functions at different stages of the replication initiation process. Orc6 can interact with ORC chaperone proteins such as HMGA1a to facilitate chromatin binding of ORC and is also an essential factor for pre-RC formation. ;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Morphological study of intracranial arteries based on animal experiments and human autopsies.;Artificial subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) produced by injection of autologous blood into the cisterna magna in dogs gave rise to considerable narrowing or spasm of the basilar artery and its branches, including the posterior cerebral arteries, as demonstrated by cerebral angiography. Repeated cisternal injections of blood at various intervals produced more severe spasm than a single injection. After perfusion-fixation of the brain, the cerebral arteries were examined by light and electron microscopy. None of the animals showed abnormalities in the intima or media of the vessel walls. Previously reported findings of morphological changes due to spasm could not be confirmed. Postmortem examination of brain vessels from nine patients with SAH and arterial spasm showed no specific changes that could be ascribed to spasm.;-;-;-;hard_0

333;8058765;Leucine-zipper dimerization motif encoded by the AF17 gene fused to ALL-1 (MLL) in acute leukemia.;Chromosome region 11q23 is involved in reciprocal chromosome translocations associated with human acute leukemias. These aberrations fuse the ALL-1 gene located at 11q23 to a series of partner genes positioned on a variety of human chromosomes. The fused genes encode chimeric proteins. Here we report the cloning and characterization of the ALL-1 partner at 17q21, the AF17 gene. The AF17 gene encodes a protein of 1093 amino acids, containing a leucine-zipper dimerization motif located 3' of the fusion point and a cysteine-rich domain at the N terminus. The latter can be arranged in three zinc fingers and shows homology to a domain within the protein Br140 (peregrin). AF17 contains stretches of amino acids previously associated with domains involved in transcriptional repression or activation. Based on features of AF17 and of the proteins encoded by the other partner genes analyzed and in conjunction with other recent studies, we propose a model in which ALL-1 rearrangements result in loss of function of the gene. In this model, the partner polypeptide plays an accessory role either by repressing activity of the truncated ALL-1 protein or by blocking the function of the normal protein presumably present in the leukemic cells.;polycysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function

335;27000303;Disrupted amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in antipsychotic-naïve adolescents with early-onset schizophrenia.;Evidence points to a crucial role for altered neural oscillations and synchrony in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Previous resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies found aberrant amplitudes of low-frequency oscillations in adult patients with schizophrenia. Whether the abnormality is also present in adolescents with early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) is largely unknown. We recruited 39 adolescents with a first episode of EOS and 31 age- and education- matched healthy controls. Resting state fMRI was obtained using an echo-planar imaging sequence. Voxel-wise amplitude of low-frequency (0.01-0.08Hz) fluctuations (ALFF) was compared between groups. We investigated seed-based functional connectivity between significantly disturbed ALFF regions and whole brain voxels in all participants. EOS participants exhibited significantly increased ALFF values in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and decreased ALFF in the ventral precuneus compared with controls. Decreased ALFF values in the precuneus of EOS showed a significant negative correlation with negative symptom scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Disturbed functional connectivity mainly occurred between the orbitofrontal cortex and the temporal cortex in EOS. These findings demonstrate abnormal spontaneous neuronal activity and functional connectivity in the frontal and parietal cortex of EOS. Aberrant ALFF in the precuneus might be a biomarker of EOS.;-;-;-;hard_0
338;8589628;Identification of a sequence-specific DNA binding factor required for transcription of the barley chloroplast blue light-responsive psbD-psbC promoter.;The plastid gene psbD encodes the photosystem II reaction center chlorophyll protein D2. psbD is located in a complex operon that includes psbC, psbK, psbl, orf62, and trnG. The operon is transcribed from at least three different promoters. One of the psbD promoters is differentially activated when plants are exposed to blue light. In this study, the psbD blue light-responsive promoter was accurately transcribed in vitro in high-salt extracts of barley plastids. Transcription required supercoiled templates and was inhibited by tagetitoxin, an inhibitor of plastid transcription. Escherichia coli RNA polymerase did not recognize the psbD light-responsive promoter with the same specificity as plastid RNA polymerase. Deletion analyses demonstrated that sequences between -39 and -68, upstream of the transcription initiation site, were required for transcription of the psbD blue light-responsive promoter. This DNA region is highly conserved among plant species and contains multiple AAG sequences. Gel shift assays and DNase I footprinting experiments demonstrated that the AAG-rich DNA sequence interacts with a sequence-specific DNA binding factor termed AGF. Point mutations in the AAG cis element decreased binding of AGF and inhibited transcription from the psbD light-responsive promoter. We concluded that AGF is an essential factor required for transcription of the psbD light-responsive promoter. ;polyglycine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
344;35867748;The ZCCHC14/TENT4 complex is required for hepatitis A virus RNA synthesis.;Despite excellent vaccines, resurgent outbreaks of hepatitis A have caused thousands of hospitalizations and hundreds of deaths within the United States in recent years. There is no effective antiviral therapy for hepatitis A, and many aspects of the hepatitis A virus (HAV) replication cycle remain to be elucidated. Replication requires the zinc finger protein ZCCHC14 and noncanonical TENT4 poly(A) polymerases with which it associates, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that ZCCHC14 and TENT4A/B are required for viral RNA synthesis following translation of the viral genome in infected cells. Cross-linking immunoprecipitation sequencing (CLIP-seq) experiments revealed that ZCCHC14 binds a small stem-loop in the HAV 5' untranslated RNA possessing a Smaug recognition-like pentaloop to which it recruits TENT4. TENT4 polymerases lengthen and stabilize the 3' poly(A) tails of some cellular and viral mRNAs, but the chemical inhibition of TENT4A/B with the dihydroquinolizinone RG7834 had no impact on the length of the HAV 3' poly(A) tail, stability of HAV RNA, or cap-independent translation of the viral genome. By contrast, RG7834 inhibited the incorporation of 5-ethynyl uridine into nascent HAV RNA, indicating that TENT4A/B function in viral RNA synthesis. Consistent with potent in vitro antiviral activity against HAV (IC50 6.11 nM), orally administered RG7834 completely blocked HAV infection in Ifnar1 mice, and sharply reduced serum alanine aminotransferase activities, hepatocyte apoptosis, and intrahepatic inflammatory cell infiltrates in mice with acute hepatitis A. These results reveal requirements for ZCCHC14-TENT4A/B in hepatovirus RNA synthesis, and suggest that TENT4A/B inhibitors may be useful for preventing or treating hepatitis A in humans.;polyalanine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
347;3024702;Nucleotide sequence and nuclease hypersensitivity of the Chinese hamster dihydrofolate reductase gene promoter region.;We have sequenced the 1240 base pairs (bp) upstream from the translation start site of the hamster dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene. The DNA in the 5' flanking region contains several elements that are homologous in both sequence and relative location to corresponding elements in the human and murine DHFR genes: an 11-bp element adjacent to the ATG codon, a 19-bp element that coincides with the major transcription start site, and two 29-bp upstream elements that are represented 4 times in the murine DHFR gene but only once in the human gene. Two clusters of short, G/C-rich elements conforming to the consensus binding sequence for the transcription factor Spl are located in the upstream region in all three genes. The symmetrical placement of the G/C boxes coincides with a symmetrical DNase I hypersensitive pattern in the chromatin, suggesting that the Spl protein may be involved in maintaining chromatin structure in this region.;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
348;17902047;MAZ drives tumor-specific expression of PPAR gamma 1 in breast cancer cells.;The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 1 (PPARgamma1) is a nuclear receptor that plays a pivotal role in breast cancer and is highly over-expressed relative to normal epithelia. We have previously reported that the expression of PPARgamma1 is mediated by at least six distinct promoters and expression in breast cancer is driven by a tumor-specific promoter (pA1). Deletional analysis of this promoter fragment revealed that the GC-rich, 263 bp sequence proximal to the start of exon A1, is sufficient to drive expression in breast cancer cells but not in normal, human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC). By combining the disparate technologies of microarray and computer-based transcription factor binding site analyses on this promoter sequence the myc-associated zinc finger protein (MAZ) was identified as a candidate transcription factor mediating tumor-specific expression. Western blot analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays verify that MAZ is overexpressed in MCF-7 cells and is capable of binding to the 263 bp promoter fragment, respectively. Furthermore, the over-expression of MAZ in HMEC is sufficient to drive the expression of PPARgamma1 and does so by recruiting the tumor-specific promoter. This results in an increase in the amount of PPARgamma1 capable of binding to its DNA response element. These findings help to define the molecular mechanism driving the high expression of PPARgamma1 in breast cancer and raise new questions regarding the role of MAZ in cancer progression. ;polycysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
349;25342468;Transformer 2β and miR-204 regulate apoptosis through competitive binding to 3' UTR of BCL2 mRNA.;RNA-binding proteins and microRNAs are potent post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. Human transformer 2β (Tra2β) is a serine/arginine-rich-like protein splicing factor and is now implicated to have wide-ranging roles in gene expression as an RNA-binding protein. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) with an anti-Tra2β antibody and microarray analysis identified a subset of Tra2β-associated mRNAs in HCT116 human colon cancer cells, many of which encoded cell death-related proteins including Bcl-2 (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2). Tra2β knockdown in HCT116 cells decreased Bcl-2 expression and induced apoptosis. Tra2β knockdown accelerated the decay of BCL2α mRNA that encodes Bcl-2 and full-length 3' UTR, while it did not affect the stability of BCL2β mRNA having a short, alternatively spliced 3' UTR different from BCL2α 3' UTR. RIP assays with anti-Tra2β and anti-Argonaute 2 antibodies, respectively, showed that Tra2β bound to BCL2α 3' UTR, and that Tra2β knockdown facilitated association of miR-204 with BCL2α 3' UTR. The consensus sequence (GAA) for Tra2β-binding lies within the miR-204-binding site of BCL2 3' UTR. Mutation of the consensus sequence canceled the binding of Tra2β to BCL2 3' UTR without disrupting miR-204-binding to BCL2 3' UTR. Transfection of an anti-miR-204 or introduction of three-point mutations into the miR-204-binding site increased BCL2 mRNA and Bcl-2 protein levels. Inversely, transfection of precursor miR-204 reduced their levels. Experiments with Tra2β-silenced or overexpressed cells revealed that Tra2β antagonized the effects of miR-204 and upregulated Bcl-2 expression. Furthermore, TRA2β mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in 22 colon cancer tissues compared with paired normal tissues and positively correlated with BCL2 mRNA expression. Tra2β knockdown in human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549) increased their sensitivity to anticancer drugs. Taken together, our findings suggest that Tra2β regulates apoptosis by modulating Bcl-2 expression through its competition with miR-204. This novel function may have a crucial role in tumor growth.  ;polyarginine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
353;28472517;The RNA binding protein Npl3 promotes resection of DNA double-strand breaks by regulating the levels of Exo1.;Eukaryotic cells preserve genome integrity upon DNA damage by activating a signaling network that promotes DNA repair and controls cell cycle progression. One of the most severe DNA damage is the DNA double-strand break (DSB), whose 5΄ ends can be nucleolitically resected by multiple nucleases to create 3΄-ended single-stranded DNA tails that trigger DSB repair by homologous recombination. Here, we identify the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA binding protein Npl3 as a new player in DSB resection. Npl3 is related to both the metazoan serine-arginine-rich and the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleo-proteins. NPL3 deletion impairs the generation of long ssDNA tails at the DSB ends, whereas it does not exacerbate the resection defect of exo1Δ cells. Furthermore, either the lack of Npl3 or the inactivation of its RNA-binding domains causes decrease of the exonuclease Exo1 protein levels as well as generation of unusual and extended EXO1 RNA species. These findings, together with the observation that EXO1 overexpression partially suppresses the resection defect of npl3Δ cells, indicate that Npl3 participates in DSB resection by promoting the proper biogenesis of EXO1 mRNA. ;polyarginine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
355;2115645;The rhombotin gene belongs to a class of transcriptional regulators with a potential novel protein dimerisation motif.;The derived protein sequence of the presumptive oncogene rhombotin is virtually identical between human and mouse (Boehm et al., 1990), rendering it difficult to identify functionally important regions or motifs. We have therefore sought to isolate and compare rhombotin sequences from disparate species. Here we show that a sequence which is highly homologous to that of human and mouse rhombotin exists in Drosophila DNA. Comparison of the sequences shows the main conserved feature to be a cysteine-rich region (CRR). The mammalian rhombotin gene has tandemly duplicated CRR's (CRR-1 and CRR-2) and comparison of CRR-1 and -2 with other known proteins shows close homology to the proposed LIM domains of the nematode cell lineage proteins lin-11 and mec-3 (Freyd et al., 1990), and of a vertebrate transcription factor (Isl-1) (Karlsson et al., 1990). The latter three proteins share a homeodomain, in addition to the LIM domains. These observations suggest that the LIM domain might facilitate protein-protein interactions in a manner analogous to the leucine zipper or the helix-loop-helix motifs. Thus, since rhombotin lacks a DNA-binding homeodomain, this protein might belong to a new class of transcriptional regulators which modulate transcription via intermolecular competitive binding to the LIM domains of certain DNA-binding transcription factors. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
359;21463505;High recombination rates and hotspots in a Plasmodium falciparum genetic cross.;The human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum survives pressures from the host immune system and antimalarial drugs by modifying its genome. Genetic recombination and nucleotide substitution are the two major mechanisms that the parasite employs to generate genome diversity. A better understanding of these mechanisms may provide important information for studying parasite evolution, immune evasion and drug resistance. Here, we used a high-density tiling array to estimate the genetic recombination rate among 32 progeny of a P. falciparum genetic cross (7G8 × GB4). We detected 638 recombination events and constructed a high-resolution genetic map. Comparing genetic and physical maps, we obtained an overall recombination rate of 9.6 kb per centimorgan and identified 54 candidate recombination hotspots. Similar to centromeres in other organisms, the sequences of P. falciparum centromeres are found in chromosome regions largely devoid of recombination activity. Motifs enriched in hotspots were also identified, including a 12-bp G/C-rich motif with 3-bp periodicity that may interact with a protein containing 11 predicted zinc finger arrays. These results show that the P. falciparum genome has a high recombination rate, although it also follows the overall rule of meiosis in eukaryotes with an average of approximately one crossover per chromosome per meiosis. GC-rich repetitive motifs identified in the hotspot sequences may play a role in the high recombination rate observed. The lack of recombination activity in centromeric regions is consistent with the observations of reduced recombination near the centromeres of other organisms. ;polycysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
360;7853596;Isolation of genes differentially expressed at the downstream anastomosis of prosthetic arterial grafts with use of mRNA differential display.;"PURPOSE
Downstream anastomotic intimal hyperplasia in prosthetic arterial grafts remains a major cause of delayed graft failure. The new method of messenger RNA (mRNA) differential display was used to screen numerous genes to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of intimal hyperplasia.


METHODS
Fifty-centimeter-long 8 mm expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts were placed in four mongrel dogs from the carotid artery to the distal abdominal aorta. At 3 months the distal anastomoses and adjacent normal aortas were harvested; a portion was taken for histologic examination, and total RNA was isolated from the remainder. Differential mRNA display was used to identify candidate cDNA clones whose expression differed in anastomotic intimal hyperplasia as compared with adjacent unaffected aorta. The clones were sequenced, and national gene databases were searched. Northern blot analysis confirmed alteration of gene expression.


RESULTS
Approximately 5000 mRNA species were screened, and 11 candidate clones were obtained. DNA sequence revealed homology of five clones to known gene sequences. Homologous genes included an interferon-gamma-induced human gene, (IGUP I-5111), alpha-1 protease inhibitor gene, human retinoblastoma susceptibility gene, and human creatine kinase gene (two clones). Northern blot analysis revealed altered gene expression in 4 of 11, nonregulation in 1 of 11, and undetectable signals in 6 of 11. Expression of the clone representing IGUP I-5111 in the segment of intimal hyperplasia was found to be decreased over threefold to only 31% +/- 16.4% SE of the level seen in normal aorta.


CONCLUSIONS
The technique of mRNA differential display has identified differences in gene expression in an in vivo model of anastomotic intimal hyperplasia. Expression of RNA with homology to an interferon-gamma-induced human gene was consistently decreased within the hyperplastic region at the downstream polytetrafluoroethylene arterial anastomosis.";-;-;-;hard_0
363;1706644;Deposition of extracellular matrix along the pathways of migrating fibroblasts.;"Fibroblasts from rat, mouse and chick embryos cultured on poly-lysine/fibronectin- or poly-lysine/laminin-coated dishes were stained with antibodies directed to extracellular matrix molecules. The staining showed that cells had migrated during culture and deposited extracellular matrix components along their migration trails. Depending on the antigen, the staining of the matrix revealed fibrils, spots or a diffuse smear along the migration pathways. The major matrix components were fibronectin and heparan sulfate proteoglycan; however, laminin nidogen, tenascin, glia-derived nexin (GDN) and chondroitin-4-sulfate proteoglycan were also found. The migration trails were also detectable by scanning electron microscopy. Here, the fibrils were the prominent structures. The deposition of matrix was independent from the substratum: fibronectin was deposited on laminin, plain poly-lysine, basal lamina and even on fibronectin. Functional assays using anti-fibronectin or an antiserum to embryonic pigment epithelium basement membrane disturbed the formation of matrix fibrils, but did not inhibit cell attachment and translocation. Likewise, heparin in the culture medium only partially inhibited cell migration, despite the fact that it disturbed the formation of proper matrix fibrils. Our results suggest that the deposition of extracellular matrix by cells may not be mandatory for attachment and translocation. However, the deposition of matrix along defined trails might be important for the pathfinding of cells or nerve fibers that appear later in development. ";polylysine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
368;28369425;The β-reducing end in α(2-8)-polysialic acid constitutes a unique structural motif.;Over the years, structural characterizations of α(2-8)-polysialic acid (polySia) in solution have produced inconclusive results. Efforts for obtaining detailed information in this important antigen have focused primarily on the α-linked residues and not on the distinctive characteristics of the terminal ones. The thermodynamically preferred anomeric configuration for the reducing end of sialic acids is β, which has the [I]CO2- group equatorial and the OH ([I]OH2) axial, while for all other residues the CO2- group is axial. We show that this purportedly minor difference has distinct consequences for the structure of α(2-8)-polySia near the reducing end, as the β configuration places the [I]OH2 in a favorable position for the formation of a hydrogen bond with the carboxylate group of the following residue ([II]CO2-). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations predicted the hydrogen bond, which we subsequently directly detected by NMR. The combination of MD and residual dipolar couplings shows that the net result for the structure of Sia2-βOH is a stable conformation with well-defined hydration and charge patterns, and consistent with experimental NOE-based hydroxyl and aliphatic inter-proton distances. Moreover, we provide evidence that this distinct conformation is preserved on Sia oligosaccharides, thus constituting a motif that determines the structure and dynamics of α(2-8)-polySia for at least the first two residues of the polymer. We suggest the hypothesis that this structural motif sheds light on a longtime puzzling observation for the requirement of 10 residues of α(2-8)-polySia in order to bind effectively to specific antibodies, about four units more than for analogous cases. ;polyserine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

Epitope mapping was performed on solid phase matrices. 25.7% (116/451) SSc sera were anti-BICD2 positive, of which 19.0% had single specificity anti-BICD2 and 81.0% had other autoantibodies, notably anti-CENP (83/94; 88.3%). Compared to anti-BICD2 negative subjects (335/451), single specificity anti-BICD2 subjects were more likely to have an inflammatory myopathy (IM; 31.8% vs. 9.6%, p=.004) and interstitial lung disease (ILD; 52.4% vs. 29.0%, p=.024). Epitope mapping revealed a serine- and proline-rich nonapeptide SPSPGSSLP comprising amino acids 606-614 of BICD2, shared with CENP-A but not CENP-B. We observed that autoantibodies to BICD2 represent a new biomarker as they were detected in patients without other SSc-specific autoantibodies and were the second most common autoantibody identified in this SSc cohort. Our data indicate that the major cross-reactive epitope is associated with anti-CENP-A but, unlike anti-CENP, single specificity anti-BICD2 antibodies associate with ILD and IM.

This conclusion is based on the following observations: the late origin binding protein has a molecular mass of about 100 kDa, like factor Oct1, and shares other biochemical properties with Oct1; its binding to the origin is inhibited by antibodies directed against the POU domain of factor Oct1; the isolated POU domain of Oct1 specifically binds to the SV40 late origin region. Thus, the SV40 genome contains binding sites for transcription factor Oct1 in the origin of replication in addition to the previously characterized octamer sites in the viral promoter enhancer. Oct1, bound to the viral origin, negatively affects the DNA unwinding reaction catalyzed by the viral replication initiator T antigen, suggesting that Oct1 may have a role in the regulation of viral replication.

In Experiment I bright letters on a black background were used instead of black letters on bright background used in previous experiments. Such change of brightness within the stimuli did not influence the character of interactions between letters. This suggests that the positive interactions are connected with higher level of visual system. In Experiment II patients with damage of various areas of the brain cortex were tested. The facilitation between two letters did not occur in patients with prestriate lesions, although it can be observed in patients with different localization of lesions. This suggests that prestriate cortex is involved in positive interactions between letters.;-;-;-;hard_0
382;22426400;Huntingtin with an expanded polyglutamine repeat affects the Jab1-p27(Kip1) pathway.;Expansion of polyglutamine repeats is the cause of at least nine inherited human neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington's disease (HD). It is widely accepted that deregulation of the transcriptional coactivator CBP by expanded huntingtin (htt) plays an important role in HD molecular pathogenesis. In this study, we report on a novel target of expanded polyglutamine stretches, the transcriptional coactivator Jun activation domain-binding protein 1 (Jab1), which shares DNA-sequence-specific transcription factor targets with CBP. Jab1 also plays a major role in the degradation of the cyclin-dependent-kinase inhibitor and putative transcription cofactor p27(Kip1). We found that Jab1 accumulates in aggregates when co-expressed with either expanded polyglutamine stretches or N-terminal fragments of mutant htt. In addition, the coactivator function of Jab1 was suppressed both by aggregated expanded polyglutamine solely and by mutant htt. Inhibition by mutant htt even preceded the appearance of microscopic aggregation. In an exon 1 HD cell model, we found that endogenous Jab1 could be recruited into aggregates and that this was accompanied by the accumulation of p27(Kip1). Accumulation of p27(Kip1) was also found in brains derived from HD patients. The repression of Jab1 by various mechanisms coupled with an increase of p27(Kip1) at late stages may have important transcriptional effects. In addition, the interference with the Jab1-p27(Kip1) pathway may contribute to the observed lower incidence of cancer in HD patients and may also be relevant for the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of polyglutamine disorders in general. ;polyglutamine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
384;7768595;Evidence for the presence of collagenous domains in Candida albicans cell surface proteins.;Rabbit polyclonal antibodies (PAbs) directed towards the amino-terminal cysteine-rich 7S domain (PAb anti-7S), the major internal collagenous domain (PAb anti-type IV), and the C-terminal noncollagenous region (PAb anti-NC1) of the type IV collagen molecule were probed by indirect immunofluorescence against Candida albicans blastoconidia and germinated blastoconidia. Most nongerminating cells and mother blastoconidia from which germ tubes originated showed strong fluorescence when PAb anti-7S was used, whereas with PAb anti-type IV, fluorescence was found almost exclusively on the surface of filamentous forms. A patched fluorescent pattern rather than a homogenous confluent fluorescence was observed in all cases. No fluorescent cells were observed with PAb anti-NC1. By Western immunoblotting, PAb anti-type IV cross-reacted primarily with a polypeptide of 37 kDa present in wall extracts obtained from intact cells of both growth forms by treatment with beta-mercaptoethanol, whereas PAb anti-7S recognized a major 58-kDa antigen also present in both extracts, along with some other high-molecular-mass (> 106-kDa) polydisperse species present only in the material released from blastoconidia with beta-mercaptoethanol. No reactive bands were observed when PAb anti-NC1 was used as a probe in Western immunoblotting experiments. The sensitivities or resistances to collagenase digestion of the different polypeptides that cross-reacted with PAbs anti-type IV and anti-7S suggest the existence of cell wall components in C. albicans that contain epitopes that mimic the collagenous domains of the type IV collagen molecule.;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
389;29884945;Long-Term Plasticity at the Mitral and Tufted Cell to Granule Cell Synapse of the Olfactory Bulb Investigated with a Custom Multielectrode in Acute Brain Slice Preparations.;"Single extracellular stimulation electrodes are a widespread means to locally activate synaptic inputs in acute brain slices. Here we describe the fabrication and application of a multielectrode stimulator that was developed for conditions under which independent stimulation of several nearby sites is desirable. For the construction of the multielectrode we have developed a method by which electrode wires can be spaced at minimal distances of 100 μm. This configuration increases the efficiency of stimulation paradigms, such as the comparison of proximal induced and control inputs for studies of synaptic plasticity.In our case the multielectrode was used for acute olfactory bulb slices to independently excite individual nearby glomeruli; the technique allowed us to demonstrate homosynaptic bidirectional long-term plasticity at the mitral/tufted cell to granule cell synapse. We also describe the determinants for successful recordings of long-term plasticity at this synapse, with mechanical and electrophysiological recording stability being tantamount. Finally, we briefly discuss data analysis procedures.";-;-;-;hard_0
394;12949087;Mycobacterium tuberculosis FurA autoregulates its own expression.;The furA-katG region of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, encoding a Fur-like protein and the catalase-peroxidase, is highly conserved among mycobacteria. Both genes are induced upon oxidative stress. In this work we analyzed the M. tuberculosis furA promoter region. DNA fragments were cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene, and promoter activity in Mycobacterium smegmatis was measured in both the presence and absence of oxidative stress. The shortest fragment containing an inducible promoter extends 45 bp upstream of furA. In this region, -35 and -10 promoter consensus sequences can be identified, as well as a 23-bp AT-rich sequence that is conserved in the nonpathogenic but closely related M. smegmatis. M. tuberculosis FurA was purified and found to bind upstream of furA by gel shift analysis. A ca. 30-bp DNA sequence, centered on the AT-rich region, was essential for FurA binding and protected by FurA in footprinting analysis. Peroxide treatment of FurA abolished DNA binding. Three different AT-rich sequences mutagenized by site-directed mutagenesis were constructed. In each mutant, both M. tuberculosis FurA binding in vitro and pfurA regulation upon oxidative-stress in M. smegmatis were abolished. Thus, pfurA is an oxidative stress-responsive promoter controlled by the FurA protein. ;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
396;18328328;Mutations in cytochrome b that affect kinetics of the electron transfer reactions at center N in the yeast cytochrome bc1 complex.;We have examined the pre-steady-state kinetics and thermodynamic properties of the b hemes in variants of the yeast cytochrome bc1 complex that have mutations in the quinone reductase site (center N). Trp-30 is a highly conserved residue, forming a hydrogen bond with the propionate on the high potential b heme (bH heme). The substitution by a cysteine (W30C) lowers the redox potential of the heme and an apparent consequence is a lower rate of electron transfer between quinol and heme at center N. Leu-198 is also in close proximity to the b(H) heme and a L198F mutation alters the spectral properties of the heme but has only minor effects on its redox properties or the electron transfer kinetics at center N. Substitution of Met-221 by glutamine or glutamate results in the loss of a hydrophobic interaction that stabilizes the quinone ligands. Ser-20 and Gln-22 form a hydrogen-bonding network that includes His-202, one of the carbonyl groups of the ubiquinone ring, and an active-site water. A S20T mutation has long-range structural effects on center P and thermodynamic effects on both b hemes. The other mutations (M221E, M221Q, Q22E and Q22T) do not affect the ubiquinol oxidation kinetics at center P, but do modify the electron transfer reactions at center N to various extents. The pre-steady reduction kinetics suggest that these mutations alter the binding of quinone ligands at center N, possibly by widening the binding pocket and thus increasing the distance between the substrate and the bH heme. These results show that one can distinguish between the contribution of structural and thermodynamic factors to center N function.;-;-;-;hard_0
402;9278482;The transcriptional activation and repression domains of RFX1, a context-dependent regulator, can mutually neutralize their activities.;EP is a DNA element found in regulatory regions of viral and cellular genes. While being a key functional element in viral enhancers, EP has no intrinsic enhancer activity but can stimulate or silence transcription in a context-dependent manner. The EP element is bound by RFX1, which belongs to a novel, evolutionarily conserved protein family. In an attempt to decipher the mechanism by which EP regulates transcription, the intrinsic transcriptional activity of RFX1 was investigated. A functional dissection of RFX1, by analysis of deletion mutants and chimeric proteins, identified several regions with independent transcriptional activity. An activation domain containing a glutamine-rich region is found in the N-terminal half of RFX1, while a region with repressor activity overlaps the C-terminal dimerization domain. In RFX1 these activities were mutually neutralized, producing a nearly inactive transcription factor. This neutralization effect was reproduced by fusing RFX1 sequences to a heterologous DNA-binding domain. We propose that relief of self-neutralization may allow RFX1 to act as a dual-function regulator via its activation and repression domains, accounting for the context-dependent activity of EP. ;polyglutamine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
404;7918637;Characterization of an Krox-24/Egr-1-responsive element in the human tumor necrosis factor promoter.;We have analyzed in various human leukemic cell lines a previously unrecognized region within the human TNF gene promoter that contains the sequence motif 5'-CCGCCCCCGCG-3'. This GC-rich sequence maps to bps -170 and -160 of the TNF gene. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) combined with methylation interference analysis revealed the binding of two distinct proteins with overlapping recognition sites. Supershift assays identified the constitutive transcription factor Sp1 and the immediate-early growth-response transcription factor Egr-1/Krox-24. Interestingly, this Egr-1-related factor was induced by PMA but not by TNF. The TNF gene GC-rich sequence conferred PMA responsiveness when linked to a heterologous minimal c-fos promoter. To examine the involvement of Egr-1/Krox-24 in TNF gene regulation, a Krox-24 expression vector was used, pSCTKr24. In Jurkat T cells pSCTKr24 stimulated pTNF-286CAT that contains sequences -286 to +34 of the human TNF gene fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. Moreover, pSCTKr24 also stimulated the TNF gene GC-rich sequence linked to the minimal c-fos promoter. However, deletion of this site did not result in markedly reduced TNF promoter activity, suggesting that the Egr-1/Krox-24 response element may play an auxiliary role in TNF gene regulation.;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
410;12359720;Characterization of a novel mammalian Groucho isoform and its role in transcriptional regulation.;The Wnt/beta-catenin/Tcf pathway serves important functions in embryonic development and is constitutively activated in human colorectal cancer. The nuclear output of Wnt signaling is mediated by a complex between DNA-binding proteins of the TCF family and the transcriptional coactivator beta-catenin. Groucho proteins act to repress transcriptional activation by beta-catenin-Tcf complexes, probably by interacting directly with Tcf transcription factors. We have identified several splice forms of the mouse Groucho Grg1 gene expressed in the developing intestine. Prominent among these is a novel and abundant isoform, Grg1-S, which we characterize in this report. Grg1-S has highest homology with the TLE family of large Groucho proteins but features only the amino-terminal Q and glycine- and proline-rich domains typical of the Groucho/AES subfamily. Grg1-S is expressed in development and in several adult mouse tissues. Expression in the adult small intestine is highest at the base of the crypts of Lieberkuhn. Grg1-S acts to antagonize beta-catenin activity in Xenopus axis duplication and luciferase reporter assays in mammalian cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that Grg1-S may operate in conjunction with beta-catenin and Tcf factors to regulate vertebrate gut epithelial cell differentiation. ;polyproline;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
414;11714925;Antifreeze protein from shorthorn sculpin: identification of the ice-binding surface.;Shorthorn sculpins, Myoxocephalus scorpius, are protected from freezing in icy seawater by alanine-rich, alpha-helical antifreeze proteins (AFPs). The major serum isoform (SS-8) has been reisolated and analyzed to establish its correct sequence. Over most of its length, this 42 amino acid protein is predicted to be an amphipathic alpha-helix with one face entirely composed of Ala residues. The other side of the helix, which is more heterogeneous and hydrophilic, contains several Lys. Computer simulations had suggested previously that these Lys residues were involved in binding of the peptide to the [11-20] plane of ice in the <-1102> direction. To test this hypothesis, a series of SS-8 variants were generated with single Ala to Lys substitutions at various points around the helix. All of the peptides retained significant alpha-helicity and remained as monomers in solution. Substitutions on the hydrophilic helix face at position 16, 19, or 22 had no obvious effect, but those on the adjacent Ala-rich surface at positions 17, 21, and 25 abolished antifreeze activity. These results, with support from our own modeling and docking studies, show that the helix interacts with the ice surface via the conserved alanine face, and lend support to the emerging idea that the interaction of fish AFPs with ice involves appreciable hydrophobic interactions. Furthermore, our modeling suggests a new N terminus cap structure, which helps to stabilize the helix, whereas the role of the lysines on the hydrophilic face may be to enhance solubility of the protein. ;polyalanine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
415;34335190;The Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis in Health and Disease and Its Implications for Translational Research.;Over the past decades, microbiome research has evolved rapidly and became a hot topic in basic, preclinical and clinical research, for the pharmaceutical industry and for the general public. With the help of new high-throughput sequencing technologies tremendous progress has been made in the characterization of host-microbiota interactions identifying the microbiome as a major factor shaping mammalian physiology. This development also led to the discovery of the gut-brain axis as the crucial connection between gut microbiota and the nervous system. Consequently, a rapidly growing body of evidence emerged suggesting that the commensal gut microbiota plays a vital role in brain physiology. Moreover, it became evident that the communication along this microbiota-gut-brain axis is bidirectional and primarily mediated by biologically active microbial molecules and metabolites. Further, intestinal dysbiosis leading to changes in the bidirectional relationship between gut microbiota and the nervous system was linked to the pathogenesis of several psychiatric and neurological disorders. Here, we discuss the impact of the gut microbiota on the brain in health and disease, specifically as regards to neuronal homeostasis, development and normal aging as well as their role in neurological diseases of the highest socioeconomic burden such as Alzheimer's disease and stroke. Subsequently, we utilize Alzheimer's disease and stroke to examine the translational research value of current mouse models in the spotlight of microbiome research. Finally, we propose future strategies on how we could conduct translational microbiome research in the field of neuroscience that may lead to the identification of novel treatments for human diseases.;-;-;-;hard_0
416;16464826;Transcriptional activators in yeast.;Eukaryotic transcription activation domains (ADs) are not well defined on the proteome scale. We systematicallly tested approximately 6000 yeast proteins for transcriptional activity using a yeast one-hybrid system and identified 451 transcriptional activators. We then determined their transcription activation strength using fusions to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and a His3 reporter gene which contained a promoter with a Gal4-binding site. Among the 132 strongest activators 32 are known transcription factors while another 35 have no known function. Although zinc fingers, helix-loop-helix domains and several other domains are highly overrepresented among the activators, only few contain characterized ADs. We also found some striking correlations: the stronger the activation activity, the more acidic, glutamine-rich, proline-rich or asparagine-rich the activators were. About 29% of the activators have been found previously to specifically interact with the transcription machinery, while 10% are known to be components of transcription regulatory complexes. Based on their transcriptional activity, localization and interaction patterns, at least six previously uncharacterized proteins are suggested to be bona fide transcriptional regulators (namely YFL049W, YJR070C, YDR520C, YGL066W/Sgf73, YKR064W and YCR082W/Ahc2). ;polyproline;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

The peptides exhibit a structural transition from the native alpha-helix state to entropically favored beta-sheet conformations, before eventually turning to extended coil at higher temperatures. Upon switching the electric field, the molecules undergo preferential alignment of their dipole moment vector toward the field axis and a shift of the alpha-beta transition to higher temperatures. At higher field strengths (>10(8) V/m) the molecules stretch and the alpha-beta and beta-coil transitions merge. A simple three-state model is shown to account for the observed behavior. Under even higher fields, density functional theory calculations and a polarizable force field both show that electronic rearrangements tend to further increase the dipole moment, polarization effects being approximately half in magnitude with respect to stretching effect. Finally a tentative (temperature, field-strength) phase diagram is sketched. ;polyalanine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
430;20637722;Structural contributions to the intracellular targeting strategies of antimicrobial peptides.;The interactions of cationic amphipathic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with anionic biological membranes have been the focus of much research aimed at improving the activity of such compounds in the search for therapeutic leads. However, many of these peptides are thought to have other polyanions, such as DNA or RNA, as their ultimate target. Here a combination of fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies has been used to assess the structural properties of amidated versions of buforin II, pleurocidin and magainin 2 that support their varying abilities to translocate through bacterial membranes and bind to double stranded DNA. Unlike magainin 2 amide, a prototypical membrane disruptive AMP, buforin II amide adopts a poorly helical structure in membranes closely mimicking the composition of Gram negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, and binds to a short duplex DNA sequence with high affinity, ultimately forming peptide-DNA condensates. The binding affinities of the peptides to duplex DNA are shown to be related to the structural changes that they induce. Furthermore, CD also reveals the conformation of the bound peptide buforin II amide. In contrast with a synthetic peptide, designed to adopt a perfect amphipathic alpha-helix, buforin II amide adopts an extended or polyproline II conformation when bound to DNA. These results show that an alpha-helix structure is not required for the DNA binding and condensation activity of buforin II amide. ;polyproline;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
431;9087554;Localization of ribosomal DNA in Rhagoletis pomonella (Diptera: Tephritidae) by in situ hybridization.;The ribosomal DNA (rDNA) of Rhagoletis pomonella was localized within both salivary gland polytene chromosomes and somatic cell mitotic chromosomes by in situ hybridization using the heterospecific Drosophila melanogaster rDNA clone, Dm238. In situ hybridization analysis of polytene nuclei showed that R. pomonella rDNA is located in the nucleolus and adjacent granular network of chromosome 1. The site of origin of rDNA is within this isomorphic granular network. The preservation of nucleolar ultrastructure in some polytene chromosome preparations allowed light microscope localization of R. pomonella rDNA to the apparent periphery of fibrillar centres within fibrillar complexes. In somatic cell nuclei, DM238 hybridized to the nucleolus organizing region (NOR) located on chromosome 1 at the site of the secondary constriction. The frequency distribution of heteromorphisms for rDNA content, differential appearance of secondary constrictions, non-pairing of the NOR and differences in homologue lengths suggests that the structural differentiation of this region in chromosome 1 is sex linked. This the first published description of the salivary gland polytene chromosomes from R. pomonella, and we include a tentative karyotype description, polytene chromosome maps and comments on their suitability for banding and molecular analysis.;-;-;-;hard_0

In this study we analyzed the main gangliosides of isolated glomeruli and cortical, medullary and papillary fractions of the human, rat and bovine kidneys biochemically. In addition, we used immunohistochemistry to visualize the distribution of GM1/GM2, GD2, GD3 and O-acetyl GD3 gangliosides along the nephron. Furthermore, we explored the species specific expression of gangliosides by comparing those from the rat, bovine and human kidney, and studied the pattern of ganglioside expression during development. In glomeruli, cortical tubuli, medullae and papillae, a relatively simple pattern of main gangliosides was observed as revealed by thin layer chromatographic (TLC) analysis in each species studied. Furthermore, considerable changes in the glomerular gangliosides during maturation were observed, with a complex type of gangliosides predominating during the fetal age and with a preference to more simple precursors upon maturation. Interestingly, the immunohistochemical detection revealed a distinct pattern of ganglioside compartmentation to various nephron segments or cell types. These findings provide a basis for studying the role of segment- and cell type-specific gangliosides for local functions.;-;-;-;hard_0

The rapid flow is completely blocked by ouabain, which has no effects on the slow basal flow. In the present experiment, we show that the vaso-constrictive hormone angiotensin II completely inhibits basal water absorption, but has no effect on rapid water absorption.

440;9034164;The role of serine/threonine phosphorylation in hematopoietic cytokine receptor signal transduction.;The hematopoietic cytokine receptors rapidly activate tyrosine phosphorylation after ligand engagement. In addition, however, serine/threonine phosphorylation of important effector molecules also icreases. Interleukins 2-5 and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor all activate protein kinase C. This results in serine/threonine phosphorylation of such important regulatory molecules as Raf-1 kinase, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate, and SOS. These phosphorylated effector molecules are regulators of important genes related to cell survival and proliferation. In addition, as yet uncharacterized serine/threonine kinases associate directly with the hematopoietic receptor subunits themselves. These kinases may contribute to the phosphorylation of the STAT family of transcription factors that is important in regulating cytokine-specific gene inductions. Thus, it is time to begin integrating serine/threonine kinases into the postulated signaling pathways activated by hematopoietic cytokine receptors.; polyalanine ;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
441;8761875;"[Internal urinary diversion in pelvic cancers and quality of life. Value of double ""J"" endoprosthesis].";The ureteral double pigtail stents are versatile and valued for proper urinary drainage in the setting of trauma, fistula formation, after extra-corporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and surgical manipulations of the upper urinary tract. Also they are used for prolonged urinary drainage in patients with chronic tumor-induced ureteral obstruction, and present an exceptional patient tolerance. The authors' experience is based upon 54 patients treated for ureteral obstruction of malignant origin between January 1989 and October 1995. Complications of this method as well as the quality of life of these patients are analysed and the results compared with those of the literature. The patient tolerance was excellent. Mean survival time after ureter catheterisation was 18 months. Complete urine diversion was achieved and hydronephrosis disappeared soon after stent placement in 42 patients (80%). In addition hydronephrosis persisted in 12 cases (20%), despite orthotopic positioning of the catheter and numerous stent changes for larger caliber stents. The palliative use of the double pigtail stent when no other treatment is possible for malignant ureteral obstruction, precludes the need for ureterostomy and offers the patient a comfortable quality of life. Bladder disease is a contraindication to the use of these catheters, although their insertion is rarely impossible. In case of acute obstruction, it is better to prepare the pathway with a standard ureteral catheter, which is easier to manage. It is always possible to insert the pigtail stent after some time has elapsed.;-;-;-;hard_0

Wilcoxon's rank sum test, chi square test, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used, 36 individuals with leukaemia and 14 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were followed for 158 weeks; mean age was 33 years (range 15-85). Oral lesion incidence rate was 45/100 patients-week. Exfoliative cheilitis and infections (herpes and candidosis) were the most common oral complications, followed by haemorrhagic lesions and mucositis. Haemorrhagic lesions correlated with thrombocytopenia (RR = 30.5). Etoposide administration (RR = 8.6), alkylating agents (RR = 15.6), a prior course of chemotherapy (RR = 23.2) and neutropenia (RR = 4.16) were predictors of mucositis.

445;8977316;Inducible nuclear factors binding the IgM heavy chain pre-mRNA secretory poly(A) site.;Two alternative forms of IgM heavy-chain mRNA are produced from a common precursor mRNA as a result of competition between cleavage/poly(A) addition at the upstream (secretory) poly(A) site and cleavage/poly(A) addition at the downstream (membrane) poly(A) site coupled with splicing. The efficiency of cleavage at the secretory poly(A) site is thought to play a crucial role in this alternative processing. We therefore examined RNA binding factors recognizing the secretory poly(A) site, in the absence of the splicing option, to look for transacting factors that may play a role in cleavage/polyadenylation efficiency at this site. Purified primary B cells produce the secretory form of mu mRNA when stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the membrane form of mu mRNA when their antigen receptors are ligated by anti-mu antibodies. We compared RNA binding factors in nuclear extracts from cells produced by these different stimulatory conditions and show that induction of the secretory form of mu mRNA by LPS correlates with the induction of a 28-32-kDa secretory poly(A) site-specific polypeptide which is also present in the plasmacytoma cell line J558L. Visualization of the 28-32-kDa polypeptide in UV cross-linking assays depends on a GU-rich element downstream of the secretory poly(A) site. We show that this GU-rich region enhances polyadenylation efficiency in vivo by transfection of luciferase reporter constructs into the plasmacytoma J558L. We also examined nuclear extracts from B cells doubly stimulated with LPS and anti-mu antibodies in which expression of the secretory form of mu mRNA is selectively inhibited. This inhibition may be due to a down-regulation of polyadenylation at the secretory poly(A) site or an up-regulation of the competitive splicing process. This form of stimulation does not lead to the disappearance of the 28-32-kDa polypeptide, but to an enhanced binding of a 50-55-kDa factor which binds both the secretory and membrane poly(A) site. We report the first detection of changes in RNA binding factors taking place at the secretory poly(A) site which correlate with the expression of different forms of mu mRNA produced by primary B cells under different stimulation conditions.; polyalanine ;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
447;7857874;Molecular modelling of the human estrogen receptor and ligand interactions based on site-directed mutagenesis and amino acid sequence homology.;A molecular model of the human estrogen receptor is reported based on a new alignment with the alpha 1-antitrypsin sequence, a homologous protein of known crystal structure. The putative ligand binding site is situated roughly equidistant between the DNA binding and dimerization regions. This binding site contains a number of amino acid residues shown by site-directed mutagenesis to be associated with the binding of agonists and antagonists. This putative ligand binding pocket is well-defined within a loop of peptide, containing complementary amino acids for binding interactions with agonists and antagonists. A leucine-rich region, common to most steroid-binding proteins, is in an optimum position for dimerization leading to DNA interaction. It is likely that ligand binding influences dimerization and DNA interaction by a conformational change in the receptor via the transcriptional activation residues. This model suggests that ligand binding may affect the hydrogen bonding pattern such that transpeptide signalling is initiated. The model accommodates steroidal estrogens and antiestrogens as well as the non-steroidal partial antagonist, hydroxytamoxifen.; polyleucine ;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
449;1716976;Glycine loops in proteins: their occurrence in certain intermediate filament chains, loricrins and single-stranded RNA binding proteins.;"Quasi-repetitive, glycine-rich peptide sequences are widespread in at least three distinct families of proteins: the keratins and other intermediate filament proteins, including nuclear lamins; loricrins, which are major envelope components of terminally differentiated epithelial cells; and single-stranded RNA binding proteins. We propose that such sequences comprise a new structural motif termed the 'glycine loop'. The defining characteristics of glycine loop sequences are: (1) they have the form x(y)n, where x is usually an aromatic or occasionally a long-chain aliphatic residue; y is usually glycine but may include polar residues such as serine, asparagine, arginine, cysteine, and rarely other residues; and the value of n is highly variable, ranging from 1 to 35 in examples identified to date. (2) Glycine-loop-containing domains are thought to form when at least two and to date, as many as 18, such quasi-repeats are configured in tandem, so that the entire domain in a protein may be 50-150 residues long. (3) The average value of n, the pattern of residues found in the x position and the non-glycine substitutions in the y position appear to be characteristic of a given glycine loop containing domain, whereas the actual number of repeats is less constrained. (4) Glycine loop sequences display a high degree of evolutionary sequence variability and even allelic variations among different individuals of the same vertebrate species. (5) Glycine loop sequences are expected to be highly flexible, but possess little other regular secondary structure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) ";polyglycine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

461;8458330;The functional versatility of CREM is determined by its modular structure.;The CREM gene (cAMP-responsive element modulator) generates both activators and repressors of cAMP-induced transcription by alternative splicing. We determined the exon structure of the CREM gene and have identified new isoforms. We show that CREM isoforms with different structural characteristics are generated by the shuffling of exons to produce proteins with various combinations of functional domains. CREM proteins bind efficiently to CREs and here we demonstrate that the various isoforms heterodimerize in vivo with each other and with CREB. The two alternative DNA binding domains of CREM, which are differentially spliced in the various isoforms, show distinct binding efficiencies, while CREM alpha/CREB heterodimers exhibit stronger binding than CREM beta/CREB heterodimers to a consensus CRE in vitro. We identify the protein domains involved in activation function and find that the phosphorylation domain and a single glutamine-rich domain are sufficient for activation. A minimal CREM repressor, containing only the b-Zip motif, efficiently antagonizes cAMP-induced transcription.

A cDNA encoding a 477-amino acid zinc finger protein designated MAZ (MYC-associated zinc finger protein) was cloned from a HeLa lambda gt11 library by screening with a concatamerized ME1a1 binding site probe. In addition to six potential zinc fingers of the Cys2His2 type, MAZ contains an amino-terminal proline-rich domain and several polyalanine tracts. Its mRNA was present in all human tissues tested except for kidney, as a doublet of approximately 2.5 and 2.7 kilobases, along with differentially expressed minor species. MAZ bound specifically to the wild-type ME1a1 sequence but not to a ME1a1 mutant that also failed to yield P2 activity. When expressed as a fusion protein in a pMAL-c vector, MAZ binds with specificity to a GA box sequence (GGGAGGG) found in the c-MYC P2 promoter, to the P2 attenuator region within the gene's first exon, and to a related sequence involved in the transcriptional termination of the C2 gene. MAZ may encode a transcription factor with dual roles in transcription initiation and termination.;polyproline;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
475;21435240;Secondary structure of protamine in sperm nuclei: an infrared spectroscopy study.;Protamines are small basic proteins that condense the DNA in mature spermatozoa. Typical protamines are of simple composition and very arginine-rich, usually in the range of 60-80%. Arginine residues are distributed in a number of stretches separated by neutral amino acids. We have used Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to gain access for the first time to the secondary structure of protamines in sperm nuclei. This technique is particularly well suited to the study of DNA-bound protamine in whole nuclei since it is not affected by turbidity. We show that DNA -bound salmon (salmine) and squid protamines contain α-helix, β-turns and a proportion of other structures not stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonding. No β-sheet was observed. In salmine, the α-helix amounted to ~20%, while in squid protamine it reached ~40%. In contrast, the structure not stabilized by intermolecular hydrogen bonding was more abundant in salmine (~40%) than in squid protamine (~20%). Both protamines contained ~40% β-turns. The different helical potential of salmine and squid protamine was confirmed by structure predictions and CD in the presence of trifluoroethanol. DNA-bound protamine in sperm nuclei contains large amounts of defined secondary structure stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Both salmine and squid protamine contain similar amounts of β-turns, but differ in the proportions of α-helix and non-hydrogen bonded conformations. In spite of the large differences in the proportions of secondary structure motifs between salmon and squid protamines, they appear to be equally efficient in promoting tight hexagonal packing of the DNA molecules in sperm nuclei. ;polyarginine;helix;-;LCR_with_function

In this paper we examine single mode quantum dot lasers under strong optical feedback conditions and show that an entirely new dynamical regime is found consisting of spontaneous mode-locking via a resonance between the relaxation oscillation frequency and the external cavity repetition rate. Experimental observations are supported by detailed numerical simulations of rate equations appropriate for this laser type.

Percutaneous pericardial drainage was effected with a 6 French pigtail catheter inserted via the subxyphoid approach. Catheter drainage was continued for 7 days in conjunction with systemic antibiotics. Catheter patency was maintained with antibiotic lavage. Immediate hemodynamic improvement followed the initial pericardial drainage. Fever, leukocytosis, and sepsis resolved during the course of therapy. The patient recovered fully from the closed space bacterial infection without additional surgical drainage. There has been no recurrence of streptococcal infection and no echocardiographic evidence of recurrent pericardial effusion after 3 months of follow-up. Indwelling catheter drainage combined with antibiotics may be an effective substitute for surgical drainage in the treatment of streptococcal pericarditis.;-;-;-;hard_0
487;26614673;Poly(A)-binding proteins and mRNA localization: who rules the roost?;RNA-binding proteins are often multifunctional, interact with a variety of protein partners and display complex localizations within cells. Mammalian cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) are multifunctional RNA-binding proteins that regulate multiple aspects of mRNA translation and stability. Although predominantly diffusely cytoplasmic at steady state, they shuttle through the nucleus and can be localized to a variety of cytoplasmic foci, including those associated with mRNA storage and localized translation. Intriguingly, PABP sub-cellular distribution can alter dramatically in response to cellular stress or viral infection, becoming predominantly nuclear and/or being enriched in induced cytoplasmic foci. However, relatively little is known about the mechanisms that govern this distribution/relocalization and in many cases PABP functions within specific sites remain unclear. Here we discuss the emerging evidence with respect to these questions in mammals.  ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
491;28027391;Regulation of BC200 RNA-mediated translation inhibition by hnRNP E1 and E2.;"The long noncoding RNA BC200 (brain cytoplasmic RNA, 200 nucleotides) acts as a translational modulator of local protein synthesis at dendrites. BC200 RNA has been shown to inhibit translation in vitro, but it remains unknown how this translation inhibition might be controlled in a cell. Here, we performed yeast three-hybrid screening and identified hnRNP E1 and hnRNP E2 as BC200 RNA-interacting proteins. We found that: these hnRNA proteins could restore BC200 RNA-inhibited translation; BC200 RNA interacts with hnRNP E1 and E2 mainly through its unique 3' C-rich domain; and the RNA binding specificities and modes of the two proteins differed somewhat. Our results offer new insights into the regulation of BC200 RNA-mediated translation inhibition. ";polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
493;7972011;Spatially controlled adhesion, spreading, and differentiation of endothelial cells on self-assembled molecular monolayers.;Chemically modified glass substrates were used to demonstrate differential adhesion, growth, and differentiation of endothelial cells. Endothelial cells were examined for adhesion and growth on glass, glass treated with N-(2-aminoethyl)-3-aminopropyl trimethoxysilane (EDA), or EDA with a subsequent treatment with physically adsorbed extracellular matrix components human fibronectin and heparin sulfate. EDA and EDA/human fibronectin showed similar abilities to support adhesion, spreading, and proliferation of endothelial cells. In contrast, heparin sulfate inhibited endothelial cell adhesion to EDA. Differentiation of endothelial cells resulting in precapillary cord formation was triggered by addition of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). On EDA and EDA/human fibronectin bFGF causes confluent endothelial cell monolayers to differentiate and form cords, which resulted in a large-scale spatial redistribution of cells on the surface. Formation of organized neovascular assemblies was demonstrated on coplanar molecular patterns of EDA and a nonadhesive perfluorinated alkylsilane (tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl)-1-dimethylchloros ilane (13F). Endothelial cells preferentially adhered to the EDA lines and after 24-48 hr, microfilaments aligned with the long axes of the patterned EDA region. Finally, endothelial cells that became confluent within the confines of the EDA region (bound by the nonadhesive, 13F domains) were observed to differentiate into neovascular cords in long-term culture (7-10 days) with bFGF.;-;-;-;hard_0
495;10217429;Structure of the human CpG-island-containing lung Kruppel-like factor (LKLF) gene and its location in chromosome 19p13.11-13 locus.;We have cloned earlier a short human genomic fragment which showed strong similarity with the mouse cDNA encoding lung Kruppel-like zinc finger transcription factor (LKLF), predominantly expressed in mouse developing lung, spleen, and vascular system, which might play a key role in programming the quiescent state of single positive T cells and blood vessel wall morphogenesis. Here we report the successful cloning of the human LKLF cDNA, its genomic structure and chromosomal localization at the 19p13.11-p13.13 locus. The full-length human LKLF cDNA has longer 5'-UTR with higher GC content than mouse cDNA and encodes a predicted protein of 355 amino acids which has three zinc fingers at the C-terminus and a proline-rich N-terminal domain. Human and mouse proteins share 87.3% identity and 90.2% amino acid similarity. The human LKLF gene consists of three exons.

498;8267349;Neuroblastoma and diagnostic imaging.;To assess the utility of the current imaging modalities, a six-year retrospective study was conducted from May 1985 through April 1991 on 11 patients with histopathologically confirmed neuroblastoma. There were four males and seven females. Median age at presentation was six years. All patients underwent intravenous urography (IVU), abdominal ultrasonography (US), skeletal surveys and bone marrow aspiration. Computed tomographic (CT) scanning was performed in nine patients and trephine bone biopsy in five. Suprarenal gland was the primary site in six patients, including one bilateral neuroblastoma. Two presented with primary paraspinal mass, one with posterior mediastinal mass, one had a retroperitoneal tumour and one presented as primary cerebral neuroblastoma. IVU showed indirect evidence of suprarenal tumours in five patients. US demonstrated suprarenal mass in six and calcification within the mass in five patients. US also documented retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy in five patients. US-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy was performed in seven patients and it gave correct histological diagnosis in all. CT accurately depicted all the primary tumours and their involvement of the surrounding structures and metastases in the brain and orbits. US proved to be quite accurate in diagnosing primary abdominal tumours despite its limitations but in other sites, CT was of greater help. Solid appearance of a suprarenal mass on US made the diagnosis of neuroblastoma very likely and calcification within the mass further supported the diagnosis.;-;-;-;hard_0
506;8195160;A protein which binds preferentially to single-stranded core sequence of autonomously replicating sequence is essential for respiratory function in mitochondrial of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.;From yeast nuclear extract, we have identified several DNA-protein complexes using the T-rich strand of core consensus sequence of autonomously replicating sequence by gel shift assay. One of them showed preferential binding to the T-rich sequence of the DNA. We have partially purified a protein constituent of this complex and cloned its gene. The gene has an open reading frame encoding a protein of 380 amino acids (M(r) = 42,100) which is processed to a mature protein of 371 amino acids (M(r) = 40,900). The protein has neither significant amino acid homology with any previously reported proteins nor characteristic motifs. A putative HAP2/HAP3/HAP4 binding sequence was found at about 1 kilobase upstream of the gene. Disruption of the chromosomal gene revealed that the gene was neither essential for cell viability nor involved in DNA replication, but was essential for mitochondrial respiratory function. We therefore named the gene MRF1 for mitochondrial respiratory function 1. In a mrf1 null mutant the absorption spectra of cytochromes b, a, and a3 were undetectable, although mitochondrial DNA and protein synthesis in mitochondria were intact. Antibodies against MRF1 detected the antigen localized predominantly in the nucleus in vivo. These results suggest that MRF1 is a transcriptional regulatory protein of some genes whose products are necessary for the functional assembly of mitochondrial respiratory proteins. ;polythreonine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
509;8400236;PML protein expression in hematopoietic and acute promyelocytic leukemia cells.;Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is thought to be caused by the t(15,17) translocation that fuses the PML gene to that of the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR alpha) and generates a PML/RAR alpha fusion protein. Yet, paradoxically, APL cells are exquisitely sensitive to retinoic acid (RA), as they terminally differentiate upon RA exposure. In this report, we have examined the expression of PML and PML/RAR alpha in normal and APL cells. By immunofluorescence or immunocytochemistry, we show that PML has a speckled nuclear pattern of expression that contrasts with that of PML/RAR alpha (mostly a micropunctuated nuclear pattern or a cytoplasmic localization). The APL-derived cell line NB4 that expresses both the PML and PML/RAR alpha genes also shows the fine micropunctuated nuclear pattern, suggesting a dominant effect of the fusion protein over the localization of wild-type PML. RA treatment of NB4 cells or clones expressing PML/RAR alpha gradually leads to a PML pattern before apparent morphologic maturation. In 14 untreated APL patients, the PML-reactive proteins were cytoplasmic (by immunocytochemistry) or both cytoplasmic and nuclear with a micropunctuated pattern (by immunofluorescence). Strikingly, in 4 patients, after 1 to 2 weeks of RA therapy, the speckled nuclear PML pattern reappeared concomitant with the onset of differentiation. These results establish that fusion of PML to RAR alpha results in an altered localization of PML that is reverted upon RA treatment. This observation, which highlights the importance of PML, is likely to be a key to unravelling the molecular mechanism of both leukemogenesis and RA-induced differentiation of APL.;-;-;-;hard_0
510;14676199;Differential export requirements for shuttling serine/arginine-type mRNA-binding proteins.;Messenger RNAs are transported to the cytoplasm bound to several shuttling mRNA-binding proteins. Here, we present the characterization of Hrb1, a novel component of the transported ribonucleoprotein complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The protein is similar to the other two serine/arginine (SR)-type proteins in yeast, Gbp2 and Npl3. Hrb1 is nuclear at steady state and its import is mediated by the karyopherin Mtr10. Hrb1 binds to poly(A)+ RNA in vivo and its binding is significantly increased in MTR10 mutants, suggesting a role for Mtr10 in dissociating Hrb1 from the mRNAs. Interestingly, by comparing the export requirements of all three SR proteins we find similarities but also striking differences. While the export of all three proteins is dependent on the export of mRNAs in general, as no transport is observed in mutants defective in transcription (rpb1-1) or mRNA export (mex67-5), we find specific requirements for components of the THO complex, involved in transcription elongation. While both Hrb1 and Gbp2 depend on Mft1 and Hpr1 for their nuclear export, Npl3 is exported independently of both proteins. These findings suggest that Hrb1 and Gbp2, but not Npl3, might be loaded onto the growing mRNA via the THO complex components Mtf1 and Hrp1. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
511;8836172;Transcriptional repression by the orphan steroid receptor RVR/Rev-erb beta is dependent on the signature motif and helix 5 in the E region: functional evidence for a biological role of RVR in myogenesis.;"RVR/Rev-erb beta/BD73 is an orphan steroid receptor that has no known ligand in the ""classical' sense. RVR binds as a monomer to an element which consists of an A/T-rich sequence upstream of the consensus hexameric half-site. However, RVR does not activate transcription and blocks transactivation of this element by ROR/RZR. The mechanism of RVR action remains obscure, hence we used the GAL4 hybrid system to identify and characterize an active transcriptional silencer in the ligand binding domain (LBD) of RVR. Rigorous deletion and mutational analysis demonstrated that this repressor domain is encoded by amino acids 416-449 of RVR. Furthermore, we demonstrated that efficient repression is dependent on the so-called LBD-specific signature motif, (F/W)AKxxxxFxxLxxxDQxxLL (which spans loop3-4 and helix 4) and helix 5 (H5; identified in the crystal structures of the steroid receptor LBDs). Although RVR is expressed in many adult tissues, including skeletal muscle, and during embryogenesis, its physiological function in differentiation and mammalian development remains unknown. Since other 'orphans', e.g. COUP-TF II and Rev-erbA alpha, have been demonstrated to regulate muscle and adipocyte differentiation, we investigated the expression and functional role of RVR during mouse myogenesis. In C2C12 myogenic cells, RVR mRNA was detected in proliferating myoblasts and was suppressed when the cells were induced to differentiate into post-mitotic, multinucleated myotubes by serum withdrawal. This decrease in RVR mRNA correlated with the appearance of muscle-specific markers (e.g. myogenin mRNA). RVR 'loss of function' studies by constitutive over-expression of a dominant negative RVR delta E resulted in increased levels of p21Cip1/Waf1 and myogenin mRNAs after serum withdrawal. Time course studies indicated that expression of RVR delta E mRNA results in the precocious induction and accumulation of myogenin and p21 mRNAs after serum withdrawal. In addition, we demonstrated that over-expression of the COUP-TF II and Rev-erbA alpha receptors in C2C12 cells completely blocked induction of p21 mRNA after serum withdrawal. In conclusion, our studies identified a potent transcriptional repression domain in RVR, characterized critical amino acids within the silencing region and provide evidence for the physiological role of RVR during myogenesis.

512;10104718;Hazardous waste disposal and the clinical laboratory.;Negligent, unregulated hazardous waste management has resulted in real and potential threats to public health and safety. The federal government has responded with laws and regulations aimed at the producers of hazardous waste, including clinical laboratories. Clinical laboratory managers must understand how the requirements apply to their facilities and how to comply with them, or risk violating the law. The Resources Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) imposes controls on hazardous waste management through the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Transportation (DOT) regulate these activities through 40 CFR and 49 CFR, respectively. 49 CFR specifies the characteristics of hazardous waste and lists more than 400 toxic chemicals, including several commonly used in clinical laboratories. Laboratories must conduct chemical inventories to determine if they should obtain an EPA identification number as a hazardous waste generator. Most clinical laboratories can operate satellite accumulation points and accumulate, store, transport, and dispose of waste in accordance with EPA and DOT regulations. Regulations pertaining to infectious waste, sure to affect many clinical laboratories, are being developed now by the EPA. The tracking system mandated by the federal government can be supplemented by state and local authorities and poses a significant regulatory challenge to clinical laboratory managers.;-;-;-;hard_0
515;2571128;Structure and methylation of the human calcitonin/alpha-CGRP gene.;We report a detailed analysis of the human calcitonin/alpha-CGRP gene locus. About 39kb of DNA containing the gene has been mapped and a common Pvu II RFLP identified downstream of the gene. DNA sequence analysis revealed an extensive CpG island containing several rare restriction enzyme sites at the 5' end of the gene. The structure of this island is unusual in that it contains two distinct CpG-rich regions, one located around exon 1 and the other about 1.5kb further upstream. Msp I sites within both CpG-rich regions were found to be unmethylated, regardless of whether the calcitonin/alpha-CGRP gene was being expressed. However, a correlation was found between demethylation of Msp I sites in intron 2, downstream of the CpG island, and calcitonin/alpha-CGRP gene expression. DNA sequence analysis also revealed the presence of several binding sites for constitutive and regulatory transcription factors in the promoter of the gene. These results suggest that both unmethylated CpG islands and specific demethylation of internal sequences may play a role in the activation of calcitonin/alpha-CGRP gene transcription. ;polyglycine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

518;9529911;Visual inertia of rotating 3-D objects.;Five experiments were designed to determine whether a rotating, transparent 3-D cloud of dots (simulated sphere) could influence the perceived direction of rotation of a subsequent sphere. Experiment 1 established conditions under which the direction of rotation of a virtual sphere was perceived unambiguously. When a near-far luminance difference and perspective depth cues were present, observers consistently saw the sphere rotate in the intended direction. In Experiment 2, a near-far luminance difference was used to create an unambiguous rotation sequence that was followed by a directionally ambiguous rotation sequence that lacked both the near-far luminance cue and the perspective cue. Observers consistently saw the second sequence as rotating in the same direction as the first, indicating the presence of 3-D visual inertia. Experiment 3 showed that 3-D visual inertia was sufficiently powerful to bias the perceived direction of a rotation sequence made unambiguous by a near-far luminance cue. Experiment 5 showed that 3-D visual inertia could be obtained using an occlusion depth cue to create an unambiguous inertia-inducing sequence. Finally, Experiments 2, 4, and 5 all revealed a fast-decay phase of inertia that lasted for approximately 800 msec, followed by an asymptotic phase that lasted for periods as long as 1,600 msec. The implications of these findings are examined with respect to motion mechanisms of 3-D visual inertia.;-;-;-;hard_0

523;22057519;Glycosylated self-assembled monolayers for arrays and surface analysis.;Over the past few decades, carbohydrates (glycans) have received growing attention for their many roles in biological systems, including pathogenesis, receptor-ligand interactions, and cell signaling. To unravel the biology of this important category of biomolecules, a host of new tools have been developed for glycomics investigation. At the forefront is the carbohydrate microarray, developed to immobilize functional glycans on a solid substrate to rapidly screen a variety of potential binding partners (carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, cells, and viruses). The essential role played by surface modification on glycan microarray performance requires new methods to rigorously characterize glycan surface chemistries. Due to their highly reproducible nature and well-studied properties, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on gold are powerful models for presenting glycans on a solid substrate, engineering biomimetic microenvironments and exploring the bioactivity of immobilized carbohydrates via surface plasmon resonance (SPR). However, it can be challenging to prepare high quality glycosylated SAMs (glyco-SAMs) that retain their biological function following surface immobilization. Herein, a selection of versatile methods for the preparation of glyco-SAMs using natural and chemically modified glycans is described. This chapter will highlight the following three immobilization techniques: (1) direct self assembly using thiolated glycosides onto gold, (2) tethering aminated glycosides onto -amine-reactive SAMs, and (3) conjugating natural glycan onto divinyl sulfone-activated SAMs.;-;-;-;hard_0
527;3311748;A structural and dynamic model for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.;"Folding of the five polypeptide subunits (alpha 2 beta gamma delta) of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) into a functional structural model is described. The principles used to arrange the sequences into a structure include: (1) hydrophobicity----membrane-crossing segments; (2) amphipathic character----ion-carrying segments (ion channel with single group rotations); (3) molecular shape (elongated, pentagonal cylinder)----folding dimensions of exobilayer portion; (4) choice of acetylcholine binding sites----specific folding of exobilayer segments; (5) location of reducible disulfides (near agonist binding site)----additional specification of exobilayer arrangement; (6) genetic homology----consistency of functional group choices; (7) noncompetitive antagonist labeling----arrangement of bilayer helices. The AChR model is divided into three parts: (a) exobilayer consisting of 11 antiparallel beta-strands from each subunit; (b) bilayer consisting of four hydrophobic and one amphiphilic alpha-helix from each subunit; (c) cytoplasmic consisting of one (folded) loop from each subunit. The exobilayer strands can form a closed 'flower' (the 'resting state') which is opened ('activated') by agonists bound perpendicular to the strands. Rearrangement of the agonists to a strand-parallel position and partial closing of the 'flower' leads to a desensitized receptor. The actions of acetylcholine and succinoyl and suberoyl bis-cholines are clarified by the model. The opening and closing of the exobilayer 'flower' controls access to the ion channel which is composed of the five amphiphilic bilayer helices. A molecular mechanism for ion flow in the channel is given. Openings interrupted by short duration closings (50 microseconds) depend upon channel group motions. The unusual photolabeling of intrabilayer serines in alpha, beta and delta subunits but not in gamma subunits near the binding site for non-competitive antagonists is explained along with a mechanism for the action of these antagonists such as phencyclidine. The unusual alpha 192Cys-193Cys disulfide may have a special peptide arrangement, such as a cis-peptide bond to a following proline (G.A. Petsko and E.M. Kosower, unpublished results). The position of phosphorylatable sites and proline-rich segments are noted for the cytoplasmic loops. The dynamic behavior of the AChR channel and many different experimental results can be interpreted in terms of the model. An example is the lowering of ionic conductivity on substitution of bovine for Torpedo delta M2 segment. The model represents a useful construct for the design of experiments on AChR.";polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function

Different hybridomas tended to express VH genes of the same family when the cognate Ag had the same or similar carbohydrate structures; i.e., the VH genes of the J558 family (group 1) were preferentially expressed in the mAb directed to various gangliosides that have NeuAc alpha (or NeuGc alpha) 2-3 and/or 2-8 linkage (71%), the most common linkage of sialic acid residues in the gangliosides of higher animals, and the hybridomas directed to sulfated glycolipids also expressed mainly the VH genes of the J558 family (80%). In contrast, the five mAb directed to various gangliosides with NeuAc alpha 2-6 linkage were exclusively encoded by the VH genes of Q52 family (group 2, 100%), and three antibodies directed to gangliosides with a NeuAc alpha 2-9 linkage all expressed genes of J606 family (group 6, 100%). The VH family usage was largely correlated with the linkage of sialic acid residues in the cognate carbohydrate Ag, but was not correlated at all with the difference in the fine specificities toward the core neutral carbohydrate chain, to which the sialic acid residues were attached. These findings suggest that the VH gene family in these anticarbohydrate antibodies is selected, depending primarily on the linkage of the sialic acid residues in carbohydrate Ag; these residues form the immunodominant sugar residue in the respective antigenic determinant.

The wide range of trials in these disease areas have been reviewed for CPT-11, topotecan, and 9-aminocamptothecin. A therapeutic role is anticipated for these and other camptothecins in these disease sites. Issues in guiding treatment indications and clinical development include: 1) pharmacokinetics and scheduling relevant to each of the drugs, with the oral route emerging as a practical way for testing prolonged exposure; 2) dose-intensification with cytokines, and its relevance in maintaining effective doses particularly in combination with other myelosuppressive drugs; and 3) pharmacodynamic determinants of response-an area of research that is particularly attractive because topoisomerase I is the target for camptothecins.";-;-;-;hard_0
535;10448092;The DNA-binding and transcriptional activities of MAZ, a myc-associated zinc finger protein, are regulated by casein kinase II.;Myc-associated zinc finger protein (MAZ) is a transcription factor that contains proline-rich, alanine repeats and six C(2)H(2)-type zinc finger motifs, as well as five putative sites of phosphorylation by casein kinase II (CKII). Site-specific mutagenesis of MAZ revealed that the serine residue at position 480 was the major site of phosphorylation by CKII both in vitro and in vivo. Phosphorylation of MAZ by CKII at this serine residue was required for maximum binding of MAZ to the pyrimidine-rich DNA of the nuclease-hypersensitive element (NHE) in the 5'-end promoter region of the c-myc gene. Mutation of serine at position 480 to alanine eliminated the DNA-binding activity of MAZ to this element. Moreover, the mutated MAZ was unable to enhance the expression of luciferase encoded by a c-myc promoter/luciferase reporter gene in HeLa cells in the presence of CKII. These results suggest that phosphorylation of the serine residue at position 480 of MAZ by CKII can control the function of MAZ by altering its DNA-binding activity. ;polyproline;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
538;8593570;Cortical field potentials preceding vocalization and influences of cerebellar hemispherectomy upon them in monkeys.;Field potentials preceding vocalization were recorded with electrodes chronically implanted on the surface and at 2.0-3.0 mm depth in various cortical areas in three monkeys. Surface-negative, depth-positive (s-N, d-P) slow potentials prior to vocalization were recorded in the premotor (including the Broca's homology), motor and somatosensory cortices in both hemispheres, and the supplementary motor area in the cerebral hemisphere. Such premovement potentials were recorded also in the cingulate and prefrontal cortices when a monkey uttered with intense motivation for reward. Cerebellar hemispherectomy on the right side eliminated the s-N, d-P premovement potentials in the motor cortex and in the posterior bank of inferior limb of the arcuate sulcus (homolog of Broca's area) in the left hemisphere. Vocal tone contained less components in different frequencies, and its duration became more variable than before the operation. These facts suggest that the neocortical area homologous to the human speech area takes part in generation and control of monkey vocalization together with the cerebellum, possibly through cerebro-cerebellar interactions, against ideas so far offered on nonhuman primate vocalization.;-;-;-;hard_0
541;7277222;Motor unit firing and its relation to tremor in the tonic vibration reflex of the decerebrate cat.;"1. The discharge of single motor units has been recorded from the soleus muscle of the decerebrate cat during the tonic vibration reflex elicited isometrically, to further understanding of the tremor that is seen in the reflex contraction. The reflex was elicited by pulses of vibration of 50 micrometers amplitude at 150 Hz, and up to four units were studied concurrently. 2. Individual units fired rather regularly and at a low frequency (range 4-14 Hz). The rate of firing of any unit normally fell within the frequency band of the tremor recorded at the same time. On comparing different preparations a higher frequency of tremor was associated with a higher frequency of motor firing. 3. The responses of pairs of motor units recorded concurrently during repeated production of the reflex were compared by cross-correlation analysis; over 1000 spikes from each train were normally used for this. The major of the cross-correlograms were flat with no overt sign of any synchronization between the units other than that due to the vibration. 4. Clear indications of correlated motor unit firing could be produced deliberately by modulating the amplitude of vibration at a frequency comparable to that of the normal tremor and thereby introducing a rhythmic component into the tonic vibration reflex. 5. About 20% of the cross-correlograms obtained during normal tremor showed varying amounts of an irregular 'waviness' suggesting a possible correlation between the times of firing of a pair of units. But such waves never developed steadily throughout the period of analysis, in contrast to the comparable waves produced on modulating the vibration. Similar waves were seen on cross-correlating a motor unit with an electronic oscillator, confirming that their occurrence does not necessarily demonstrate the existence of active neural interactions. 6. It is concluded that there is no strong and widespread neural synchronizing mechanism active during the tonic vibration reflex, although the possibility of some weak neural interactions has not been excluded. The findings favour the idea that the tremor in this preparation is simply the inevitable result of motor units discharging asynchronously, but at closely similar subtetanic frequencies.";-;-;-;hard_0
549;7851632;Alanine aminopeptidase of guinea-pig brain: a broad specificity cytoplasmic enzyme capable of hydrolysing short and intermediate length peptides.;Alanine aminopeptidase is reported to be a broad specificity aminopeptidase acting on peptides of different lengths. In this study we wish to define the properties of the activity from guinea-pig brain and compare these properties with previous findings. Alanine amino-peptidase was purified from cytoplasm of guinea-pig brain by a four-step procedure involving chromatography on DE-52, hydroxylapatite, Sephacryl S-200 and DEAE-Sephacryl. Relative molecular mass was determined by chromatography on Sephacryl S-200 column and subunit size determined by SDS-PAGE under denaturing conditions. Cations which reactivate the enzyme were determined with EDTA treated enzyme. Substrate specificity was determined by TLC and kinetic parameters were derived from Lineweaver-Burk plots. A 216-fold purification was achieved by the above procedures. The purified enzyme was found to consist of one polypeptide chain with a relative molecular mass of 104,000. Its activity was inhibited by chelating agents, sulphydryl reactive agents, puromycin, bestatin and amastatin but stimulated over 6-fold by dithiothreitol. Some dipeptides and all tripeptides and longer peptides containing up to 16 amino acids tested were hydrolysed provided neither Glp or Pro occurred at the N-terminus or that Pro did not occur in the penultimate position from the N-terminus. The enzyme preferred bulky non-polar residues at the N-terminal and penultimate positions and was found to hydrolyse three dipeptidyl methyl coumarin amides used in detecting dipeptidyl aminopeptidases. Alanine aminopeptidase is thus a broad specificity amino-peptidase acting on short and intermediate length peptides whose affinity for substrates increases with increasing peptide length. Its properties are well suited to a role in peptide turnover in brain cytoplasm.;-;-;-;hard_0

553;7939715;Formation of a monomeric DNA binding domain by Skn-1 bZIP and homeodomain elements.;"Maternally expressed Skn-1 protein is required for the correct specification of certain blastomere fates in early Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. Skn-1 contains a basic region similar to those of basic leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins but, paradoxically, it lacks a leucine zipper dimerization segment. Random sequence selection methods were used to show that Skn-1 binds to specific DNA sequences as a monomer. The Skn-1 basic region lies at the carboxyl terminus of an 85-amino acid domain that binds preferentially to a bZIP half-site and also recognizes adjacent 5' AT-rich sequences in the minor groove, apparently with an amino (NH2)-terminal ""arm"" related to those of homeodomain proteins. The intervening residues appear to stabilize interactions of these two subdomains with DNA. The Skn-1 DNA binding domain thus represents an alternative strategy for promoting binding of a basic region segment recognition helix to its cognate half-site. The results point to an underlying modularity in subdomains within established DNA binding domains. ";polythreonine;helix;-;LCR_with_function

The morbidity and mortality of cholera is resultant from large-volume diarrhea, hypovolemia, and electrolyte derangement. In the following case, a 60-year-old man with no recent travel history presented to the emergency department with muscle cramping, abdominal pain, and gastrointestinal distress. It was later confirmed that he was suffering from cholera. On presentation, he was hyperkalemic with ECG changes and soon went into a hypovolemic shock. After a complicated hospital course, he fortunately made a complete recovery. This case demonstrates that common complaints may result in uncommon diagnoses.

565;10097919;Islet cell and glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies present at diagnosis of diabetes predict the need for insulin treatment. A cohort study in young adults whose disease was initially labeled as type 2 or unclassifiable diabetes.;"OBJECTIVE
To clarify the predictive value of islet cell antibody (ICA) and GAD65 antibody (GADA) present at diagnosis with respect to the need for insulin treatment 6 years after diagnosis in young adults initially considered to have type 2 or unclassifiable diabetes.


RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
The patient material was representative of the entire Swedish population, consisting of patients who were 15-34 years old at diagnosis of diabetes in 1987-1988 but were not considered to have type 1 diabetes at onset. At follow-up, 6 years after the diagnosis, it was noted whether the patient was treated with insulin. The presence of ICA was determined by an immunofluorescence assay, and GADAs were measured by a radioligand assay.


RESULTS
Six years after diagnosis, 70 of 97 patients were treated with insulin, and 27 of 97 patients were treated with oral drugs or diet alone. At diagnosis, ICAs and GADAs were present in 41 (59%) of 70 patients and 41 (60%) of 68 patients, respectively, of those now treated with insulin, compared with only 1 (4%) of 26 patients and 2 (7%) of 27 patients who were still not treated with insulin. For either ICA or GADA, the corresponding frequencies were 50 (74%) of 68 for patients who were later treated with insulin and 3 (12%) of 26 for those who were still not treated with insulin, respectively. The sensitivity for later insulin treatment was highest (74%) for the presence of ICA or GADA, and the specificity was highest (100%) for ICA and GADA. The positive predictive value was 100% for the combination of ICA and GADA, 98% for ICA alone, and approximately 95% for GADA alone.


CONCLUSIONS
Determination of the presence of ICA and GADA at diagnosis of diabetes improves the classification of diabetes and predicts the future need of insulin in young adults.";-;-;-;hard_0
567;8639675;Tryptophan 60-D in the B-insertion loop of thrombin modulates the thrombin-antithrombin reaction.;In a recent study it was demonstrated that thrombin des-PPW reacts with antithrombin (AT) very poorly. In this study it is shown that a Trp to Ala (W60A) mutant of thrombin also reacts with AT at a lower rate than thrombin. The inhibition kinetics were studied by the slow-binding kinetic approach. In both the presence and absence of heparin, the pseudo-first-order rate constant of thrombin inhibition (kobs) increased linearly with AT concentration, indicating that inhibition, in the concentration range covered, conforms to a bimolecular reaction E+I-->K assn E-I. Only the second-order association rate constant (kassn) for thrombin can be estimated [6.8 +/- 2.7) x 10(3) M-1 s-1 in the absence of heparin and (4.1 +/- 1.2) x 10(6) M-1 s-1 in the presence of heparin]. With W60A and des-PPW, the kobs of inhibition increased hyperbolically as a function of AT concentration, indicating that the inhibition is a two-step process according to E+I<==>K init E.I-->k2 E-I. The kinetic constants for W60A were estimated to be Kinit = 13.6 +/- 3.3 microM and k2 = 0.007 +/- 0.001 s-1 in the absence of heparin and K init = 13.6 +/- 3.1 nM and k2 = 0.008 +/- 0.002 s-1 in the presence of heparin. AT inhibited des-PPW very slowly [K assn = (2.9 +/- 0.7) x 10(1) M-1 s-1], but heparin accelerated the reaction approximately 20,000-fold and made it possible to demonstrate a two-step reaction mechanism for des-PPW with K init = 10.4 +/- 2.3 nM and k2 = 0.006 +/- 0.001 s-1. In contrast to thrombin, an active AT-binding pentasaccharide enhanced the inhibition of des-PPW approximately 15-fold. These results indicate that (1) in contrast to thrombin, the heparin-induced conformational change in AT is required for optimal inhibition of des-PPW and (1) Trp60 is essential for normal thrombin-AT reaction. On the basis of these results, a modified model for thrombin-AT interaction is proposed.;-;-;-;hard_0

Recombinant VP6 polypeptide was able to restore the transcriptional activity in purified viral cores from both SA-11 and RF rotavirus strains. Recombinant group C VP 6 (Cowden strain) is capable of binding as a trimer to group A viral core particles but unable to restore the transcriptase activity, suggesting that the binding of the polypeptide to cores is not the only requirement to restore the transcriptase activity. The VP 6 group A polypeptide was shown to bind as a monomer to viral cores, indicating that trimerization of VP 6 may be not required for reconstitution of the polymerase activity.;-;-;-;hard_0

Six dogs were anaesthetised and infused intravenously with Ringer's solution (90-100mL/kg/h) for 60 min. Thereafter, furosemide was administered and dogs were monitored for 60 min. Plasma ANP and NT-proBNP concentrations were determined by chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay and enzyme immunoassay, respectively. Volume overload significantly increased plasma ANP and NT-proBNP concentrations (P<0.001); however, preload reduction significantly reduced plasma ANP concentrations (P<0.05) without concurrent changes in plasma NT-proBNP. Mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressures were strongly correlated with plasma ANP concentrations (r=0.53, P<0.001), but not plasma NT-proBNP. Thus, plasma ANP is a useful, non-invasive parameter for measuring rapid haemodynamic changes.";-;-;-;hard_0
578;12388722;The Herpesvirus Saimiri open reading frame 73 gene product interacts with the cellular protein p32.;"The role of the gamma-2 herpesvirus open reading frame (ORF) 73 gene product has become the focus of considerable interest. It has recently been shown that the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) is expressed during a latent infection and can modulate both viral and cellular gene expression. The herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) ORF 73 gene product has some sequence homology to LANA; however, the role of HVS ORF 73 is unknown. We have previously demonstrated that HVS ORF73 is expressed in a stably transduced human carcinoma cell line, where HVS genomes persist as nonintegrated circular episomes. This implies that there may be some functional homology between these proteins. To further investigate the role of the HVS ORF 73 protein, the yeast two-hybrid system was employed to identify interacting cellular proteins. We demonstrate that ORF 73 interacts with the cellular protein p32 and triggers the accumulation of p32 in the nucleus. Using reporter gene-based transient-transfection assays, we demonstrate that ORF 73 can transactivate a number of heterologous promoter constructs and also upregulate its own promoter. Moreover, ORF 73 and p32 act synergistically to transactivate these promoters. The binding of ORF 73 to p32 is mediated by an amino-terminal arginine-rich domain, which contains two functionally distinct nuclear localization signals. The p32 binding domains are required for ORF 73 transactivating abilities and for ORF 73 to induce nuclear accumulation of p32. These results suggest that ORF 73 can function as a regulator of gene expression and that p32 is involved in ORF 73-dependent transcriptional activation. ";polyarginine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
579;11261509;Sequence-selective DNA binding drugs mithramycin A and chromomycin A3 are potent inhibitors of neuronal apoptosis induced by oxidative stress and DNA damage in cortical neurons.;"Global inhibitors of RNA or protein synthesis such as actinomycin D or cycloheximide abrogate neuronal apoptosis induced by numerous pathological stimuli in vitro and in vivo. The clinical application of actinomycin D or cycloheximide to human neurological disease has been limited by the toxicities of these agents. To overcome these toxicities, strategies must be developed to inhibit selectively the expression of deleterious proapoptotic proteins, while leaving the expression of antiapoptotic, proregeneration, and other critical homeostatic proteins unperturbed. Mithramycin A (trade name Plicamycin) is an aureolic acid antibiotic that has been used in humans to treat hypercalcemia and several types of cancers. This class of agents is believed to act, in part, by selectively inhibiting gene expression by displacing transcriptional activators that bind to G-C-rich regions of promoters. Here we demonstrate that mithramycin A and its structural analog chromomycin A3 are potent inhibitors of neuronal apoptosis induced by glutathione depletion-induced oxidative stress or the DNA-damaging agent camptothecin. We correlate the protective effects of mithramycin A with its ability to inhibit enhanced DNA binding of the transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3 to their cognate ""G-C"" box induced by oxidative stress or DNA damage. The protective effects of mithramycin A cannot be attributed to global inhibition of protein synthesis. Together, these results suggest that mithramycin A and its structural analogs may be effective agents for the treatment of neurological diseases associated with aberrant activation of apoptosis and highlight the potential use of sequence-selective DNA-binding drugs as neurological therapeutics.

The aim of this study was to determine the etiologic factors in the formation of significant pericardial effusion after orthotopic heart transplantation and to determine the association of pericardial effusion with survival.


BACKGROUND
The formation of pericardial effusions has been well described after orthotopic heart transplantation, but the risk factors for development of effusions remain unclear. Rejection and cyclosporine have been cited as possible causes, but anatomic factors have not been studied.


METHODS
We conducted a retrospective review of medical records and echocardiograms of 203 consecutive patients at one center, including ischemic time, incidence and severity of rejection, weight difference between donor and recipient and previous cardiac surgical history. Multivariate analysis was performed, and actuarial survival rate curves were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method.


RESULTS
Eighteen (8.9%) of 203 transplant recipients developed moderate to large pericardial effusions. Forty-four percent of patients required pericardiocentesis, and 28% subsequently required pericardiectomy for management of the effusions. Multivariate analysis identified the presence of a positive weight difference between recipient and donor (recipient weight > donor weight) and the lack of previous median sternotomy as the most powerful predictors of effusion formation. No significant association was found with rejection. There was no difference in actuarial survival rate between patients with and without effusions.


CONCLUSIONS
A positive mismatch in weight between recipient and donor and the absence of previous cardiac surgery are associated with the formation of significant pericardial effusions. Closer monitoring of these patients at risk may be warranted.";-;-;-;hard_0

Translation products were then tested in vivo for specific suppression of the anti-HEL antibody response. LH8-105 culture supernatant and translation products of LH8-105 poly(A)+ RNA or a mixture of alpha and beta chain-homologous mRNA induce HEL-specific suppression whereas translation products of LH8-105 mRNA eluted from irrelevant DNA or unrecombined mRNA eluted from alpha and beta cDNA do not exert suppressive activity.

Full-thickness scale burns were made on rats. Serum IL-6 levels (SIL-6) showed a constant time-dependent change with a single peak 6 hours after the burn. SIL-6 elevation was correlated with the ratio of burn area to total body surface area. The liver, spleen, lymph node and skin harvested after the burn secreted significantly higher amounts of IL-6 after tissue culture when compared with those taken from sham rats. The venous serum drainage from the burn site induced significantly higher IL-6 production of splenocytes than the arterial and control venous sera.

589;9041241;Short-chain fatty acid-supplemented total parenteral nutrition enhances functional adaptation to intestinal resection in rats.;"BACKGROUND & AIMS
Intestinal adaptation is a complex physiological process that is not completely understood. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) induces intestinal atrophy that is prevented by the systemic administration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) as measured by morphological indices (i.e., mucosal weight and mucosal DNA, RNA, and protein concentration). The aim of this study was to examine the effect of SCFA-supplemented TPN on functional markers of intestinal adaptation.


METHODS
Forty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent an 80% jejunoileal resection and jugular catheterization. Rats received standard TPN or an isoenergetic, isonitrogenous TPN supplemented with SCFA (TPN + SCFA). Animals were further randomized to receive nutrient solutions for 3 or 7 days.


RESULTS
Ileal uptakes of D-glucose were higher (P < 0.05) in both TPN + SCFA groups. Expression of glucose transporter (GLUT)2 messenger RNA (mRNA) was higher (P < 0.007) in the TPN + SCFA group at day 3. Expression of sodium-dependent glucose transporter 1 tended to be higher in both TPN + SCFA groups (P = 0.1). Na+,K+-adenosine triphosphatase mRNA was significantly more abundant in the TPN groups. GLUT5 and sucrase-isomaltase mRNA abundance did not differ between groups.


CONCLUSIONS
Intravenous SCFAs facilitate intestinal adaptation after resection by increasing basolateral intestinal nutrient transport. The addition of SCFAs to current TPN formulations may be warranted to improve functional characteristics of the gastrointestinal tract.";-;-;-;hard_0
590;25201104;RNA-binding proteins in regulation of alternative cleavage and polyadenylation.;"Almost all eukaryotic pre-mRNAs are processed at the 3' end by the cleavage and polyadenylation (C/P) reaction, which preludes termination of transcription and gives rise to the poly(A) tail of mature mRNA. Genomic studies in recent years have indicated that most eukaryotic mRNA genes have multiple cleavage and polyadenylation sites (pAs), leading to alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) products. APA isoforms generally differ in their 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs), but can also have different coding sequences (CDSs). APA expands the repertoire of transcripts expressed from the genome, and is highly regulated under various physiological and pathological conditions. Growing lines of evidence have shown that RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in regulation of APA. Some RBPs are part of the machinery for C/P; others influence pA choice through binding to adjacent regions. In this chapter, we review cis elements and trans factors involved in C/P, the significance of APA, and increasingly elucidated roles of RBPs in APA regulation. We also discuss analysis of APA using transcriptome-wide techniques as well as molecular biology approaches.  ";polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
591;19651139;Amino acid insertion reveals a necessary three-helical intermediate in the folding pathway of the colicin E7 immunity protein Im7.;The small (87-residue) alpha-helical protein Im7 (an inhibitor protein for colicin E7 that provides immunity to cells producing colicin E7) folds via a three-state mechanism involving an on-pathway intermediate. This kinetic intermediate contains three of four native helices that are oriented in a non-native manner so as to minimise exposed hydrophobic surface area at this point in folding. The short (6-residue) helix III has been shown to be unstructured in the intermediate ensemble and does not dock onto the developing hydrophobic core until after the rate-limiting transition state has been traversed. After helix III has docked, it adopts an alpha-helical secondary structure, and the side chains of residues within this region provide contacts that are crucial to native-state stability. In order to probe further the role of helix III in the folding mechanism of Im7, we created a variant that contains an eight-amino-acid polyalanine-like helix stabilised by a Glu-Arg salt bridge and an Asn-Pro-Gly capping motif, juxtaposed C-terminal to the natural 6-residue helix III. The effect of this insertion on the structure of the native protein and its folding mechanism were studied using NMR and varphi-value analysis, respectively. The results reveal a robust native structure that is not perturbed by the presence of the extended helix III. Mutational analysis performed to probe the folding mechanism of the redesigned protein revealed a conserved mechanism involving the canonical three-helical intermediate. The results suggest that folding via a three-helical species stabilised by both native and non-native interactions is an essential feature of Im7 folding, independent of the helical propensity of helix III. ;polyalanine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
592;8781232;Interaction of U2AF65 RS region with pre-mRNA branch point and promotion of base pairing with U2 snRNA [corrected].;The mammalian splicing factor U2AF65 binds to the polypyrimidine tract adjacent to the 3' splice site and promotes assembly of U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein on the upstream branch point, an interaction that involves base pairing with U2 small nuclear RNA (snRNA). U2AF65 contains an RNA binding domain, required for interaction with the polypyrimidine tract, and an arginine-serine-rich (RS) region, required for U2 snRNP recruitment and splicing. Here it is reported that binding of U2AF65 to the polypyrimidine tract directed the RS domain to contact the branch point and promoted U2 snRNA-branch point base pairing even in the absence of other splicing factors. Analysis of RS domain mutants indicated that the ability of U2AF65 to contact the branch point, to promote the U2 snRNA-branch point interaction, and to support splicing are related activities, requiring only a few basic amino acids. Thus, the U2AF65 RS domain plays a direct role in modulating spliceosomal RNA-RNA interactions. ;polyserine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

After day 14 PI, the whole intestine of C57BL/6 mice was contracted and significantly shortened in length, and charcoal meal transit was significantly faster compared with uninfected controls. After incubation in papaverine, the contracted intestines of C3H/HeJ mice did not relax, suggesting that the change is irreversible. In conclusion, N. seoulense has the potential to kill most strains of mice by causing irreversible damage to their intestine. The effects of mucosal mast cells on the survival rate of mice were negligible, because both W/Wv and +/+ mice died around day 20 PI.;-;-;-;hard_0
594;23972852;The arginine-rich RNA-binding motif of HIV-1 Rev is intrinsically disordered and folds upon RRE binding.;Arginine-rich motifs (ARMs) capable of binding diverse RNA structures play critical roles in transcription, translation, RNA trafficking, and RNA packaging. The regulatory HIV-1 protein Rev is essential for viral replication and belongs to the ARM family of RNA-binding proteins. During the early stages of the HIV-1 life cycle, incompletely spliced and full-length viral mRNAs are very inefficiently recognized by the splicing machinery of the host cell and are subject to degradation in the cell nucleus. These transcripts harbor the Rev Response Element (RRE), which orchestrates the interaction with the Rev ARM and the successive Rev-dependent mRNA export pathway. Based on established criteria for predicting intrinsic disorder, such as hydropathy, combined with significant net charge, the very basic primary sequences of ARMs are expected to adopt coil-like structures. Thus, we initiated this study to investigate the conformational changes of the Rev ARM associated with RNA binding. We used multidimensional NMR and circular dichroism spectroscopy to monitor the observed structural transitions, and described the conformational landscapes using statistical ensemble and molecular-dynamics simulations. The combined spectroscopic and simulated results imply that the Rev ARM is intrinsically disordered not only as an isolated peptide but also when it is embedded into an oligomerization-deficient Rev mutant. RRE recognition triggers a crucial coil-to-helix transition employing an induced-fit mechanism.  ;polyarginine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

596;7069159;Age and simple reaction time.;Although simple reaction time (RT) to a tone showed a statistically significant increase between 18 and 93 years of age in a sample of 220 men and women, the amount of increase was slight, less than 2 msec/decade. Consequently, the appreciable slowing of more typical behavior with age does not seen attributable to some general process in the central nervous system as has been argued. This degree of stability found for simple RT with age, unexpected from the body of previous work, may reflect equivalence of age groups and use of optimal RT technique. In a second study eight old participants (73 to 84 years) matched on the optimal technique with eight young participants (18 to 24 years) were markedly slower with a long constant preparatory interval but not with elimination of timing cues. Together, the two studies show that simple high level of preparation was either easy of impossible to attain. Behavioral slowing with age can result from ineffective control processes.;-;-;-;hard_0

The aims of this study were to evaluate the in vitro antioxidant and antidiabetic activities of the aqueous extract of Cissus polyantha leafy stems. The enzyme inhibitory activity was determined in vitro on α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes, followed by confirmative study in vivo on normal rats (oral starch and sucrose tolerance tests at doses of 111, 222, and 444 mg/kg). The ferric reducing antioxidant power and the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) antiradical activity of the extract were examined to evaluate the antioxidant potential of the extract. The total content of phenols, flavonoids, and tannins of the extract were also determined. The results showed an inhibitory effect of the extract on the α-amylase and α-glucosidase activities with IC50 values of 216.14 and 182.40 μg/mL, respectively. The extract at doses of 222 and 444 mg/kg induced a significant decrease in postprandial glycaemia during the starch and sucrose tolerance tests. A remarkable antiradical activity of the extract was obtained although lower than that of the standard product. The aqueous extract of leafy stems of Cissus polyantha has an interesting inhibitory activity on the α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes, as well as an antioxidant potential, thus validating its use in traditional medicine for the treatment of diabetes mellitus and its complications.;-;-;-;hard_0

Mephenesin, methocarbamol and diazepam abolished polysynaptic reflex contractions of the cat tibialis anterior muscle elicited by stimulation of the homolateral femoral nerve.2. Mephenesin and methocarbamol caused a prolongation of the mean refractory period of directly or indirectly stimulated skeletal muscle. These effects were due to a direct action on the muscle fibres. There was no effect on responses to single stimuli.3. The increase in refractory period produced by mephenesin was greater in indirectly than in directly stimulated rat diaphragms. Experiments using the isolated phrenic nerve suggest that this difference is due to the local anaesthetic action of mephenesin.4. In the indirectly stimulated cat tibialis anterior muscle high frequency stimulation resulted in a non-maintained tetanus in the presence of mephenesin and methocarbamol.5.

608;15961579;Profiling dendritic cell maturation with dedicated microarrays.;"Dendritic cell (DC) maturation is the process by which immature DC in the periphery differentiate into fully competent antigen-presenting cells that initiate the T cell response. However, DC respond to many distinct maturation stimuli, and different types of mature DC induce qualitatively different T cell responses. As DC maturation involves the coordinated regulation of hundreds of genes, comprehensive assessment of DC maturation status would ideally involve monitoring the expression of all of these transcripts. However, whole-genome microarrays are not well-suited for routine phenotyping of DC, as the vast majority of genes represented on such chips are not relevant to DC biology, and their cost limits their use for most laboratories. We therefore developed a DC-dedicated microarray, or ""DC Chip"", incorporating probes for 121 genes up-regulated during DC maturation, 93 genes down-regulated during maturation, 14 DC-specific genes, and 90 other genes with known or probable immune functions. These microarrays were used to study the kinetics of DC maturation and the differences in maturation profiles among five healthy donors after stimulation with tumor necrosis factor-alpha + polyI:C. Results obtained with the DC Chip were consistent with flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and real-time polymerase chain reaction, as well as previously published data. Furthermore, the coordinated regulation of a cluster of genes (indoleamine dioxygenase, kynureninase, kynurenine monoxygenase, tryptophanyl tRNA synthetase, and 3-hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-dioxygenase) involved in tryptophan metabolism was observed. These data demonstrate the use of the DC Chip for monitoring the molecular processes involved in the orientation of the immune response by DC. ";polyisoleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
612;8548048;Growth hormone receptor: structure and signal transduction.;"The growth hormone receptor (GHR) belongs to the superfamily of transmembrane proteins that includes the prolactin receptor and a number of cytokine receptors. Two forms exist for the GHR: the full-length membrane-bound human receptor is a protein of 620 amino acids with a single transmembrane region; and the GH binding protein (GHBP) is a short soluble from corresponding to the extracellular domain of the full-length receptor. In rodents, GHBP is encoded by a specific mRNA of 1.2-1.5 kb, whereas in man and other species GHBP is believed to result from proteolytic cleavage of the membrane receptor. Growth hormone binding protein prolongs the half-life of GH but other functions for GHBP remain to be demonstrated. Recombinant GHBP complexed to human GH shows a 2:1 stoichiometric crystal structure. Growth hormone-induced dimerization of the cell surface GHR appears to be a prerequisite for biological activity of the hormone. JAK2 has been identified as a tyrosine kinase associated with GHR and other receptors of the superfamily. Binding of GH to its receptor results in dimerization of the GHR, phosphorylation of JAK2 and of the GHR. Other substrates for JAK2 have to be identified. Transcription factors belonging to the STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcriptions) family are involved in the transcriptional effects of GH. The activity of mutants of the GHR has been measured in functional tests to identify sequences of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor that are important for signal transduction. A proline-rich sequence, called Box I, conserved among members of the receptor family has been shown to be crucial for GH effects on gene transcription. MAP kinase activity and cell proliferation. The C-terminal region of the GHR is required for tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor and for a hormonal effect on gene transcription, whereas only 46 membrane proximal amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain are necessary for activation of JAK2 and transduction of the GH proliferative signal. Much work remains to be done to identify other protein kinases and signalling molecules involved in the mechanism of action of GH. ";polyproline;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
613;9253601;A transcript map for the 2.8-Mb region containing the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 locus.;Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) is an inherited cancer syndrome in which affected individuals develop multiple parathyroid, enteropancreatic, and pituitary tumors. The locus for MEN1 is tightly linked to the marker PYGM on chromosome 11q13, and linkage analysis places the MEN1 gene within a 2-Mb interval flanked by the markers D11S1883 and D11S449. Loss of heterozygosity studies in MEN 1 and sporadic tumors suggest that the MEN1 gene encodes a tumor suppressor and have helped to narrow the location of the gene to a 600-kb interval between PYGM and D11S449. Focusing on this smaller MEN1 interval, we have identified and mapped 12 transcripts to this 600-kb region. A precise ordered map of 33 transcripts, including 12 genes known to map to this region, was generated for the 2.8-Mb D11S480-D11S913 interval.

To investigate the possible therapeutic potential of triplex-forming oligos in HER2 overexpressing breast cancers, we have studied the ability of triplex formation to compete with and to inhibit the binding of a transcription factor to its consensus sequence at an adjacent site. Competition binding assays demonstrate that a triplex-forming oligo can inhibit transcription factor binding in a sequence-specific manner. Moreover, we find that the addition of both nucleotide and non-nucleotide 'tails' to triplex-forming oligos do not confer any enhancement of binding affinity, but provide additional inhibition of transcription factor binding, potentially by steric hindrance.;polythreonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

618;6182410;Response of peripheral collateral arteries in the dog to prostaglandins E1, E2, F2 alpha, and I2 (prostacyclin).;Prostaglandins (PG) E2, E2, E2 alpha, and I2 [prostacyclin (PGI2)] were tested in vitro on collateral arteries that enlarge following chronic occlusion of the femoral artery in the dog. After contraction with an ED50 dose of KCl, serial doses of a PG were added. Collateral arteries relaxed significantly to PGI2 (10(-7)--10(-5) M). Normal, similarly sized branch arteries did not relax. The contractile response of collateral arteries to PGE1, PGE2, and PGF2 alpha was qualitatively similar to that of branch arteries, but the magnitude of the responses for collateral arteries was PGF2 alpha = PGE2 greater than PGE1. The magnitude of the response for branch arteries was PGF2 alpha much greater than PGE2 greater than PGE1. The effects of the PGs on anterior tibial arteries from the contralateral limb and on anterior tibial arteries exposed to low pressure below the occlusion did not differ. Thus the lowered pressure in the limb with the occluded femoral artery was not responsible for differences in the effects of the PGs on collateral arteries. Collateral arteries are more sensitive to the relaxant effects of PGI2 in high doses and are less sensitive to the contractile effects of other PGs, particularly PGF2 alpha, than similarly sized arteries. This suggests that therapeutic doses of PGI2 may increase blood flow to ischemic areas.;-;-;-;hard_0
619;9734151;CCR5 chemokine receptor genotype frequencies among Puerto Rican HIV-1-seropositive individuals.;"Some individuals remain uninfected by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), despite multiple sexual contacts with subjects with confirmed HIV-1 infection. Several studies have confirmed that individuals who are homozygous for a 32 base pair (bp) deletion mutation in the chemokine receptor gene CCR5, designated as delta 32/ delta 32, are protected against HIV-1 infection. Heterozygotes of the same chemokine receptor deletion mutation are, however, not protected from acquiring HIV-1 infection but seemingly have slower progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndromes (AIDS). Genotype frequencies of the delta 32 CCR5 mutation vary markedly among different ethnic groups; heterozygosity is found in approximately 15% of Caucasians, about 5-7% of Hispanics and African Americans and 1% or less of Asians. The ethnic background of Puerto Ricans is highly complex and usually includes admixture of Caucasian, Caribbean Indian and African traits to a varying extent. This study was conducted to examine the frequencies of the delta 32 CCR5 mutation among Puerto Ricans who are infected with HIV-1. Samples were received from different geographical regions of the island. Of 377 samples tested, 94.2% were wild type (non-deletion mutant) homozygotes, 5.8% were delta 32 CCR5 heterozygotes, and none were delta 32 CCR5 homozygotes.

620;10091854;Cadmium: a possible etiological factor in peripheral polyneuropathy.;Uncovering the exact cause of polyneuropathies seems to be impossible in up to 24% of the cases. Experimental studies have shown that cadmium (Cd), which is a well-known occupational and environmental hazard, can be a potent neurotoxicant for the peripheral nervous system. Moreover, Cd has a half-life of more than 15 years in humans. We hypothesize that older workers may be more susceptible to an increased Cd body burden, and may develop a peripheral polyneuropathy (PNP) over time. A blinded epidemiological survey was performed in 13 retired, long-term Cd-exposed workers and 19 age-matched controls. Historical Cd biomonitoring data were available over the last two decades. A neurological clinical examination, nerve conduction studies, and needle EMG were performed, and a standardized questionnaire was given to evaluate polyneuropathy complaints. If two of the following four criteria, i.e. complaints of polyneuropathy, neurophysiological changes compatible with polyneuropathy, distal symmetrical areflexia, or distal symmetrical anesthesia for vibration sense, temperature or blunt-sharp discrimination were present, the diagnosis of PNP was made. Two (11%) of the control and seven (54%) of the retired Cd workers met the PNP criteria OR: 9.92 (95%CI 1.60-61.6), Fisher exact test p=0.015. The existence of a polyneuropathy was related to the level of the Cd body burden as reflected by urinary Cd multiple logistic regression p=0.016, OR=1.26, (95%CI, 1.04-1.51), but not to blood lead (p=0.352). Our findings favour the hypothesis of a promoting role of increased cadmium body burden in the development of PNP at older age.;-;-;-;hard_0
621;9405290;Characterization of the regulatory regions in the human desmoglein genes encoding the pemphigus foliaceous and pemphigus vulgaris antigens.;The adhesive proteins in the desmosome type of cell junction consist of two members of the cadherin superfamily, the desmogleins and desmocollins. Both desmogleins and desmocollins occur as at least three different isoforms with various patterns of expression. The molecular mechanisms controlling the differential expression of the desmosomal cadherin isoforms are not yet known. We have begun an investigation of desmoglein gene expression by cloning and analysing the promoters of the human genes coding for the type 1 and type 3 desmogleins (DSG1 and DSG3). The type 1 isoform is restricted to the suprabasal layers of the epidermis and is the autoantigen in the autoimmune blistering skin disease pemphigus foliaceous. The type 3 desmoglein isoform is also expressed in the epidermis, but in lower layers than the type 1 isoform, and is the autoantigen in pemphigus vulgaris. Phage lambda genomic clones were obtained containing 4.2 kb upstream of the translation start site of DSG1 and 517 bp upstream of the DSG3 start site. Sequencing of 660 bp upstream of DSG1 and 517 bp upstream of DSG3 revealed that there was no obvious TATA box, but a possible CAAT box was present at -238 in DSG1 and at -193 in DSG3 relative to the translation start site. Primer extension analysis and RNase protection experiments revealed four putative transcription initiation sites for DSG1 at positions -163, -151, -148 and -141, and seven closely linked sites for DSG3, the longest being at -140 relative to the translation start site. The sequences at these possible sites at -166 to -159 in DSG1 (TTCAGTCC) and at -124 to -117 in DSG3 (CTTAGACT) have some similarity to the initiator sequence (CTCANTCT) described for a TATA-less promoter often from -3 to +5, and the true transcription initiator site might therefore be the A residue in these sequences. There were two regions of similarity between the DSG1 and DSG3 promoters just upstream of the transcription initiation sites, of 20 and 13 bp, separated by 41 bp in DSG1 and 36 bp in DSG3. The significance of these regions of similarity remains to be elucidated, but the results suggest that they represent a point at which these two desmoglein genes are co-ordinately regulated. Analysis of the upstream sequences revealed GC-rich regions and consensus binding sites for transcription factors including AP-1 and AP-2. Exon boundaries were conserved compared with the classical cadherin E-cadherin, but the equivalent of the second cadherin intron was lacking. A 4.2 kb region of the human DSG1 promoter sequence was linked to the lacZ gene reporter gene in such a way that there was only one translation start site, and this construct was used to generate transgenic mice. We present the first transgenic analysis of a promoter region taken from a desmosomal cadherin gene. Our results suggest that the 4.2 kb upstream region of DSG1 does not contain all the regulatory elements necessary for correct expression of this gene but might have elements that regulate activity during hair growth. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
623;9823752;Inefficient postural responses to unexpected slips during walking in older adults.;"BACKGROUND
Slips account for a high percentage of falls and subsequent injuries in community-dwelling older adults but not in young adults. This phenomenon suggests that although active and healthy older adults preserve a mobility level comparable to that of young adults, these older adults may have difficulty generating efficient reactive postural responses when they slip. This study tested the hypothesis that active and healthy older adults use a less effective reactive balance strategy than young adults when experiencing an unexpected forward slip occurring at heel strike during walking. This less effective balance strategy would be manifested by slower and smaller postural responses, altered temporal and spatial organization of the postural responses, and greater upper trunk instability after the slip.


METHODS
Thirty-three young adults (age range=19-34 yrs, mean=25+/-4 yrs) and 32 community-dwelling older adults (age range=70-87 yrs, mean=74+/-14 yrs) participated. Subjects walked across a movable forceplate which simulated a forward slip at heel strike. Surface electromyography was recorded from bilateral leg, thigh, hip, and trunk muscles. Kinematic data were collected from the right (perturbed) side of the body.


RESULTS
Although the predominant postural muscles and the activation sequence of these muscles were similar between the two age groups, the postural responses of older adults were of longer onset latencies, smaller magnitudes, and longer burst durations compared to young adults. Older adults also showed a longer coactivation duration for the ankle, knee, and trunk agonist/antagonist pairs on the perturbed side and for the knee agonist/antagonist pair on the nonperturbed side. Behaviorally, older adults became less stable after the slips. This was manifested by a higher incidence of being tripped (21 trials in older vs 5 trials in young adults) and a greater trunk hyperextension with respect to young adults. Large arm elevation was frequently used by older adults to assist in maintaining trunk stability. In an attempt to quickly reestablish the base of support after the slips, older adults had an earlier contralateral foot strike and shortened stride length.


CONCLUSION
The combination of slower onset and smaller magnitude of postural responses to slips in older adults resulted in an inefficient balance strategy. Older adults needed secondary compensatory adjustments, including a lengthened response duration and the use of the arms, to fully regain balance and prevent a fall. The shorter stride length and earlier contralateral foot strike following the slip indicate use of a more conservative balance strategy in older adults.";-;-;-;hard_0

To study intake stimulants in plants, chemical components of perennial ryegrass were extracted, fractionated, and examined for their effects on the feeding behavior of sheep. Methanol extracts were found to be stimulants, and pentane extracts tended to be deterrents. The ethyl acetate fraction of the methanol extracts stimulated feeding, and the basic ethyl acetate-soluble fractions of the methanol extracts were bioactive.

629;2521675;The p53 complex from monkey cells modulates the biochemical activities of simian virus 40 large T antigen.;We have compared the ATPase, DNA-binding, and helicase activities of free simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen (To) and T antigen complexed with cellular p53 (T+p53). Each activity is essential for productive viral infection. The T+p53 and To fractions were prepared by sequential immunosorption of infected monkey cells with monoclonal antibodies specific for p53 and T antigen. The immune-complexed T fractions were then assayed in parallel. For ATP hydrolysis, the Vmax for T+p53 was 143 nmol of ADP per min per mg of protein, or 18-fold greater than for To. ATP had no effect on the stability of the T+p53 complex. The T+p53 complex was significantly more active than To in hydrolyzing dATP, dGTP, GTP, and UTP. Of the nucleotide substrates tested, the greatest relative increase (T+p53/To) was in hydrolyzing dGTP and GTP. In DNase footprinting assays performed under replication conditions, the T+p53 complex protected regions I, II, and III of origin DNA while equivalent amounts of To protected only regions I and II. Region III is known to contribute to the efficiency of DNA replication and contains the SP1-binding sites of the early viral promoter. The T+p53 fraction was also a more efficient helicase than To, especially with a GC-rich primer and template. Thus, the T+p53 complex has enhanced ATPase, GTPase, DNA-binding, and helicase activities. These findings imply that complex formation between cellular monkey p53 and SV40 T antigen modulates a number of essential activities of T in SV40 productive infection. ;polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
630;9722596;Glucocorticoids repress transcription from a negative glucocorticoid response element recognized by two homeodomain-containing proteins, Pbx and Oct-1.;Several studies have established that the prolactin (PRL) gene is expressed not only in lactotrophs and somatotrophs of the anterior pituitary but, albeit to a lesser extent, in non-pituitary cells like human thymocytes, decidualized endometrium, mammary glands during lactation, and some human non-pituitary cell lines. Despite the requirement in the pituitary for the pituitary-specific transcription factor Pit-1/GHF-1 for PRL expression, the expression in non-pituitary cells occurs in the absence of Pit-1/GHF-1 and can be repressed by glucocorticoids. This prompted us to investigate the transcription factors in non-pituitary cells which are involved in controlling expression and glucocorticoid repression of a previously characterized negative glucocorticoid response element from the bovine prolactin gene (PRL3 nGRE). Here we have demonstrated that non-pituitary cells (COS-7 and mouse hepatoma Hepa1c1c7 cells) conferred increased expression via the PRL3 nGRE mainly because of the binding of the ubiquitously expressed POU-homeodomain-containing octamer transcription factor-1 (Oct-1) to an AT-rich sequence present in the PRL3 sequence. However, full transcriptional activity required the binding of a second ubiquitously expressed homeodomain-containing protein, Pbx, previously shown to bind cooperatively with several homeotic selector proteins. The Pbx binding site in the PRL3 nGRE, located just upstream of the Oct-1 binding site, showed a strong sequence similarity with known Pbx binding sites and bound Pbx with an affinity similar to that of other established Pbx target sequences. Interestingly, both Oct-1 and Pbx binding to the PRL3 nGRE were found to be required for glucocorticoid repression. Addition of in vitro translated glucocorticoid receptor DNA binding domain to the nuclear extract prevented Oct-1 and Pbx from binding to the PRL element. The involvement of the homeobox protein Pbx in glucocorticoid repression via an nGRE identifies a new role for this protein.;polythreonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

Cells containing an active recombinant provirus were cloned and expanded. Nucleic acid analysis revealed approximately one intact provirus per cell. Viral RNA levels were different for each cell clone examined [between 0.05% and 0.5% of the poly(A)+ RNA], and transcription was initiated and terminated in the long terminal repeats as in permissive differentiated cells. The cells retained an undifferentiated phenotype and remained positive for stage-specific embryonic antigen 1 and negative for H-2 surface antigens. The cells retained the block to the expression of other proviruses integrated at other chromosomal locations. The data suggest that a cis-acting genetic element, at or near the chromosomal site of integration, or mutations in the viral control elements themselves may be responsible for provirus expression in these cells. ;polyalanine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

Fourier transform infrared and laser Raman difference spectroscopy were used to establish correlations between spectral changes and drug binding mode, sequence selectivity, DNA conformation, and structural properties of DES.DNA complexes in aqueous solution. Spectroscopic results indicated that DES is a weak intercalator with affinity for A-T-rich regions. It is also a groove binder with a major interaction with the thymine O-2 atom. At low drug concentration (r = 1:40), the A-T-rich region is the main target of drug intercalation, while at a higher drug content (r > 1:5), external binding to the G-C bases also occurs with a partial helix destabilization. Evidence for this comes from the spectral alterations of the A-T vibrational frequencies at 1661 cm-1 (Raman) and 1663 and 1609 cm-1 (IR) and of the G-C vibrations at 1581 and 1491 cm-1 (Raman) and 1717 and 1492 cm-1 (IR).

In support of a study to develop mitotane analogs as more effective therapeutic agents and as a basis for understanding the toxicity of related compounds in the adrenals, the biotransformations of o,p'-DDD in adrenocortical homogenate preparations have been studied and compared with those of its m,p'- and p,p'-isomers. Aliphatic oxidation to the corresponding acetic acid derivative, o,p'-, m,p'- or p,p'-DDA, was the major transformation for all the preparations. In the comparisons of the DDD isomers, the order of both DDA formation and apparent covalent binding was o,p'- > m,p'- > p,p'-DDD. There was also evidence for alpha-hydroxylation at the benzylic carbon with subsequent loss of water to form ethylene derivatives. This was a minor pathway for o,p'-DDD, but was the major pathway for the other two isomers. Thus, while the total yields of metabolites of o,p'- and m,p'-DDD were similar and at least twice that of the p,p'-isomer, their distribution of metabolites differed significantly. The effects of the three isomers on cell growth and cortisol production with the human adrenocortical carcinoma cell line, NCI H-295, followed the same order as their DDA formation and tissue binding. It is proposed that hydroxylation by the adrenal cortex at the beta-carbon leads to an adrenalytic effect, whereas hydroxylation at the alpha-carbon would represent an alternate deactivation pathway.;-;-;-;hard_0
638;3032648;Interactions between hepatitis B virus and polymeric human albumin. I. Production of monoclonal anti-idiotypes (anti-anti-polymeric human albumin) which recognize hepatitis B virus surface antigen.;In an attempt to characterize the polymeric human albumin (polyHSA) receptor expressed on hepatitis B virus and hepatocytes, we have used a human anti-polyHSA IgG to generate monoclonal anti-idiotypes (anti-Id) which bear the internal image of polyHSA and mimic its binding activity. Two monoclonal anti-Id antibodies, 63.14 and 70.F9, were strongly reactive in both radioimmunoassay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with the F(ab')2 of the immunogen as well as with purified hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) expressing various subtypes. The specificity of the binding of anti-Id to HBsAg was confirmed in direct ELISA and by Western blot analysis. These experiments also showed that the anti-Id bind to a site expressed on the major 24-kDa protein of HBsAg particles, and that this recognition is specifically inhibited by polyHSA. Experiments on cellular staining and radioimmunoprecipitation on HBsAg-positive and -negative cell lines showed that the anti-Id recognize intracellular HBsAg but not other liver cell proteins, including the putative polyHSA receptor. These data indicate, therefore, that the monoclonal anti-Id mimic the binding activity of polyHSA and recognize its binding site on the virus. The inability of both anti-Id to react with the hepatocyte surface suggests either the absence of a specific hepatic polyHSA receptor or the expression of one with a different configuration.;polyhistidine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

All patients had 170-kDa amebic antigen in serum, compared with 1 of 50 cyst passers and 1 of 31 controls (P < .01). Seven days after treatment, serum and fecal 170-kDa antigen became undetectable in 12 of the 13 patients (P < .001). Serum anti-LC3 IgA was found in 83.8% of colitis patients, compared with 2% of controls and 12% of asymptomatic cyst passers (P < .001). Salivary and fecal anti-LC3 IgA levels were higher in patients than in cyst passers (P < .001).

642;1848986;Tissue-specific expression of p53 in transgenic mice is regulated by intron sequences.;Transgenic mice were produced harboring the p53 murine cDNA clone regulated by the SV40 enhancer-promoter region 5' to the cDNA and the small t antigen splice sites, and poly(A) addition signals 3' to the cDNA. This construction was not expressed in these mice. The presence of several murine p53 introns in the cDNA, however, permitted expression of the transgene mRNA in several tissues of transgenic mice. The insertion of intron 4 led to the preferential expression of the transgene mRNA in spleen cells, where the endogenous p53 gene is also expressed at high levels. While intron 4 promoted high levels of p53 mRNA expression in a tissue-preferred manner in transgenic mice, there was no evidence that intron 4 could act as an enhancer of transcription in cell culture or in transgenic animals. The presence of some p53 introns appears to be critical for the regulation of this gene in vivo.; polyalanine ;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
645;8641186;Effect of constant light on fetal and maternal prolactin rhythms in sheep.;A 24-h rhythm of plasma PRL is present in fetal sheep. This rhythm is synchronized to an environmental clue (zeitgeber). We determined whether the light-dark cycle (L:D) is a zeitgeber for the fetal PRL rhythm and, if so, whether the mother might convey this zeitgeber to the fetus. We kept nine ewes (twin pregnancies) in constant light (L:L) and five ewes (singleton) in 14:10 L:D from 110 days gestation. Fetuses and mothers were catheterized at 119 days gestation. Blood samples were taken hourly for 24 h after 16 days under L:L or L:D. A mean 24-h rhythm of PRL was found (by RIA) in fetuses under L:D, but not in those under L:L. However, fetuses under L:L showed individual 24-h PRL rhythms (cosinor analysis) whose acrophases were distributed around the clock. Nonsynchronized rhythms persisted after 23 and 30 days of L:L. Acrophases of PRL rhythms within a set of twins were closer than those between sets, suggesting that twins were responding to a common signal. These findings indicate that the L:D cycle is a zeitgeber for the PRL rhythm in fetal sheep and suggest that the mother might convey the zeitgeber.;-;-;-;hard_0
646;36436609;VaBAM1 weakens cold tolerance by interacting with the negative regulator VaSR1 to suppress β-amylase expression.;"Cold stress is a key climatic factor that limits grape productivity and quality. Although β-amylase (BAM) is known to play an important role as a mediator of starch degradation under conditions of cold stress, the mechanism by which BAM regulates cold tolerance in grape remains unclear. Here, we identified VaBAM1 from Vitis amurensis and characterized its interactive regulating mechanism under cold stress in Arabidopsis thaliana and grape. VaBAM1-overexpressing A. thaliana plants (OEs) exhibited high freezing tolerance. Soluble sugar content and amylase activity were increased in OEs and VaBAM1-overexpressing grape calli (VaBAM1-OEs) under cold stress; however, they were decreased in grape calli in which VaBAM1 was edited using CRISPR/Cas9. The results of yeast two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and pull-down experiments showed that serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (VaSR1) interacted with VaBAM1. Furthermore, the expression of VaSR1 was opposite that of VaBAM1 in phloem tissue of Vitis amurensis during winter dormancy. In VaSR1-overexpressing grape calli (VaSR1-OEs), BAM activity and the expression levels of C-repeat binding transcription factor and cold response genes were all significantly lower than that in untransformed calli subjected to cold stress. Moreover, VvBAM1 was downregulated in VaSR1-OEs under cold stress. Overall, we identified that VaSR1 interacts with VaBAM1, negatively regulating BAM activity and resulting in decreased plant cold tolerance.";polyarginine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
647;28805565;Noninvasive Brain Stimulation and Implications for Nonmotor Symptoms in Parkinson's Disease.;Transcranial noninvasive brain stimulation includes both repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). TMS uses a rapidly changing magnetic field to induce currents and action potentials in underlying brain tissue, whereas tDCS involves the application of weak electrical currents to modulate neuronal membrane potential. In this chapter, we provide a literature review with a focus on the therapeutic potential of both techniques in the treatment of nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). On the whole, the results of studies are rather preliminary but promising as they show some positive effects of rTMS and tDCS particularly on depressive symptoms and cognitive dysfunctions in PD.

650;7580022;Second polar body extrusion is highly predictive for oocyte fertilization as soon as 3 hr after intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).;"OBJECTIVE
Our objective was to evaluate the time course and the predictive value of the extrusion of the second polar body after intracytoplasmic injection (ICSI) related to the fertilization rate, embryo cleavage and quality.


SETTING
The setting was the in vitro fertilization program of a university hospital.


PATIENTS
Twenty-one patients were treated with intracytoplasmic single sperm injection either for fertilization failure in IVF, low fertilization in IVF (< 5%), or severe male factors.


DESIGN
One hundred thirty-five of 205 metaphase 2 oocytes treated with intracytoplasmic single sperm injection were observed 1, 2, and 3 hr after the assisted fertilization procedure. Extrusion of the second polar body was recorded. For each of these oocytes, fertilization was noted 18 hr after ICSI and cleavage and embryo quality were assessed 24 hr later. The 70 remaining oocytes were used to assess a possible negative effect of repeated exposure to light microscopy.


RESULTS
The extrusion of the second polar body 3 hr after injection was an observation with a sensitivity of 0.87, a specificity of 0.58, and a high positive predictive value (0.90) toward oocyte fertilization. Twenty-nine and four-tenths percent of the oocytes extruded a second polar body within the first hour, 56.6% within the first 2 hr, and 78.3% had a second polar body 3 hr after injection. This time course was related neither to the speed of embryo cleavage nor to the embryo quality. Fertilization, cleavage, and embryo quality were not affected by repeated observation as deduced from comparison with the control group and confirmed by a high pregnancy (62% per oocyte retrieval) and implantation rate (22% per replaced embryo).


CONCLUSION
Oocytes can be checked, in all safety, 3 hr after a single sperm injection for the presence of a second polar to predict oocyte fertilization with a high certainty.";-;-;-;hard_0

In normolipemic volunteers, excretion of mevalonic acid averaged 3.51 +/- 0.59 (SD) micrograms/kg x day1; (n = 24) and was not different from patients with hypercholesterolemia (3.30 +/- 0.92 micrograms/kg x day1; n = 24). In patients with cerebrotendineous xanthomatosis, the excretion was significantly higher (8.55 +/- 1.92 micrograms/kg x day1; n = 6, P < 0.001) but comparable to volunteers treated with cholestyramine (6.69 +/- 2.6 micrograms/kg x day1; n = 5). A significant correlation was found between 24-h excretion of mevalonic acid and cholesterol synthesis (r = 0.835; n = 35; P < 0.001). The coefficient of variation of excretion of mevalonic acid during 3 consecutive days was small (9.8%; n = 7). However, urinary output of mevalonic acid was significantly higher during the night (164 +/- 14 micrograms/12-h) than during the day (129 +/- 9 micrograms/12-h; n = 11; P < 0.05). In patients treated with simvastatin (40 mg/day) for 6 weeks, the ratio of mevalonic acid to creatinine in a morning urine sample decreased significantly compared to pretreatment values (110 +/- 25 micrograms/g vs. 66 +/- 25 micrograms/g; P < 0.001). Furthermore, the ratio of mevalonic acid to creatinine in a morning urine sample correlated with the ratio from the 24-h collection period (r = 0.714; n = 34; P < 0.001). The results indicate that the analysis of urinary mevalonic acid, either in 24-h collection or in a single morning sample, is an attractive method for evaluation of long and very short term changes of the rates of cholesterol synthesis.";-;-;-;hard_0
652;27314325;Topoisomerase II Inhibitors Can Enhance Baculovirus-Mediated Gene Expression in Mammalian Cells through the DNA Damage Response.;BacMam is an insect-derived recombinant baculovirus that can deliver genes into mammalian cells. BacMam vectors carrying target genes are able to enter a variety of cell lines by endocytosis, but the level of expression of the transgene depends on the cell line and the state of the transduced cells. In this study, we demonstrated that the DNA damage response (DDR) could act as an alternative pathway to boost the transgene(s) expression by BacMam and be comparable to the inhibitors of histone deacetylase. Topoisomerase II (Top II) inhibitor-induced DDR can enhance the CMV-IE/enhancer mediated gene expression up to 12-fold in BacMam-transduced U-2OS cells. The combination of a Top II inhibitor, VM-26, can also augment the killing efficiency of a p53-expressing BacMam vector in U-2OS osteosarcoma cells.

Besides the cerebral cortex, we found that Satb2 is specifically expressed in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, horizontal limb of the diagonal band, lateral hypothalamic area, arcuate nucleus, hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, ventral tegmental nucleus, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, dorsal raphe nucleus, rostral periolivary region, and parabrachial nucleus. Double immunostaining showed that Satb2 is exclusively expressed in the excitatory neurons of neocortex. In addition, Satb2 is specifically expressed in A12 group of hypothalamic dopaminergic neurons and in serotonergic neurons in the dorsal part of the dorsal raphe nucleus. Our results present a comprehensive overview of Satb2 expression in the adult brain and provide insights for studying the role of Satb2 in the mature CNS. ;polythreonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

662;8759251;Melatonin prevents ischemia reperfusion injury in hamster cheek pouch microcirculation.;"OBJECTIVE
We used the hamster cheek pouch microcirculation to investigate the effects of melatonin (ME) on ischemia reperfusion (I-R) injury by in vivo microscopy. ME is a hormone produced by the pineal gland and is the most powerful and effective hydroxyl radical scavenger detected to date in vitro. The second aim was to determine the scavenger effect of ME in cheek pouch microcirculation when topically applying an oxygen-derived free radical generating system.


METHODS
Ischemia was induced by clamping the cheek pouch for 30 min followed by 30 min of reperfusion. We quantified the increase in permeability, the perfused capillary length and leukocyte adhesion by computerized methods. Microcirculation was also exposed to a hypoxanthine-xanthine oxidase (H-X) system.


RESULTS
In control hamsters I-R was associated with increased permeability, increased number of leukocytes sticking to venules, and decreased perfused capillary length. Treatment with ME completely inhibited microvascular edema formation and reduced the number of leukocytes sticking to venules after reperfusion. Moreover, ME prevented the marked decrease in perfused capillary length, preserving microvascular perfusion. ME topically applied reduced significantly the permeability increase due to H-X exposure.


CONCLUSIONS
The beneficial effect of ME may be related to its antioxidant properties. These protect the endothelial barrier integrity as well as preserve microvascular blood perfusion by dysfunctions after I-R.";-;-;-;hard_0
664;8934550;Development of mammary and cutaneous gland tumors in transgenic mice carrying the RET/PTC1 oncogene.;"RET/PTC1 is a chimeric oncogene created by the fusion of the tyrosine kinase domain of RET to the 5'-terminal region of another gene named H4. So far, this oncogene has been found activated only in human papillary thyroid carcinomas. In order to investigate its transforming properties in vivo, we have produced transgenic mice carrying RET/PTC1 under the control of the H4 promoter. The transgene was expressed in several tissues, consistently with the ubiquitous expression of the wild type H4 gene. Mammary adenocarcinomas and, less frequently, hyperplasia of sebaceous glands and rare benign skin tumors, named pilomatrixomas, developed in these mice. The tumors were shown to express the transgene both at the RNA and protein level. These results demonstrate that the transforming ability of the RET/PTC1 oncogene is not restricted to the thyroid epithelium in vivo. Despite its ubiquitous expression, however, RET/PTC1 was able to induce only a limited number of tumor types; specifically mammary epithelium was affected by transgene expression, thus suggesting that RET/PTC1 is able to couple with transforming pathways specific for these glandular cells.";-;-;-;hard_0

However, recent work has shown that zyxin/paxillin family proteins also shuttle through the nucleus. These proteins may enter the nucleus by association with other proteins, but are exported from the nucleus by means of intrinsic leucine-rich nuclear export sequences. Zyxin/paxillin proteins may regulate gene transcription by interaction with transcription factors. In some cases, misregulation of nuclear functions of zyxin/paxillin proteins appear to be associated with pathogenic effects. ;polyleucine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

I believe in ilio-tibial band (ITB)-related LET to restrain anterolateral rotatory instability (ALRI) in ACL that is injured and reconstructed, and not in the ""anterolateral ligament"" or related techniques. However, the potential for conflict of a modified Lemaire LET femoral tunnel with an ACL femoral tunnel is higher than appreciated, and it risks iatrogenic ACL graft damage or compromised fixation. For MacIntosh LET, I use a staple to fix a strip of ITB (left attached distally to Gerdy's tubercle) at the lateral femoral metaphysis. The tines of the staple are proximal to the ACL femoral tunnel and fixation, so conflict cannot occur. For modified Lemaire LET, the ITB graft is (taken deep to the LCL and) attached at ""Lemaire's point"" on the lateral femur (proximal and posterior to the LCL femoral attachment). For fixation, I use a 15-mm length suture anchor, sufficiently short to avoid conflict. I presume fixation is less strong with sutures, so the 2-3 cm of ITB graft proximal to the suture are turned distally back over the LCL and sutured to itself. This does create a thickened contour to the lateral knee, but excellent clinical outcomes. Finally, I recommend the anteromedial bundle (AMB) position for the femoral tunnel, as in my experience in professional soccer players, using the central ""anatomic"" position increases rates of ACL graft rerupture. Moreover, ""anatomic"" femoral tunnel position results in a flatter trajectory increasing the risk of conflict with a LET tunnel (or lateral physical damage in patients with open growth plates).";-;-;-;hard_0
678;1373374;Heterodimerization between light-regulated and ubiquitously expressed Arabidopsis GBF bZIP proteins.;The promoters of a variety of plant genes are characterized by the presence of a G-box (CCACGTGG) or closely related DNA motifs. These genes often exhibit quite diverse expression characteristics and in many cases the G-box sequence has been demonstrated to be essential for expression. The G-box of the Arabidopsis rbcS-1A gene is bound by a protein, GBF, identified in plant nuclear extracts. Here we report the isolation of three Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA clones encoding GBF proteins referred to as GBF1, GBF2 and GBF3. GBF1 and GBF2 mRNA is present in light and dark grown leaves as well as in roots. In contrast, GBF3 mRNA is found mainly in dark grown leaves and in roots. The deduced amino acid sequences of the three cDNAs indicate that each encodes a basic/leucine zipper protein. In addition, all three proteins are characterized by an N-terminal proline-rich domain. Homodimers of the three proteins specifically recognize the G-box motif, with GBF1 and GBF3 binding symmetrically to this palindromic sequence. In contrast, GBF2 binds to the symmetrical G-box sequence in such a way that the juxtaposition of the protein and the DNA element is clearly asymmetric and hence distinct from that observed for the other two proteins. The fact that GBF1, GBF2 and GBF3 possess both distinct DNA binding properties and expression characteristics prompt us to entertain the notion that these proteins may individually mediate distinct subclasses of expression properties assigned to the G-box. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GBF1, GBF2 and GBF3 heterodimerize and these heterodimers also interact with the G-box, suggesting a potential mechanism for generating additional diversity from these GBF proteins. ;polyproline;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

680;9149948;The human homolog of a mouse-imprinted gene, Peg3, maps to a zinc finger gene-rich region of human chromosome 19q13.4.;"Peg3 (paternally expressed gene 3) is the first imprinted gene detected in the proximal region of mouse chromosome 7. Because imprinting is a trait that is generally conserved among mammals, and imprinted domains generally encompass several adjacent genes, expression patterns and chromosomal environment of the human counterpart of Peg3 are of special interest. In this study we have localized human PEG3 approximately 2 Mb proximal of the telomere of chromosome 19q, within a region known to carry large numbers of tandemly clustered Kr�ppel-type zinc finger-containing (ZNF) genes. Peg3 also encodes a Kr�ppel-type ZNF protein but one that is distinguished from other ZNF gene products by the fact that it carries two novel proline-rich motifs. Comparison between mouse Peg3 and partial human PEG3 gene sequences revealed a high level of conservation between the two species, despite the fact that one of the two proline-rich repeats is absent from the human gene. Our data demonstrate that the human gene is expressed at highest levels in ovary and placenta; mouse Peg3, by contrast, is transcribed at highest levels in the adult brain. These comparative mapping, sequencing, and expression data provide the first clues to the potential activities of PEG3, and generate new tools to aid in the analysis of structure and function of a potentially new imprinted domain located in human chromosome 19q13.4 and mouse chromosome 7.

The structure, which is very similar to those of other SH3 domains, consists of two orthogonal, antiparallel up-down beta-sheets, with three variable loops and a 3(10) helix. Docking of the proline-rich peptide, 3BP1 on Grb2-N SH3, shows that the polyproline type II helix can bind the SH3 domain forming conserved hydrogen bonds between the main-chain carbonyl oxygens of Met4 and Pro7 of the proline-rich peptide and the reoriented side-chains of Trp36 and Asn51, respectively, and a hydrogen bond between the main-chain carbonyl of Leu8 of the proline rich peptide with the side-chain OH of Tyr52 of the Grb2-N SH3. The peptide side-chain binding occurs on the surface of SH3 domain at three major sites involving the side-chains of the residues in the hydrophobic patch (Tyr7, Phe9, Trp36, Phe47, Pro49 and Tyr52) and the RT-Src and n-Src loops of the SH3 domain. The proline-rich peptides could bind the Grb2-N SH3 in either orientation and maintain the key hydrogen bonds because of the pseudo-symmetry of the polyproline type II helix. However, for the mSos1 peptide a salt bridge can be formed between the arginine of the proline-rich peptide and the protein at Asp15, Glu16 and Glu31 only in one direction; this orientation seems to be strongly preferred. The conservatively varied RGD sequence motif (sometimes KGE or KGD) in SH3 domains might be involved in interactions at the cell membrane. ";polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function
682;8595868;Intracellular acidification does not account for inhibition of Saccharomyces cerevisiae growth in the presence of ethanol.;Intracellular acidification has been considered one of a number of mechanisms underlying the inhibition of growth and fermentation by ethanol in yeast. However, most of the studies on the effect of ethanol on yeast intracellular pH (pHi) were carried out by using unadapted cells to which ethanol was added. In this paper we show that the pHi of exponential cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae IGC 3507 III grown in a medium with glucose and inhibitory concentrations of ethanol only decreased to values below those in unstressed cells (6.9) for concentrations equal to or above 7% (v/v). Only at these supracritical levels (7-10% (v/v)) was pH homeostasis in ethanol-adapted yeast affected. This is consistent with the significant increase of plasma membrane permeability and decrease of plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase in comparison with the corresponding values in unstressed cells. These deleterious effects were only observed with those high concentrations of toxin. These results indicate that intracellular acidification does not account for inhibition of yeast growth in the presence of ethanol. In fact, growth was inhibited by ethanol concentrations (3-6% (v/v)) that did not lead to the decrease of pHi. Furthermore, even for supracritical concentrations, close to the maximal that allowed growth (10% (v/v)), the decrease of pHi was not important reaching, at the most, values of 6.5-6.6.;-;-;-;hard_0
684;10623738;The nuclear export signal within the E4orf6 protein of adenovirus type 5 supports virus replication and cytoplasmic accumulation of viral mRNA.;During the late phase of adenovirus infection, viral mRNA is efficiently transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm while most cellular mRNA species are retained in the nucleus. Two viral proteins, E1B-55 kDa and E4orf6, are both necessary for these effects. The E4orf6 protein of adenovirus type 5 binds and relocalizes E1B-55 kDa, and the complex of the two proteins was previously shown to shuttle continuously between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Nucleocytoplasmic transport of the complex is achieved by a nuclear export signal (NES) within E4orf6. Mutation of this signal sequence severely reduces the ability of the E1B-55 kDa-E4orf6 complex to leave the nucleus. Here, we examined the role of functional domains within E4orf6 during virus infection. E4orf6 or mutants derived from it were transiently expressed, followed by infection with recombinant adenovirus lacking the E4 region and determination of virus yield. An arginine-rich putative alpha helix near the carboxy terminus of E4orf6 contributes to E1B-55 kDa binding and relocalization as well as to the synthesis of viral DNA, mRNA, and proteins. Further mutational analysis revealed that mutation of the NES within E4orf6 considerably reduces its ability to support virus production. The same effect was observed when nuclear export was blocked with a competitor. Further, a functional NES within E4orf6 contributed to the efficiency of late virus protein synthesis and viral DNA replication, as well as total and cytoplasmic accumulation of viral late mRNA. Our data support the view that NES-mediated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling strongly enhances most, if not all, intracellular activities of E4orf6 during the late phase of adenovirus infection. ;polyarginine;helix;-;LCR_with_function

691;17410025;Primary lung cancer presenting with gastrointestinal tract involvement: clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical features in a series of 18 consecutive cases.;"Lung cancer initially manifesting as gastrointestinal (GI)-tract metastasis is exceedingly rare, representing a diagnostic challenge and a late-stage disease sign. The clinicopathologic characteristics of the largest series of lung carcinomas initially presenting with GI involvement were described, focusing on differential diagnosis and therapeutic options. Eighteen consecutive cases of lung cancer (11 surgical specimens and 7 biopsies) initially diagnosed on GI histologic samples were identified during routine pathologist practice. All cases were immunostained with thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), caudal-related homeobox 2 (CDX2), and cytokeratins 7 (CK7) and 20 (CK20). Clinical and radiological data were obtained in all cases. There were 10 women and 8 men with a mean age of 68.5 years. The small bowel was the most common GI involved site (12 cases), followed by the stomach (four) and large intestine (two). Only half of cases were correctly diagnosed on GI biopsies. Fourteen patients died shortly from disease (mean follow-up, 3 months); two are still alive with multiple metastases, and two patients with the GI tract as the unique site of metastasis underwent pulmonary lobectomy and chemotherapy and are alive without evidence of disease. At morphology, there were 10 large cell undifferentiated carcinomas and eight adenocarcinomas. All cases were immunostained for CK7 and 89% for TTF-1, whereas CK20 and CDX2 were completely negative. Lung cancer presenting as GI-tract metastasis is probably more frequent than expected, and pathologists should always keep in mind this possibility when dealing with undifferentiated GI carcinoma. Immunostaining with TTF-1, CDX2, CK7, and CK20 is helpful in highlighting lung primary. Although GI metastasis from lung cancer is associated with dismal outcomes, pulmonary resection coupled with chemotherapy might represent a therapeutic option in selected patients with a solitary GI-tract metastasis.

696;35139225;The CCCH zinc finger protein C3H15 negatively regulates cell elongation by inhibiting brassinosteroid signaling.;Plant CCCH proteins participate in the control of multiple developmental and adaptive processes, but the regulatory mechanisms underlying these processes are not well known. In this study, we showed that the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) CCCH protein C3H15 negatively regulates cell elongation by inhibiting brassinosteroid (BR) signaling. Genetic and biochemical evidence showed that C3H15 functions downstream of the receptor BR INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1) as a negative regulator in the BR pathway. C3H15 is phosphorylated by the GLYCOGEN SYNTHASE KINASE 3 -like kinase BR-INSENSITIVE 2 (BIN2) at Ser111 in the cytoplasm in the absence of BRs. Upon BR perception, C3H15 transcription is enhanced, and the phosphorylation of C3H15 by BIN2 is reduced. The dephosphorylated C3H15 protein accumulates in the nucleus, where C3H15 regulates transcription via G-rich elements (typically GGGAGA). C3H15 and BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT 1 (BZR1)/BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR 1 (BES1), two central transcriptional regulators of BR signaling, directly suppress each other and share a number of BR-responsive target genes. Moreover, C3H15 antagonizes BZR1 and BES1 to regulate the expression of their shared cell elongation-associated target gene, SMALL AUXIN-UP RNA 15 (SAUR15). This study demonstrates that C3H15-mediated BR signaling may be parallel to, or even attenuate, the dominant BZR1 and BES1 signaling pathways to control cell elongation. This finding expands our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying BR-induced cell elongation in plants.;polyglycine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
701;3113332;A novel immunoassay system and bioseparation process based on thermal phase separating polymers.;Poly-N-isopropylacrylamide (polyNIPAAm), a water-soluble, thermally precipitating synthetic polymer, has been conjugated together with a monoclonal antibody (MAb) and utilized in a novel separation method for an immunoassay. The PolyNIPAAm precipitates out of water above a critical temperature of 31 degres C, enabling a polymer-bound immune complex to be separated from the solution. The principal advantages of this method are that it utilizes a homogeneous incubation for the antigen-antibody reaction, plus, it has the ability to assay large-molecular-weight antigens with sensitivities equivalent to other nonisotopic heterogeneous immunoassays. In addition, since the polymer-immune complex may be reversibly redissolved by cooling, the method may be used both to concentrate the signal and isolate the analyte. This general technique may also be used for a wide variety of separation processes in addition to immunoassays, in which a specific component in a biological fluid, industrial process stream, or body of water is to be isolated for analysis, recovery, or disposal. Thus, product recovery and/or toxin or pollutant removal processes are possible with this methodology. ;polyasparagine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
702;18987006;Reciprocal regulation of glycine-rich RNA-binding proteins via an interlocked feedback loop coupling alternative splicing to nonsense-mediated decay in Arabidopsis.;The Arabidopsis RNA-binding protein AtGRP8 undergoes negative autoregulation at the post-transcriptional level. An elevated AtGRP8 protein level promotes the use of a cryptic 5' splice site to generate an alternatively spliced transcript, as_AtGRP8, retaining the 5' half of the intron with a premature termination codon. In mutants defective in nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) abundance of as_AtGRP8 but not its pre-mRNA is elevated, indicating that as_AtGRP8 is a direct NMD target, thus limiting the production of functional AtGRP8 protein. In addition to its own pre-mRNA, AtGRP8 negatively regulates the AtGRP7 transcript through promoting the formation of the equivalent alternatively spliced as_AtGRP7 transcript, leading to a decrease in AtGRP7 abundance. Recombinant AtGRP8 binds to its own and the AtGRP7 pre-mRNA, suggesting that this interaction is relevant for the splicing decision in vivo. AtGRP7 itself is part of a negative autoregulatory circuit that influences circadian oscillations of its own and the AtGRP8 transcript through alternative splicing linked to NMD. Thus, we identify an interlocked feedback loop through which two RNA-binding proteins autoregulate and reciprocally crossregulate by coupling unproductive splicing to NMD. A high degree of evolutionary sequence conservation in the introns retained in as_AtGRP8 or as_AtGRP7 points to an important function of these sequences. ;polyglycine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
704;26939889;Structures of an all-α protein running along the DNA major groove.;Despite over 3300 protein-DNA complex structures have been reported in the past decades, there remain some unknown recognition patterns between protein and target DNA. The silkgland-specific transcription factor FMBP-1 from the silkworm Bombyx mori contains a unique DNA-binding domain of four tandem STPRs, namely the score and three amino acid peptide repeats. Here we report three structures of this STPR domain (termed BmSTPR) in complex with DNA of various lengths. In the presence of target DNA, BmSTPR adopts a zig-zag structure of three or four tandem α-helices that run along the major groove of DNA. Structural analyses combined with binding assays indicate BmSTPR prefers the AT-rich sequences, with each α-helix covering a DNA sequence of 4 bp. The successive AT-rich DNAs adopt a wider major groove, which is in complementary in shape and size to the tandem α-helices of BmSTPR. Substitutions of DNA sequences and affinity comparison further prove that BmSTPR recognizes the major groove mainly via shape readout. Multiple-sequence alignment suggests this unique DNA-binding pattern should be highly conserved for the STPR domain containing proteins which are widespread in animals. Together, our findings provide structural insights into the specific interactions between a novel DNA-binding protein and a unique deformed B-DNA. ;polythreonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
705;6125940;Pyrophosphate inhibition of rho ATPase: a mechanism of coupling to RNA polymerase activity.;The effects of pyrophosphate on RNA binding and ATPase activities of Escherichia coli transcription termination factor rho have been studied. Mutant rho-115 protein has a temperature-sensitive RNA-dependent ATPase activity due to the thermolability of binding to RNA [Kent, R.B. & Guterman, S.K. (1981) Fed. Proc. Fed. Am. Soc. Exp. Biol. 40, 1765 (abstr.)]. The presence of either ATP or pyrophosphate at comparable concentrations stabilizes the binary complex of rho and poly(C) at high temperature. ADP at 8-fold greater concentration also stabilizes the mutant rho-RNA binary complex. Pyrophosphate is a noncompetitive inhibitor (Ki = 0.07 mM) of rho poly(C)-dependent ATPase, an activity that is required for rho-mediated termination. These results suggest the existence of a regulatory site on the rho molecule. We suggest that rho NTPase is regulated by RNA polymerase (EC 2.7.7.6) so that during transcription elongation the RNA polymerase competes successfully with rho for substrates and inhibits rho NTPase with product pyrophosphate. Further, RNA polymerase pausing may result in reduced pyrophosphate and increased NTP concentrations, allowing rho NTPase to function.;polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

707;8006112;Detection of HIV-p24 antigen in body fluids by immunotrapping on Staphylococcus aureus (Cowan 1) bacteria, gold immunolabelling and backscattered electron analysis in a scanning electron microscope.;An immunosorbent electron microscopical (ISEM) method, the Protein A-coated bacteria technique/gold, (PA-CBT/G), was developed for the detection of non-particulate soluble antigens. The method is based on immunotrapping of antigens on antibody coated, glutaraldehyde cross-linked, Protein A-rich, Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. The 'trapped' antigen is then identified by colloidal-gold immunolabelling. Gold particles are observed in a scanning/transmission electron microscope by analysis of backscattered electrons. With this method it was possible to detect the presence of p24 HIV antigens in blood, semen, saliva, crevicular and cerebrospinal fluids from HIV seropositive cases. Although the PA-CBT/G identified correctly the p24 antigen in only 80% of the ELISA HIV-antigen positive sera, it detected, more frequently than ELISA, HIV-antigen in seminal and oral fluids. The PA-CBT/G method could thus be useful to fully characterise individual HIV excretion patterns in body fluids other than sera even from patients negative for HIV-antigen by ELISA. ;polyalanine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

Glycoprotein gC-rich antigen was prepared by heparin affinity chromatography from PRV-infected cell lysates. The preparations were mixed with mineral oil adjuvant as a water-in-oil emulsion. Six-week-old pigs were immunized twice at two-week intervals with trial vaccines containing 128,000, 12,800 and 1,280 HA units per dose of gC antigen. They were then challenged with a virulent PRV at day 7 after the final immunization. Neutralizing (NT) antibodies were produced with increase of antibody titers after challenge. Pigs immunized with 128,000 HA units per dose of gC survived and showed no virus shedding during the 2-week experimental period after the challenge. The role of cell-mediated immunity was examined using BALB/c mice, and induction of gC-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) was detected by 51Cr release assay. From these results with mice, it is inferred that cell-mediated immunity, especially CTL, may play an important role in the effectiveness of our trial vaccine in addition to humoral immunity.;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

713;9712750;The dominant epitope of Borrelia garinii outer surface protein C recognized by sera from patients with neuroborreliosis has a surface-exposed conserved structural motif.;Epitope mapping of outer surface protein C (OspC) by using sera from patients with neuroborreliosis led to the identification of one single major immunodominant epitope within the C-terminal 10 amino acid residues. Peptide binding studies and alanine replacement scanning of the C-terminal decapeptide, PVVAESPKKP, revealed a critical role for the PKKP sequence and its terminal carboxyl group for the binding of immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies from patients with Lyme borreliosis. Electron microscopy of antibody-labeled spirochetes indicated that the C-terminal region is exposed on the surface of the spirochete. Based on homology to proteins of known function, this region most probably adopts a polyproline II-like helix, which is found in surface-exposed structures involved in protein-protein interactions. This structural motif is highly conserved in Borrelia species causing Lyme borreliosis and subjected to purifying selection. We suggest that the abundance of the C-terminal region of OspC on the surface of B. burgdorferi allows a multimeric high-avidity interaction between the spirochete and surface Igs on B cells. The resulting cross-linking of surface Igs on B cells may induce a T-cell-independent B-cell activation without IgM-to-IgG switching, thus explaining the lack of IgG antibodies to OspC in neuroborreliosis.;polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function
715;7102257;Polymyositis--treatment and prognosis. A study of 107 patients.;One hundred and seven patients with polymyositis or dermatomyositis were followed for an average of 5 years. In 100 patients it was possible to evaluate the effect of treatment with steroids or a combination of steroids and immunosuppressive drugs. Fifty patients improved, 50 did not. Compared with the treatment-resistant group the treatment-responsive patients were of younger age, did not have an associated malignancy or cardiac disease and began treatment within 24 months after the onset of muscular weakness. In the treatment-responsive group the degree of improvement was correlated to the mean dose of steroids given during the first 3 months of treatment. Eighty-seven per cent of surviving responsive patients had no or slight disability at the end of the investigation. The mortality rate was 23% and was highest in the treatment-resistant group. Comparison between different treatment programs was possible and based on the results, a treatment schedule could be recommended. The principles of this schedule are: During the first month high doses of prednisone or prednisolone should be given daily. From the second month, an alternate-day administration can be employed. Tapering to maintenance dose should be gradual and slow. The treatment period should be long. The mean duration in the present series was 27 months.;-;-;-;hard_0

MCF-7 cells responded chemotactically to all chemokines tested in a pattern which was dose and time dependent, although responses to the different chemokines were variable. ZR-75-1 responded to MIP-1beta and GRO-alpha, giving maximum migration indices of 3.7 and 5.3, respectively, and exhibited a migratory response to MIP-1alpha, IL-8 and MCP-1 although to a lower degree. T47D was unresponsive to the chemokines tested, but both MCF-7 and T47D cells bound radiolabelled ligands with binding constants (Kd) ranging from 0.6 to 2.2 nM and 0.6 to 2.1 nM, respectively. The specificity of the chemotactic response of MCF-7 to MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta was confirmed using chemokine-specific neutralising antibodies and heat denaturation, and was demonstrated to involve G protein and cyclic AMP signalling pathways. MIP-1beta and MIP-1alpha were shown to induce changes in the organisation of the actin cytoskeleton and the level of F-actin in MCF-7 cells, as determined using flow cytometric analysis and confocal microscopy. Our results show that breast carcinoma cells can respond to chemokines, and suggests a potential role for these molecules in the process of tumour cell migration, invasion and metastasis.;-;-;-;hard_0
720;9013622;Expression of the 90K immunostimulator gene is controlled by a promoter with unique features.;"90K is a secreted glycoprotein with tumor suppressive functions, which is up-regulated in various types of cancer and in AIDS. In order to understand the regulation of its expression, the mouse 90K gene was isolated and analyzed. The gene spans about 8.8-kilobase pairs and consists of 6 exons and was localized on chromosome 11, region E. RNase protection identified one major transcription start site (+1) and three minor ones (-3, +32, +34). The mouse 90K gene was found to have a TATA-less promoter of unusual structure. The 2. 3-kilobase pair 5'-flanking region exhibited strong promoter activity in NIH 3T3 cells; however, it contained neither a TATA-box nor a SP1 site and was not GC-rich. No known initiator motif was found around the transcription start site. 5'- and 3'-deletions defined a minimal promoter of 51 base pairs (-66 --> -16), not including the start site, essential and sufficient for promoter activity. This minimal promoter showed increased activity after stimulation with interferon-gamma or poly(I.C), a substance mimicking viral infection. Essential for both inductions was the integrity of an interferon regulatory factor element within this sequence, a potential binding site for the anti-oncogenic transcription factor interferon regulatory factor-1.";polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
721;22337810;MNK2 inhibits eIF4G activation through a pathway involving serine-arginine-rich protein kinase in skeletal muscle.;Skeletal muscle mass is regulated by activity, metabolism, and the availability of nutrients. During muscle atrophy, MNK2 expression increases. We found that MNK2 (mitogen-activated protein kinase-interacting kinase 2), but not MNK1, inhibited proteins involved in promoting protein synthesis, including eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Phosphorylation at serine 1108 (Ser¹¹⁰⁸) of eIF4G, which is associated with enhanced protein translation, is promoted by insulin-like growth factor 1 and inhibited by rapamycin or starvation, suggesting that phosphorylation of this residue is regulated by mTOR. In cultured myotubes, small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of MNK2 increased eIF4G Ser¹¹⁰⁸ phosphorylation and overcame rapamycin's inhibitory effect on this phosphorylation event. Phosphorylation of Ser¹¹⁰⁸ in eIF4G, in gastrocnemius muscle, was increased in mice lacking MNK2, but not those lacking MNK1, and this increased phosphorylation was maintained in MNK2-null animals under atrophy conditions and upon starvation. Conversely, overexpression of MNK2 decreased eIF4G Ser¹¹⁰⁸ phosphorylation. An siRNA screen revealed that serine-arginine-rich protein kinases linked increased MNK2 activity to decreased eIF4G phosphorylation. In addition, we found that MNK2 interacted with mTOR and inhibited phosphorylation of the mTOR target, the ribosomal kinase p70S6K (70-kD ribosomal protein S6 kinase), through a mechanism independent of the kinase activity of MNK2. These data indicate that MNK2 plays a unique role, not shared by its closest paralog MNK1, in limiting protein translation through its negative effect on eIF4G Ser¹¹⁰⁸ phosphorylation and p70S6K activation. ;polyarginine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
723;8950616;Biochemical diagnostic strategies in the evaluation of short stature: the diagnosis of insulin-like growth factor deficiency.;The cornerstones in the evaluation of short stature are auxology and biochemical testing. Traditionally, the diagnosis of growth hormone (GH) deficiency has been based upon measurement of serum concentrations of GH following either physiological or pharmacological stimulation, or determination of spontaneous GH secretory patterns. Assessment of pituitary GH secretion is, however, fraught with problems, including the nonphysiological nature of provocative testing, the reliance on arbitrary definitions of subnormal responses, the inadequate attention paid to age- and puberty-related variability, and the dependence upon assays with marginal concordancy. It is proposed that the evaluation of short stature is best pursued by careful auxology plus assessment of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis, with particular attention to measurements of serum concentrations of IGF-I and IGF-binding protein-3. The diagnosis of IGF deficiency can then be readily established, and its etiology pursued logically.;-;-;-;hard_0

Concomitant primary wound closure was then accomplished through mobilization of laterally based skin flaps. Without exception, the resultant coelom was adequately spacious, as reflected postoperatively by both ventilation and venous return being unimpaired. Four babies died, three as a result of antecedent cerebral hypoxia complicating diaphragmatic herniation and one as a result of sepsis. Indications for the procedure were a massive omphalocele in 31 infants, gastroschisis in nine and a huge diaphragmatic hernia in four. Wound dehiscence with exposure of the fascial prosthesis occurred twice, once because of a cautery burn of the skin and after minor wound infection in the second. Revision of the initial abdominal wall repair was required in both of these babies as well as for incomplete extrusion of Marlex mesh in three older children. Prolene is now preferred for fascial prostheses. Prime advantages of the technique include immediate enlargement of the peritoneal capacity, rare necessary for ventilatory support, maintenance of abdominal support by a fascial gusset, elimination of infectious complications attending more delayed closures of wound and peritoneum and the uncommon need for later operative revision.;-;-;-;hard_0

732;6384158;Differential radioprotection of normal tissues by hydrophilic chemical protectors.;Analogous to certain radiosensitizers which are too hydrophilic to enter tumor cells, certain radioprotectors, because of their hydrophilicity, may also be hindered from entering tumor cells and thus protect only normal tissues. In testing this hypothesis, we utilized thin layer chromatography as convenient means to measure radioprotector hydrophilicity. Dose reduction factors (DRF's) for hematopoietic radioprotection were determined in BALB/c mice given half maximum tolerated doses (MTD/2) of 11 radioprotectors 30 min prior to graded doses of gamma rays. DRF's for tumor protection were determined in MCa-11 tumor-bearing mice using a regrowth delay assay.

Guilt and self-image disparity were assessed in 47 young adults in Study 1, and in 108 children, of varying intellectual abilities, in the 5th, 8th, and 11th grades in Study 2. In both studies, guilt was related to self-image disparity. At all age levels, guilt was related to a higher ideal self-image.

By comparing substituted A24 peptides as competitors in a functional competition assay, the A24 residues Tyr-171, Thr-178, and Leu-179 were identified as possible contact residues for Kd. A highly active competitor peptide analog was synthesized in which Tyr was separated from the Thr-Leu pair by a pentaproline spacer. The choice of proline allowed the prediction of a probable conformation for the analog when bound to the Kd molecule.

740;8155607;Effect of polyurethane surface chemistry on its lipid sorption behavior.;The relationships among surface, bulk properties and lipid sorption behaviors of segmented polyurethanes (SPUs) with various polyol soft segments were investigated. The polyols used in this study were poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), poly(tetramethylene oxide) (PTMO), and poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). The hard segment of these segmented polyurethanes was composed of 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate and 1,4-butanediol, present at 50 wt%. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) and dynamic contact angle measurements were carried out in order to analyze the surface chemical structure in the air- and water-equilibrated states. XPS revealed that in the air-equilibrated state, lower surface free energy components were enriched at the air-solid interface, whereas in the water-equilibrated state, higher surface free energy components were enriched at the water-solid interface. The change in environment from air to water induced the surface reorganization in order to minimize interfacial free energy. Lipid sorption behaviors of SPUs were investigated by means of infrared spectroscopy. Even after extensive rinsing of the surface, the amount of lipid present on the SPU surface was more than that calculated on the assumption that a monolayer covers the SPU surface. Therefore, the lipid was not only adsorbed on the surface of SPU but absorbed into SPU. The SPU with hydrophilic PEO sorbed larger amount of phospholipid compared with that with hydrophobic polyol such as PTMO and PDMS. Also, the competitive sorption behaviors of phospholipid and cholesterol from their mixed liposome solution were studied.

This review highlights the most relevant biological properties of these peptides, focusing on the potential therapeutic role that the PRPs may play as a promising source of new peptide-based novel drugs. ;polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function
743;8417340;Developmental regulation and tissue distribution of the liver transcription factor LFB1 (HNF1) in Xenopus laevis.;The transcription factor LFB1 (HNF1) was initially identified as a regulator of liver-specific gene expression in mammals. It interacts with the promoter element HP1, which is functionally conserved between mammals and amphibians, suggesting that a homologous factor, XLFB1, also exists in Xenopus laevis. To study the role of LFB1 in early development, we isolated two groups of cDNAs coding for this factor from a Xenopus liver cDNA library by using a rat LFB1 cDNA probe. A comparison of the primary structures of the Xenopus and mammalian proteins shows that the myosin-like dimerization helix, the POU-A-related domain, the homeo-domain-related region, and the serine/threonine-rich activation domain are conserved between X. laevis and mammals, suggesting that all these features typical for LFB1 are essential for function. Using monoclonal antibodies, we demonstrate that XLFB1 is present not only in the liver but also in the stomach, intestine, colon, and kidney. In an analysis of the expression of XLFB1 in the developing Xenopus embryo, XLFB1 transcripts appear at the gastrula stage. The XLFB1 protein can be identified in regions of the embryo in which the liver diverticulum, stomach, gut, and pronephros are localized. The early appearance of XLFB1 expression during embryogenesis suggests that the tissue-specific transcription factor XLFB1 is involved in the determination and/or differentiation of specific cell types during organogenesis. ;polythreonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
744;8148872;Ten nucleotide differences, five of which cause amino acid changes, are associated with the Ah receptor locus polymorphism of C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mice.;"We have analysed by heteroduplex formation (HF), single stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and nucleotide sequencing the cDNAs of the Ahrb-1 and Ahrd allelic forms of the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) present in inbred strains of mice. The Ahrb-1 allele, found in the C57BL and C57BR strains, encodes a 95 kDa receptor with an affinity for ligand 15-20 times higher than the affinity of the 104 kDa receptor encoded by the Ahrd allele, found in the DBA/2 strain. Five overlapping fragments of the AhR coding sequence were obtained from liver RNA by reverse transcriptase synthesis of a cDNA first strand, followed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of these cDNA sequences (RT-PCR). Analysis by HF and SSCP revealed the presence of sequence differences in three of the five fragments. When the complete nucleotide sequence of the coding regions was determined by PCR sequencing, we found a total of ten nucleotide differences between the two alleles, nine of which localized to the three fragments where differences were detected by HF and SSCP. Five of the differences are silent. Of the other five, one changes the opal termination codon in Ahrb-1 to the codon for Arg in Ahrd, extending translation of the mRNA by 43 amino acids and accounting for the larger size of the AhR peptide in DBA/2 mice. One of the four remaining differences causes the replacement of a leucine residue in Ahrb-1 by a proline residue in Ahrd, and breaks a potential alpha-helix near the AhR Q-rich region; it is likely that structural changes associated with this amino acid change are responsible for the differences in agonist affinity observed between the Ah receptors of these two strains of mice.";polyglutamine;helix;-;LCR_with_function

752;1340212;The insulin receptor and type I IGF receptor: comparison of structure and function.;The insulin receptor and type I IGF receptor are closely related in structure and function. The receptors are heterotetrameric glycoproteins, of structure alpha beta beta alpha, which are widely distributed in mammalian tissues. A third member of this receptor family has been described, the insulin receptor-related receptor for which a ligand has still to be identified. It has also been demonstrated that the insulin receptor and IGF receptor form alpha beta beta alpha hybrids in cells expressing both receptors. The key elements in the function of any receptor are recognition of ligand and transmission of an intracellular signal. In the insulin and IGF receptors, determinants of binding specificity are contained within amino-terminal and cysteine-rich domains of the extracellular alpha-subunit. Intracellular signalling is dependent on ligand activated tyrosine kinase activity in the transmembrane beta-subunit, which phosphorylates both the receptor itself and the specific substrate insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). Phosphorylated IRS-1 binds the enzyme phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and may act as a multivalent docking site for SH2 domains of other proteins involved in signalling. The possibility that some signalling molecules interact directly with the receptors has not been ruled out. The specificity of action of insulin and IGFs in vivo depends on differences between the respective receptors in tissue distribution, ligand binding specificity and intrinsic signalling capacity. However, the detailed aspects of gene and receptor structure which underly these functional differences are still poorly understood. Moreover, the issue of specificity is complicated by the existence of hybrid and atypical receptors, which in principle could bind and respond to both insulin and IGF-I, although the physiological significance of these receptor subtypes is at present unclear.;polycysteine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
756;6374467;Successive incorporation of force-generating units in the bacterial rotary motor.;"Mot mutants of Escherichia coli are paralysed: their flagella appear to be intact but do not rotate. The motA and motB gene products are found in the cytoplasmic membrane; they do not co-purify with flagellar basal bodies isolated in neutral detergents. Silverman et al. found that mot mutants could be ' resurrected ' through protein synthesis directed by lambda transducing phages carrying the wild-type genes. Here, we have studied this activation at the level of a single flagellar motor. Cells of a motB strain carrying plasmids in which transcription of the wild-type motB gene was controlled by the lac promoter were tethered to a glass surface by a single flagellum. These cells began to spin within several minutes after the addition of a lac inducer, and their rotational speed changed in a series of equally spaced steps. As many as 7 steps were seen in individual cells and, from the final speeds attained, as many as 16 steps could be inferred. These experiments show that each flagellar motor contains several independent force-generating units comprised, at least in part, of motB protein.";-;-;-;hard_0
757;28710009;mRNA interactome capture in mammalian cells.;Throughout their entire life cycle, mRNAs are associated with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), forming ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes with highly dynamic compositions. Their interplay is one key to control gene regulatory mechanisms from mRNA synthesis to decay. To assay the global scope of RNA-protein interactions, we and others have published a method combining crosslinking with highly stringent oligo(dT) affinity purification to enrich proteins associated with polyadenylated RNA (poly(A)+ RNA). Identification of the poly(A)+ RNA-bound proteome (also: mRNA interactome capture) has by now been applied to a diversity of cell lines and model organisms, uncovering comprehensive repertoires of RBPs and hundreds of novel RBP candidates. In addition to determining the RBP catalog in a given biological system, mRNA interactome capture allows the examination of changes in protein-mRNA interactions in response to internal and external stimuli, altered cellular programs and disease. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

761;6200189;Differential ontogenesis of D1 and D2 dopaminergic receptors in the chick embryo retina.;The differentiation of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors was investigated during the ontogenesis of the chick embryo retina. Our results reveal an interesting complexity in dopaminergic differentiation, with one major receptor system developing before synapses and another one developing after. The dopamine-dependent increase of chick retina cAMP level differentiates early during retina ontogeny. By the embryonic day 10-11 10(-4) M dopamine and ADTN elicit a 13-fold increase in cAMP content of the retina. However, [3H]spiperone (D2 ligand) binds very little to crude membrane preparation of retinas from embryos in the same developmental stage (12-13 fmol/mg protein). High specific binding of [3H]spiperone is only detected after the embryonic day 17-18, attaining 80 to 100 fmol of specific spiperone binding sites in the retinas from post-hatched animals. Apomorphine also promotes the accumulation of cAMP of retinas from early embryonic stages. However, it is only 20-30% as effective as ADTN or dopamine. In addition, while the dopamine responsiveness of the tissue decreases sharply during its ontogeny, the apomorphine effect remains practically constant throughout this period. Both dopamine and apomorphine are equally effective in eliciting cAMP accumulation of retinas from post-hatched animals. Moreover, apomorphine is a potent inhibitor of dopamine-induced cAMP level of the embryonic tissue. The results presented here indicate that D1 and D2 receptors differentiate independently from each other, and that apomorphine elevates retina cAMP levels via a subclass of D1 receptors that does not desensitize significantly during retina development.;-;-;-;hard_0
764;1661148;Aggregation of IGF-I receptors or insulin receptors and activation of their kinase activity are simultaneously caused by the presence of polycations or K-ras basic peptides.;Several groups including us reported that basic proteins and polycations activate the insulin receptor tyrosine-specific protein kinase (TPK) in vitro. However, some inconsistency has become obvious in the observations. The most intriguing was the brief description by Morrison et al. [(1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 9994-10001] that polylysine had no effect on the IGF-I receptor TPK despite its 84% identity to the insulin receptor TPK. In the present study, we used highly purified IGF-I and insulin receptor TPKs in an effort to solve the discrepancies noted in the recent publications and to reveal the mechanism by which polycations stimulate the receptor TPKs. We report that the IGF-I receptor TPK is stimulated by polycations and basic proteins in a manner similar to their effects on the insulin receptor TPK. When effects of polylysine and polyarginine on both receptor TPKs were closely compared, subtle qualitative differences were found: Polylysine stimulated autophosphorylation and exogenous substrate phosphorylation activities of both insulin receptor TPK and IGF-I receptor TPK similarly. In contrast, another polycation, polyarginine, affected both TPKs in a manner quite different from polylysine: Polyarginine stimulated insulin receptor autophosphorylation to a greater extent than polylysine did while it had a very small effect on the IGF-I receptor autophosphorylation as well as the exogenous substrate phosphorylation activities of the two receptor TPKs. We have further extended the studies to include the domains of natural proteins which contain a polylysine-like sequence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS);polyarginine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
765;7058207;Phencyclidine in combination with pentobarbital: supra-additive effects on complex operant behavior in patas monkeys.;In one component of a multiple schedule, patas monkeys acquired a different four-response chain each session by responding sequentially on three keys in the presence of four geometric forms (learning). In the other component, the four-response chain was the same each session (performance). The response chain in each component was maintained by food presentation under a fixed-ratio schedule. Errors produced a brief timeout but did not reset the chain. When administered alone, phencyclidine and pentobarbital, at the higher doses, generally decreased the overall response rate and increased the percent errors in both components. The performance component tended to be less sensitive than the learning component to the drug effects. When phencyclidine was administered in combination with pentobarbital, the phencyclidine dose-effect curves for both rate and accuracy generally shifted progressively to the left as the dose of pentobarbital was increased. In two of three monkeys, combinations of phencyclidine with a high dose of pentobarbital consistently produced greater rate-decreasing and error-increasing effects than expected from simple addition of the effects of each drug given alone. In other words, the phencyclidine-pentobarbital combinations produced supra-additive effects on responding under the multiple schedule.;-;-;-;hard_0
766;6412140;Lymphoid blast crises of chronic myelogenous leukemia represent stages in the development of B-cell precursors.;The origin and stage of differentiation of the blast-crisis cells in chronic myelogenous leukemia have remained uncertain. Because immunoglobulin heavy-chain and light-chain genes must undergo a DNA rearrangement during B-cell development but rarely do so in human non-B-cell lineages, we examined these genes in 18 episodes of chronic myelogenous leukemia. In eight of nine episodes of lymphoid blast crisis, heavy-chain genes were rearranged, and in three, rearrangements in light-chain genes were also present. In contrast, cells from chronic myeloid, myeloid blast, and erythroid-like phases retained germ-like immunoglobulin genes. The observed phenotypic markers and gene configurations revealed that most lymphoid blast crises represent stages of development of B-cell precursors. In two separate episodes of lymphoid crisis, cells from a single patient possessed identical heavy-chain but different light-chain-gene configurations. Thus, the precursor cells that monoclonally expand to produce a lymphoid crisis are capable of immunoglobulin-gene rearrangements and represent discrete steps in early B-cell maturation.;-;-;-;hard_0

776;1512255;Insect proteins homologous to mammalian high mobility group protein 1. Characterization and DNA-binding properties.;Two chromosomal high mobility group (HMG) proteins from larvae of Chironomus thummi (Diptera) and from an epithelial cell line of Chironomus tentans were purified to homogeneity and chemically characterized. cDNA clones encoding these proteins were isolated from an expression library using an immunoscreening approach and were sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequences revealed their homology to HMG protein 1 of vertebrates. These insect proteins have therefore been designated cHMG1a and cHMG1b. They have a molecular mass of 12,915 and 12,019 kDa, respectively, and preferentially bind to AT-rich DNA. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with a polyclonal antibody showed the presence of cHMG1a and cHMG1b in condensed chromomeres but not in puffs, nucleoli, and cytoplasm. The cHMG1a and cHMG1b genes were both localized to a single band in region 14 of chromosome 1 of C. tentans and appear to be single copy genes. An immunologically related protein was purified from Drosophila melanogaster Kc cells. Its size and amino acid composition indicate that it is an HMG1 of D. melanogaster. On the other hand, our antibody did not recognize calf HMG1.

777;16263722;WNK1 regulates phosphorylation of cation-chloride-coupled cotransporters via the STE20-related kinases, SPAK and OSR1.;The WNK1 and WNK4 genes have been found to be mutated in some patients with hyperkalemia and hypertension caused by pseudohypoaldosteronism type II. The clue to the pathophysiology of pseudohypoaldosteronism type II was its striking therapeutic response to thiazide diuretics, which are known to block the sodium chloride cotransporter (NCC). Although this suggests a role for WNK1 in hypertension, the precise molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we have shown that WNK1 phosphorylates and regulates the STE20-related kinases, Ste20-related proline-alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) and oxidative stress response 1 (OSR1). WNK1 was observed to phosphorylate the evolutionary conserved serine residue located outside the kinase domains of SPAK and OSR1, and mutation of the OSR1 serine residue caused enhanced OSR1 kinase activity. In addition, hypotonic stress was shown to activate SPAK and OSR1 and induce phosphorylation of the conserved OSR1 serine residue, suggesting that WNK1 may be an activator of the SPAK and OSR1 kinases. Moreover, SPAK and OSR1 were found to directly phosphorylate the N-terminal regulatory regions of cation-chloride-coupled cotransporters including NKCC1, NKCC2, and NCC. Phosphorylation of NCC was induced by hypotonic stress in cells. These results suggested that WNK1 and SPAK/OSR1 mediate the hypotonic stress signaling pathway to the transporters and may provide insights into the mechanisms by which WNK1 regulates ion balance. ;polyalanine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function

The encoded polypeptide (746 amino acids, Mr=81627) contains all conserved subdomains characteristic of the protein serine/threonine kinase family. A recombinant fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase catalysed autophosphorylation as well as phosphorylation of histone, confirming that SNRK has indeed protein kinase activity. By Northern blot hybridization, a 5-kb mRNA was detected in brain, heart, fat cells, intestine, testis, ovary, adrenal gland and thymus. In 3T3-L1 cells. SNRK was specifically expressed in the differentiated, adipocyte-like phenotype, whereas its mRNA was not detected in fibroblasts. Sequence comparisons of its catalytic domain relate SNRK to the SNF1 family of protein kinases. The noncatalytic domain comprises several intriguing structural features, including a glycine-rich region, two PEST sequences, and a bipartite nuclear localization signal which is preceded by a stretch of ten consecutive acidic residues. This part of the sequence exhibits no extended similarity with other proteins. In addition, we detected a high degree of sequence similarity with other SNF1-related proteinases in a small region (30-35 amino acids) flanking the C-terminus of the catalytic domain. This domain (designated the SNH domain) appears to define the subfamily of SNF1-related protein kinases and might represent a new type of regulatory domain of protein kinases.; polyglycine ;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
782;18418675;Molecular pathogenesis and cellular pathology of spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 neurodegeneration.;Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is unique among CAG/polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat diseases due to dramatic intergenerational instability in repeat length and an associated cone-rod dystrophy retinal degeneration phenotype. SCA7 is caused by a polyQ expansion in the protein ataxin-7. Like other neurodegenerative diseases caused by polyQ expansion mutations, the spectrum of clinical severity and disease progression worsens with increasing polyQ length. Several potential mechanisms for the molecular pathogenesis of polyQ-expanded ataxin-7 have been suggested. These include, but are not limited to, alteration of endogenous ataxin-7 function, abnormal processing and stability of polyQ ataxin-7, and alteration of transcriptional regulation via interaction of polyQ-expanded ataxin-7 with other transcriptional regulators. Ataxin-7's normal function as a transcription factor may contribute to the selective vulnerability of specific cellular populations in SCA7, and the resolution of the mechanistic basis of this pathogenic cascade is a major focus of SCA7 disease research. PolyQ-expanded ataxin-7 can cause non-cell autonomous neurodegeneration in cerebellar Purkinje cells. Advances in understanding SCA7's molecular basis have led to important insights into cell-type specific neurodegeneration. We expect that further study of ataxin-7 normal function, insights into the molecular basis of SCA7 neurodegeneration, and the development of therapeutic interventions for SCA7 will greatly influence related endeavors directed at other CAG/polyQ repeat diseases. ;polyglutamine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

Preferential binding to sequences with higher AT-content than the resident genome allows H-NS to repress the expression of foreign DNA in a process known as 'xenogeneic silencing.'

It binds specifically to the N terminus of tropomyosin and blocks the elongation and depolymerization of tropomyosin-coated actin filaments. A 1.9-kb human tropomodulin cDNA clone was used to map its gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The tropomodulin gene was assigned to human chromosome 9q22.2-q22.3, a region that is also known to contain several other genes and disease loci and is proximal to the loci for gelsolin and alpha-fodrin. The gene for tropomodulin is expressed in major human tissues at different levels in the following order: heart and skeletal muscle much greater than that in brain, lung, and pancreas, which is greater than that in placenta, liver, and kidney. Human tropomodulin and a 64-kDa autoantigen in Graves disease (1D) are related: tropomodulin has 42 and 41% identity with the Graves protein in the N-terminal (69 residue) and C-terminal (194 residue) regions, respectively. The insertion of several homologous repeats in the midsection of the Graves protein, together with the extension of a proline-rich C terminus, accounts for the differences in length between the Graves protein (572 residues) and tropomodulin (359 residues).

794;7891725;A direct interaction between a glutamine-rich activator and the N terminus of TFIIB can mediate transcriptional activation in vivo.;Studies examining the mechanism by which transcriptional activators function have suggested that the general transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) can be a target for certain regulatory proteins. For example, we showed previously that expression of a mutant form of TFIIB can specifically inhibit activation in vivo mediated by the strong, glutamine-rich activator protein GAL4-ftzQ. Using transient cotransfection assays, we have defined the regions in both GAL4-ftzQ and TFIIB that are required for activity in vivo and provide evidence that a potential zinc finger structure at the N terminus of TFIIB is necessary for the observed functional interaction between the two proteins. Using a protein binding assay, we have demonstrated that GAL4-ftzQ can specifically interact with TFIIB in vitro. This interaction requires the same regions in both molecules necessary for function in vivo and is reduced or eliminated by mutations predicted to disrupt the zinc finger in TFIIB. These results support the idea that a direct interaction between a regulatory protein and TFIIB can be important for transcriptional activation in vivo and, combined with previous data of others, suggest that different activators can function by contacting distinct regions of TFIIB.;polyglutamine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
795;9525923;Matrin CYP, an SR-rich cyclophilin that associates with the nuclear matrix and splicing factors.;We report the identification and cloning of a nuclear matrix protein termed matrin cyclophilin or matrin CYP. The derived sequence of matrin cyp encodes a protein of 752 amino acids with a predicted mass of 88 kDa. A 172-residue stretch at the amino terminus shows high identity with the ubiquitous family of cyclophilins. Clustered throughout the carboxyl half of the protein are a series of serine-arginine (SR) repeats that are a characteristic feature of many RNA splicing factors. Antibodies raised against matrin CYP recognize a 106-kDa antigen that is detected in isolated nuclei and quantitatively subfractionates in the nuclear matrix. Laser scanning confocal microscopy localizes most of the anti-matrin CYP-specific antigen within the nucleus in a pattern of large bright speckles that co-localize with splicing factors and diffuse nucleoplasmic staining. A strikingly similar pattern of staining is observed in cells extracted for in situ nuclear matrices. A fusion protein containing the cyclophilin domain of matrin CYP exhibits cyclosporin A (CsA)-sensitive, peptidylprolyl cis-trans-isomerase activity that is characteristic of native cyclophilins. Although total rat liver nuclei contains predominantly CsA-resistant PPIase activity, the corresponding activity in the nuclear matrix is largely CsA-sensitive. ;polyarginine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

803;23871830;Specificity protein 4 functionally regulates the transcription of NMDA receptor subunits GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B.;N-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are major glutamatergic receptors involved in most excitatory neurotransmission in the brain. The transcriptional regulation of NMDA receptors is not fully understood. Previously, we found that the GluN1 and GluN2B subunits of the NMDA receptor are regulated by nuclear respiratory factors 1 and 2 (NRF-1 and NRF-2). NRF-1 and NRF-2 also regulate all 13 subunits of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), a critical energy-generating enzyme, thereby coupling neuronal activity and energy metabolism at the transcriptional level. Specificity protein (Sp) is a family of transcription factors that bind to GC-rich regions, with Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 all binding to the same cis- motifs. Sp1 and Sp3 are ubiquitously expressed, whereas Sp4 expression is restricted to neurons and testicular cells. Recently, we found that the Sp1 factor regulates all subunits of COX. The goal of the present study was to test our hypothesis that the Sp factors also regulate specific subunits of NMDA receptors, and that they function with NRF-1 and NRF-2 via one of three mechanisms: complementary, concurrent and parallel, or a combination of complementary and concurrent/parallel. By means of multiple approaches we found that Sp4 functionally regulated GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B, but not GluN2C.

804;18056706;Regulation of FynT function by dual domain docking on PAG/Cbp.;"In resting T-cells, the transmembrane adaptor protein PAG (phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains) is constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated, a state maintained by the Src family kinase FynT. PAG has a role in negative regulation of Src family kinases in T-cells by recruitment of Csk (C-terminal Src kinase) to the membrane via binding to PAG phosphotyrosine 317. The interaction between FynT and PAG is essential for PAG function; however, so far the FynT binding mode has been unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the FynT-PAG complex formation is a dual domain docking process, involving SH2 domain binding to PAG phosphotyrosines as well as an SH3 domain interaction with the first proline-rich region of PAG. This binding mode affects FynT kinase activity, PAG phosphorylation, and recruitment of FynT and Csk, demonstrated in Jurkat TAg cells after antibody stimulation of the T cell receptor. Furthermore, we show that TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation is regulated by SH3 domain modulation of the FynT-PAG interaction in human primary T-cells. Although FynT SH3 domain association is shown to be crucial for efficiently initiating PAG phosphorylation, we suggest that engagement of the SH2 domain on PAG renders FynT insensitive to Csk negative regulation. Thus, in T-cells, PAG is involved in positive as well as negative regulation of FynT activity. ";polyproline;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function

It is usually suspected when an MM patient with elevated serum concentration of free LC presents kidney failure, but it often requires confirmation by kidney biopsy. We report the case of a 73-year-old woman who presented with fatigue, weight loss, and constipation. Laboratory exams revealed anemia, hypercalcemia, and kidney failure. Urine sediment analysis demonstrated irregular crystalline ""waxy type"" casts. With the hypothesis of LC cast nephropathy, immunostaining of the urine sediment was performed. The analysis revealed several rectangular and irregular casts with intense and bright stain for λ LCs only. A myelogram was performed, showing extensive occupation of the bone marrow by plasma cells; and immunofixation in urine and serum revealed monoclonal IgG-λ component, confirming the diagnosis of IgG-λ MM. This case highlights the potential utility of the urine sediment analysis and immuno-staining as a reliable non-invasive alternative method for diagnosis of cast nephropathy in patients with monoclonal gammopathies.";-;-;-;hard_0
807;9014794;Natural variability of transient myocardial ischaemia during daily life: an obstacle when assessing efficacy of anti-ischaemic agents?;"OBJECTIVE
To assess the degree of variability of transient myocardial ischaemia during daily life in patients with coronary artery disease, which could confound the interpretation of trials of the therapeutic effects of anti-ischaemic agents.


DESIGN
Prospective method evaluation.


SETTING
Tertiary referral centre, outpatient clinic.


PATIENTS
Patients with stable angina, confirmed coronary artery disease, and a positive treadmill exercise test for ischaemia. Patients were not preselected on the basis of prior documented transient ischaemia during ambulatory ST segment monitoring.


INTERVENTIONS
A simulated drug-study with 4 monitoring phases in 16 subjects. To minimise variability in ischaemic activity, patients underwent weekly 48 hour ambulatory ST segment monitoring outside hospital off all prophylactic therapy on the same weekdays for 4 weeks.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE
Variability in the frequency and duration of transient myocardial ischaemia.


RESULTS
There was marked variability in both ischaemic activity and mean duration of ischaemia in patients with confirmed ischaemia, the greatest degree of variability being between patients and from day to day within weeks within patients, with a further contribution to variability being noted between fortnights within patients.


CONCLUSIONS
Despite assessment off all therapy and an adequate period of monitoring (48 hours) with small intervals between monitoring periods (5 days), marked variability in ischaemic activity was noted, and regression towards the mean was clearly shown. Ambulatory ST segment monitoring outside hospital is not a reliable method for assessing the therapeutic effects of anti-ischaemic agents.";-;-;-;hard_0

811;2021619;Electrophoretic and hydrodynamic properties of duplex ribonucleic acid molecules transcribed in vitro: evidence that A-tracts do not generate curvature in RNA.;We have developed a T7 RNA polymerase based transcription system for the production of fully complementary RNA molecules (i.e., molecules capable of forming blunt-ended duplex species) as the direct products of transcription, thus rendering unnecessary the enzymatic removal of single-stranded ends. A combined gel electrophoretic and hydrodynamic analysis of a 180 bp double-stranded (ds) RNA molecule containing four A5-tracts in approximate phase coherence with the helix repeat provides no indication that the helix axis is curved, in sharp contrast to DNA molecules containing phased A-tracts. The electrophoretic behavior of dsRNA molecules reveals that their mobilities in nondenaturing acrylamide gels are approximately 10-20% lower than the corresponding mobilities of duplex DNA, in accord with earlier observations in the literature. Furthermore, the relative mobilities are only slightly modulated by gel concentration, the concentration of monovalent salt, or the presence of spermidine and/or Mg2+. The reduced mobilities are not caused by increased contour length, since direct hydrodynamic measurements using transient electric birefringence indicate that the average helix rise, h, of the dsRNA molecules examined in the current study is 2.8 +/- 0.1 A/bp. The reduced electrophoretic mobilities, extrapolated to zero acrylamide concentration, are consistent with the lower residual charge predicted for dsRNA by counterion condensation theory. Finally, birefringence measurements indicate that dsRNA is only marginally stiffer than DNA, with a persistence length of ca. 500-700 A. ;polyalanine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
812;16167095;Comparison of behavioral sequence of copulation between chimpanzees and bonobos.;We compared sex differences in behaviors leading to copulation of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in the Kalinzu Forest, Uganda with those of bonobos (Pan paniscus) at Wamba, D.R. Congo, using the same definition. Female chimpanzees were more likely to initiate copulation than female bonobos. While most of copulations (96%) were initiated by males in bonobos, among chimpanzees only 63% of copulations were initiated by males. Female bonobos initiated an interaction leading to copulation when males approached them within a short distance. On the other hand, both male and female chimpanzees initiated behavior at a longer distance. Higher proceptivity and a higher copulation rate during the maximal swelling period of female chimpanzees might suggest that they gain greater benefits from a high frequency of copulations than do female bonobos.;-;-;-;hard_0
815;9060682;Nucleolar and nuclear localization properties of a herpesvirus bZIP oncoprotein, MEQ.;Marek's disease virus (MDV) is one of the most oncogenic herpesviruses and induces T lymphomas in chickens within weeks after infection. Only a limited number of viral transcripts are detected in MDV tumor samples and cell lines. One of the major transcripts encodes MEQ, a 339-amino-acid bZIP protein which is homologous to the Jun/Fos family of transcription factors. The C-terminal half of MEQ contains proline-rich repeats and, when fused to the DNA-binding domain of a yeast transcription factor, Gal4 (residues 1 to 147), exhibits transactivation function. MEQ can dimerize with itself and with c-Jun. The MEQ-c-Jun heterodimers bind to an AP-1-like enhancer within the MEQ promoter region with greater affinity than do homodimers of either protein, and they transactivate MEQ expression. Here we show that MEQ is expressed in the nucleus but, interestingly, with a predominant fraction in the nucleoli and coiled bodies. This makes MEQ the first bZIP protein to be identified in the nucleoli. MEQ contains two stretches of basic residues, designated basic region 1 (BR1) and basic region 2 (BR2). Using a series of deletion mutants, we have mapped the primary nuclear localization signal (NLS) and the sole nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) to the BR2 region. BR1 was shown to provide an auxiliary signal in nuclear translocation. To demonstrate that BR2 is an authentic NoLS, BR2 was fused to cytoplasmic v-Raf (delta gag) kinase. The BR2-Raf fusion protein was observed to migrate into the nucleoplasm and the nucleolus. The BR2 region can be further divided into two long arginine-lysine stretches, BR2N and BR2C, which are separated by the five amino acids Asn-Arg-Asp-Ala-Ala (NRDAA). We provide evidence that the requirement for nuclear translocation is less stringent than that for nucleolar translocation, as either BR2N or BR2C alone is sufficient to translocate the cytoplasmic v-Raf (delta gag) into the nucleus, but only in combination can they translocate v-Raf (delta gag) into the nucleolus. Our studies demonstrate that MEQ is both a nuclear and nucleolar protein, adding MEQ to the growing list of transactivators which localize to the nucleolus. ;polyproline;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Standard photolithography process has been adopted to achieve the patterning of organic P(VDF-TrFE) films and top-gate electrodes, which is compatible with conventional CMOS process technology. An effective way for modulating the threshold voltage in the channel of P(VDF-TrFE) top-gate transistors under polarization has been reported. The introduction of functional P(VDF-TrFE) gate dielectric also provides us an alternative method to suppress the initial hysteresis of SWCNT networks and obtain a controllable ferroelectric hysteresis behavior.

In this strategy, a ""resistant"" gene would be introduced into target cells, rendering them resistance to the infection of HIV. The HIV-1 Tat protein transactivate HIV-1 gene expression at the transcriptional level by interacting with its response element (TAR) in the long terminal repeat (LTR). Previously, we have shown that antisense polyTAR-Core RNAs can inhibit the transactivation of HIV-1 Tat protein in transiently transfected Jurkat cells. To determine whether this antisense polyTAR-Core RNAs could inhibit HIV-1 replication in CD4+ T cells, we transfected the antisense polyTAR-Core gene to MT4 cells and challenged them with HIV-1 SF33 strain. Levels of HIV-1 p24gag antigen were reduced more than 4-fold in cultures of the transduced MT4/LR cells infected with HIV-1 SF33 strain. In contrast, cultures of nontransduced MT4 cells and control LX vector transduced MT4/LX cells infected with the same viruses had high levels of HIV-1 p24gag. Our work showed that antisense polyTAR-Core RNAs were able to inhibit HIV-1 replication in CD4+ T cells, and could be used as resistance gene in further studying for gene therapy against HIV-1.

819;7590237;Abl-interactor-1, a novel SH3 protein binding to the carboxy-terminal portion of the Abl protein, suppresses v-abl transforming activity.;A novel cellular protein, Abl-interactor-1 (Abi-1), which specifically interacts with the carboxy-terminal region of Abl oncoproteins, has been identified in a mouse leukemia cell line. The protein exhibits sequence similarity to homeotic genes, contains several polyproline stretches, and includes a src homology 3 (SH3) domain at its very carboxyl terminus that is required for binding to Abl proteins. The abi-1 gene has been mapped to mouse chromosome 2 and is genetically closely linked to the c-abl locus. The gene is widely expressed in the mouse, with highest levels of mRNA found in the bone marrow, spleen, brain, and testes. The Abi-1 protein coimmunoprecipitates with v-Abl and serves as a substrate for kinase activity. When overexpressed in NIH-3T3 cells, abi-1 potently suppresses the transforming activity of Abelson leukemia virus expressing the full-length p160v-abl kinase but does not affect the transforming activity of viruses expressing a truncated p90v-abl or v-src kinases. We suggest that the Abi-1 protein may serve as a regulator of Abl function in transformation or in signal transduction. ;polyproline;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function

831;8437858;Structure, expression and chromosomal mapping of c-akt: relationship to v-akt and its implications.;Sequence analysis of a nearly full-length murine c-akt cDNA clone and comparison with v-akt revealed the following: (a) The entire coding region of c-akt is identical to that of v-akt with the exception of five G to A transitions that do not alter the reading frame. The 3' untranslated regions of v-akt and c-akt are also identical with the exception of three single-base differences. (b) The recombination event that gave rise to v-akt occurred between the virus at nucleotide 785 from the Gag ATG codon and the 5' untranslated region of c-akt to 60 bp 5' from the c-akt ATG codon. (c) Three nucleotides absent from both Gag and c-akt were inserted at the junction between the two genes. The outcome of these events was to place, in frame, a 63-bp fragment between Gag and Akt. The resulting v-akt oncogene is predicted to encode a tripartite Gag (p12, p15, delta p30)-X-c-akt protein product. The c-akt protein contains, starting from its amino terminus, a src homology 2-like (SH2-like) domain, a domain rich in glutamic acid residues, part of which is predicted to form an amphipathic helix, and a kinase domain encoding a serine-threonine kinase with high degree of homology to members of the protein kinase C (PKC) family. The mouse c-akt is 90% homologous to human AKT1/RAC at the nucleic acid level and 98% homologous at the amino acid level. c-akt in the mouse is composed of 13 exons. The first exon contains a 5' untranslated GC-rich region. Since the recombination that gave rise to v-akt occurred with the 5' untranslated region, we hypothesize that the transduction of c-akt was preceded by provirus insertion upstream from or within the 5' untranslated region and in the same transcriptional orientation as the gene. c-akt was mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to mouse chromosome 12 and rat chromosome 6 in close proximity to the Igh locus.;polycysteine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
837;7579569;Cyclosporine A increases serum cortisol levels in rabbits.;P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a membrane protein that was originally found to be involved in the efflux of cytotoxic drugs out of the tumor cells, is also present in a variety of normal human and animal tissues, such as the adrenal cortex. The function of P-gp in the adrenal cortex has not been defined yet. The aim of our study was to determine whether the blockade of P-gp by cyclosporine A (CsA) dissolved in Cremophor EL (Crem) inhibits cortisol secretion in rabbits. In 14 rabbits, the baseline and ACTH stimulated serum cortisol levels were measured before and after CsA treatment. Seven rabbits were treated with 2 x 30 mg/kg CsA and seven with 2 x 90 mg/kg CsA injected s.c. Serum cortisol levels were determined by radioimmunoassay adjusted for expected values. The whole blood CsA levels were determined by a commercially available fluorescence polarization immunoassay. Serum cortisol levels, both baseline and ACTH stimulated, significantly increased after both low and high dose CsA treatment. The increase was dose dependent. The mean baseline cortisol levels increased from 5.7 (SD = 6.3) to 15.0 nmol/l (SD = 7.2) in the low dose group and from 7.7 (SD = 4.9) to 44.9 nmol/l (SD = 13.8) in the high dose group.

840;10607259;The core promoter of hepatitis B virus.;The core promoter (CP) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) plays a central role in HBV replication and morphogenesis, directing the transcription of both species of 3.5 kb mRNA: pregenomic (pg) RNA and precore (pre-C) mRNA. The CP overlaps the 3' end of the X open-reading frame (ORF) and the 5' end of the pre-C/C ORF. The major functional elements of the CP are the upper regulatory region (URR) and the basic core promoter (BCP). The BCP is sufficient for accurate initiation of both pre-C mRNA and pgRNA transcription. It contains four AT-rich regions and the initiators for pre-C mRNA and pgRNA transcription. The upstream regulatory region consists of the negative regulatory element and the core upstream regulatory sequence. Co-operative interaction of various liver-enriched and ubiquitous transcription factors is necessary for liver-specific expression from the CP. These factors bind to the CP. Sequence conservation within the CP is crucial for maintaining active viral replication, and variation may contribute to the persistence of HBV within the host, leading to chronic infection and, ultimately, hepatocarcinogenesis. The most frequently described mutations within this region are an A to T transversion at position 1762 together with a G to A transition at position 1764. This double mutant is accompanied by a reduced level of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) expression. Deletions, insertions and duplications occur within the CP. ;polythreonine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

The zinc finger in the MEN1 locus (ZFM1) gene, which has also been mapped to this region, represents a candidate gene for MEN1. The ZFM1 gene, which consists of 14 exons, encodes a 623-amino acid protein and exons 2, 8 and 12 encode the putative nuclear localisation signal, a zinc finger motif, and a proline-rich region, respectively. We have investigated these potentially functional regions for germ-line mutations by single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis in 64 unrelated MEN1 patients. In addition, we performed DNA sequence analysis of all the 14 exons and 13 of the 26 exon-intron boundaries in four unrelated MEN1 patients. A 6-bp deletion that resulted in the loss of two proline residues at codons 479 and 480 in exon 12 was found in one MEN1 patient. However, this did not co-segregate with MEN1 in the family and represented a rare polymorphism. Analysis by SSCP, DNA sequencing, northern blotting, Southern blotting and pulsed field gel electrophoresis revealed no additional genetic abnormalities of ZFM1 in the other MEN1 patients. Thus, our results indicate that ZFM1 is excluded as a candidate gene for MEN1. ;polyproline;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
843;21827767;Crystal structure of α-galactosidase from Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM: insight into tetramer formation and substrate binding.;Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM is a probiotic bacterium known for its beneficial effects on human health. The importance of α-galactosidases (α-Gals) for growth of probiotic organisms on oligosaccharides of the raffinose family present in many foods is increasingly recognized. Here, the crystal structure of α-Gal from L. acidophilus NCFM (LaMel36A) of glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 36 (GH36) is determined by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion. In addition, a 1.58-Å-resolution crystallographic complex with α-d-galactose at substrate binding subsite -1 was determined. LaMel36A has a large N-terminal twisted β-sandwich domain, connected by a long α-helix to the catalytic (β/α)(8)-barrel domain, and a C-terminal β-sheet domain. Four identical monomers form a tightly packed tetramer where three monomers contribute to the structural integrity of the active site in each monomer. Structural comparison of LaMel36A with the monomeric Thermotoga maritima α-Gal (TmGal36A) reveals that O2 of α-d-galactose in LaMel36A interacts with a backbone nitrogen in a glycine-rich loop of the catalytic domain, whereas the corresponding atom in TmGal36A is from a tryptophan side chain belonging to the N-terminal domain. Thus, two distinctly different structural motifs participate in substrate recognition. The tetrameric LaMel36A furthermore has a much deeper active site than the monomeric TmGal36A, which possibly modulates substrate specificity. Sequence analysis of GH36, inspired by the observed structural differences, results in four distinct subgroups having clearly different active-site sequence motifs. This novel subdivision incorporates functional and architectural features and may aid further biochemical and structural analyses within GH36. ;polyglycine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
845;18042812;Board-invited review: Recent advances in biohydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids within the rumen microbial ecosystem.;Recent advances in chromatographic identification of CLA isomers, combined with interest in their possible properties in promoting human health (e.g., cancer prevention, decreased atherosclerosis, improved immune response) and animal performance (e.g., body composition, regulation of milk fat synthesis, milk production), has renewed interest in biohydrogenation and its regulation in the rumen. Conventional pathways of biohydrogenation traditionally ignored minor fatty acid intermediates, which led to the persistence of oversimplified pathways over the decades. Recent work is now being directed toward accounting for all possible trans-18:1 and CLA products formed, including the discovery of novel bioactive intermediates. Modern microbial genetics and molecular phylogenetic techniques for identifying and classifying microorganisms by their small-subunit rRNA gene sequences have advanced knowledge of the role and contribution of specific microbial species in the process of biohydrogenation. With new insights into the pathways of biohydrogenation now available, several attempts have been made at modeling the pathway to predict ruminal flows of unsaturated fatty acids and biohydrogenation intermediates across a range of ruminal conditions.

Here we test a single family with 11 relevant meioses transmitting autosomal dominant acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplasia for linkage to three potential candidate loci. In a different family with inherited AML, linkage to chromosome 21q22.1-22.2 was recently reported; we exclude linkage to 21q22.1-22.2, demonstrating that familial AML is a heterogeneous disease. After reviewing familial leukemia and observing anticipation in the form of a declining age of onset with each generation, we had proposed 9p21-22 and 16q22 as additional candidate loci. Whereas linkage to 9p21-22 can be excluded, the finding of a maximum two-point LOD score of 2.82 with the microsatellite marker D16S522 at a recombination fraction theta = 0 provides evidence supporting linkage to 16q22. Haplotype analysis reveals a 23.5-cM (17.9-Mb) commonly inherited region among all affected family members extending from D16S451 to D16S289. In order to extract maximum linkage information with missing individuals, incomplete informativeness with individual markers in this interval, and possible deviance from strict autosomal dominant inheritance, we performed nonparametric linkage analysis (NPL) and found a maximum NPL statistic corresponding to a P-value of .00098, close to the maximum conditional probability of linkage expected for a pedigree with this structure. Mutational analysis in this region specifically excludes expansion of the AT-rich minisatellite repeat FRA16B fragile site and the CAG trinucleotide repeat in the E2F-4 transcription factor.

Examination of APCs from F1 mice (NOD x C57BL/6) indicated that the same APC expressed high levels of unstable I-Ag7 and normal amounts of stable class II molecules compared with the other haplotype (I-Ab).

Direct biochemical demonstration of peptide interactions with I-Ag7 was difficult to demonstrate. In T cell assays, the immunogenic peptides, including the diabetogenic Ag, were rapidly lost when peptide-pulsed APCs were washed free of peptide.

The assay is semiquantitative, and the results were expressed as a ratio between sample versus negative control (normal human serum). In 59 normal subjects, the mean ratio was 0.93 +/- (SD) 0.34. Thyroglobulin antibodies by radiometric assay, by hemagglutination (TgHA), as well as microsomal antibodies by hemagglutination (MCHA) were measured in 41 patients with a histopathologic diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (n = 22), adenomatous goiter (n = 10), carcinoma (n = 5), adenoma (n = 4), and in 59 patients without histopathologic diagnosis of thyroid disease. In patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, TgRA, TgHA, and MCHA were positive in 54, 31, and 81% of patients, respectively. 1 patient had positive TgRA with negative MCHA levels, and 2 had negative antibody titers by all methods. Thyrotropin-stimulating hormone levels were elevated (greater than 10 microU/ml) in 17 of these patients. Our results suggest that although the TgRA method is more sensitive than TgHA for detecting thyroglobulin antibodies, its diagnostic sensitivity is not equal to that of MCHA.;-;-;-;hard_0
869;9402896;Developmental changes in P1 and N1 central auditory responses elicited by consonant-vowel syllables.;"Normal maturation and functioning of the central auditory system affects the development of speech perception and oral language capabilities. This study examined maturation of central auditory pathways as reflected by age-related changes in the P1/N1 components of the auditory evoked potential (AEP). A synthesized consonant-vowel syllable (ba) was used to elicit cortical AEPs in 86 normal children ranging in age from 6 to 15 years and ten normal adults. Distinct age-related changes were observed in the morphology of the AEP waveform. The adult response consists of a prominent negativity (N1) at about 100 ms, preceded by a smaller P1 component at about 50 ms. In contrast, the child response is characterized by a large P1 response at about 100 ms. This wave decreases significantly in latency and amplitude up to about 20 years of age. In children, P1 is followed by a broad negativity at about 200 ms which we term N1b. Many subjects (especially older children) also show an earlier negativity (N1a). Both N1a and N1b latencies decrease significantly with age. Amplitudes of N1a and N1b do not show significant age-related changes. All children have the N1b; however, the frequency of occurrence of N1a increases with age. Data indicate that the child P1 develops systematically into the adult response; however, the relationship of N1a and N1b to the adult N1 is unclear. These results indicate that maturational changes in the central auditory system are complex and extend well into the second decade of life.";-;-;-;hard_0
870;9761052;Poststroke pain control by chronic motor cortex stimulation: neurological characteristics predicting a favorable response.;"OBJECT
The goal of this study was to identify the neurological characteristics of patients with poststroke pain who show a favorable response to motor cortex (MC) stimulation used to control their pain.


METHODS
The neurological characteristics of 31 patients treated by MC stimulation were analyzed. In 15 patients (48%), excellent or good pain control (pain reduction > 60%) was achieved for follow-up periods of more than 2 years by using MC stimulation at intensities below the threshold for muscle contraction. Satisfactory pain control was achieved in 13 (73%) of 18 patients in whom motor weakness in the painful area was virtually absent or mild, but in only two (15%) of the 13 patients who demonstrated moderate or severe weakness in the painful area (p < 0.01). Muscle contraction was inducible in the painful area in 20 patients when stimulated at a higher intensity. No such muscle response was inducible in the remaining 11 patients, no matter how extensively the authors attempted to determine appropriate stimulation sites. Satisfactory pain control was achieved in 14 (70%) of the 20 patients in whom muscle contraction was inducible, but in only one (9%) of the 11 patients in whom muscle contraction was not inducible (p < 0.01). No significant relationship was observed between pain control and various sensory symptoms, including the presence of hypesthesia, spontaneous dysesthesia, hyperpathia, and allodynia, or the disappearance of the N20 component of the median nerve-evoked somatosensory scalp potential. No significant relationship existed between the effect of MC stimulation on the pain and stimulation-induced phenomena, including paresthesia, improvement in motor performance, and attenuation of involuntary movements.


CONCLUSION
These findings suggest that the pain control afforded by MC stimulation requires neuronal circuits that are maintained by the presence of intact corticospinal tract neurons originating from the MC. Preoperative evaluation of motor weakness of the painful area appears to be useful for predicting a favorable response to MC stimulation in the control of poststroke pain.";-;-;-;hard_0
872;6965197;A microstructure model for the rheology of mammalian tendon.;The rheological behavior of mammalian tendon is analyzed in terms of its constituents structure and their properties. The elastic fibers are assumed to be straight and linearly elastic. They are of predominant role in the low ranges of strain. The collagen fibers are nonuniformly undulated. Upon stretch they gradually become straight, thus increasing the stiffness of the tissue. They are assumed to be linearly viscoelastic with negligible bending strength. It is shown that the nonuniformity of the collagen fiber structure can account for the observed nonlinear load-strain relations as well as for the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior of the tendon. An experimental procedure is developed through which the material functions and parameters can be determined.;-;-;-;hard_0
873;27577085;Mapping autoantigen epitopes: molecular insights into autoantibody-associated disorders of the nervous system.;Our knowledge of autoantibody-associated diseases of the central (CNS) and peripheral (PNS) nervous systems has expanded greatly over the recent years. A number of extracellular and intracellular autoantigens have been identified, and there is no doubt that this field will continue to expand as more autoantigens are discovered as a result of improved clinical awareness and methodological practice. In recent years, interest has shifted to uncover the target epitopes of these autoantibodies. The purpose of this review is to discuss the mapping of the epitope targets of autoantibodies in CNS and PNS antibody-mediated disorders, such as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR), leucine-rich glioma-inactivated protein 1 (Lgi1), contactin-associated protein-like 2 (Caspr2), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), aquaporin-4 (AQP4), 65 kDa glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), acetylcholine receptor (AChR), muscle-specific kinase (MuSK), voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC), neurofascin (NF), and contactin. We also address the methods used to analyze these epitopes, the relevance of their determination, and how this knowledge can inform studies on autoantibody pathogenicity. Furthermore, we discuss triggers of autoimmunity, such as molecular mimicry, ectopic antigen expression, epitope spreading, and potential mechanisms for the rising number of double autoantibody-positive patients. Molecular insights into specificity and role of autoantibodies will likely improve diagnosis and treatment of CNS and PNS neuroimmune diseases. ;polyleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
876;8132667;Expression of the dibasic proprotein processing enzyme furin is directed by multiple promoters.;"The prototype mammalian proprotein processing enzyme furin is shown to be encoded by three distinct FUR mRNA isoforms which differ only in their 5'-untranslated regions. By primer extension analysis, the transcription start sites of the three mRNA isoforms were defined. The genomic regions located immediately upstream of the three alternative transcriptional start sites were shown to possess promoter activity in transfection experiments using the luciferase encoding gene as reporter. In a liver cell line, the P1 promoter appeared to be the strongest; in a lung cell line, the P1A promoter. Human FUR promoter P1 but not P1A or P1B was transactivated by transcription factor C/EBP beta. Other members of this family of bZIP transcription factors, C/EBP alpha and C/EBP delta, were not able to transactivate the P1 promoter. Promoter P1A and P1B have characteristics of promoters of housekeeping genes. They lack TATA or CAAT boxes upstream of the transcription start site but are very GC-rich and contain several SP1 sites. Promoter P1, on the other hand, has a TATA box in the proximal promoter region. In electromobility shift assays and DNase I footprinting analysis, transcription factor SP1 was found to bind to the proximal region of the P1 promoter. Altogether, our results indicate that expression of the human FUR gene is directed by alternative promoters, housekeeping (GC-rich) as well as regulated (TATA-containing) promoters, suggesting that their differential use may be a mechanism to modulate levels of the furin enzyme.";polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
879;9038167;T-cell proto-oncogene rhombotin-2 is a complex transcription regulator containing multiple activation and repression domains.;The LIM domain protein rhombotin-2 (RBTN-2/TTG-2/LMO2) is involved in many processes, including leukemogenesis and erythropoiesis. It is thought that the principle role of RBTN-2 in these processes is to regulate transcription. To examine the potential for RBTN-2 to modulate transcription, we constructed RBTN-2/GAL4 DNA-binding domain fusion proteins and measured their ability to activate transcription of a reporter gene construct. From these studies we identified a transcription activation domain within the NH2 terminus of RBTN-2. This activation domain was further localized within a proline-rich 19-amino acid region. A second activation domain of 11 amino acids was also identified. This domain was located within the COOH terminus of RBTN-2, and functioned in mammalian cells but not in yeast. Furthermore, the two LIM domains of RBTN-2 were shown to function as transcription repression domains. Each individual LIM domain acted as an independent transcription repression domain on a heterologous activation domain. However, in context of full-length RBTN-2, the LIM domains selectively repressed the NH2-terminal activation domain, but had no effect on the COOH-terminal domain. Overall, these results demonstrate that the T-cell oncogene RBTN-2 is a complex transcription factor possessing multiple transcription regulatory modules, including two activation domains and two repression domains.;polyproline;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
884;31621902;Novel LRAP-binding partner revealing the plasminogen activation system as a regulator of cementoblast differentiation and mineral nodule formation in vitro.;Amelogenin isoforms, including full-length amelogenin (AMEL) and leucine-rich amelogenin peptide (LRAP), are major components of the enamel matrix, and are considered as signaling molecules in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions regulating tooth development and periodontal regeneration. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms involved are still poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to identify novel binding partners for amelogenin isoforms in the cementoblast (OCCM-30), using an affinity purification assay (GST pull-down) followed by mass spectrometry and immunoblotting. Protein-protein interaction analysis for AMEL and LRAP evidenced the plasminogen activation system (PAS) as a potential player regulating OCCM-30 response to amelogenin isoforms. For functional assays, PAS was either activated (plasmin) or inhibited (ε-aminocaproic acid [aminocaproic]) in OCCM-30 cells and the cell morphology, mineral nodule formation, and gene expression were assessed. PAS inhibition (EACA 100 mM) dramatically decreased mineral nodule formation and expression of OCCM-30 differentiation markers, including osteocalcin (Bglap), bone sialoprotein (Ibsp), osteopontin (Spp1), tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (Alpl) and collagen type I (Col1a1), and had no effect on runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and Osterix (Osx) mRNA levels. PAS activation (plasmin 5 µg/µl) significantly increased Col1a1 and decreased Bglap mRNA levels (p < .05). Together, our findings shed new light on the potential role of plasminogen signaling pathway in the control of the amelogenin isoform-mediated response in cementoblasts and provide new insights into the development of targeted therapies. ;polyleucine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
885;25060396;Contribution of transcription factor, SP1, to the promotion of HB-EGF expression in defense mechanism against the treatment of irinotecan in ovarian clear cell carcinoma.;Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is a worst histological subtype than other ovarian malignant tumor. Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is a promising target for ovarian cancer therapy. The aims of this study were to validate the efficacy of HB-EGF-targeted therapy for OCCC and to identify the transcription factor that contributed to the induction of HB-EGF by SN38 treatment in OCCC cells. HB-EGF was highly expressed in OCCC cells, and an increase of HB-EGF was induced by SN38 which had only antitumor effect among conventional anticancer agents on OCCC. A specific inhibitor of HB-EGF, a cross-reacting material 197 (CRM197), led to a synergistic increase in the number of apoptotic OCCC cells with the treatment of SN38. The luciferase assay with 5'-deletion promoter constructs identified a GC-rich element between -125 and -178 (the distal transcription start site was denoted +1) as a cis-regulatory region, and the treatment of SN38 induced luciferase activity in this region. An in silico and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis estimated that SP1 bound to the cis-regulatory region of HB-EGF in OCCC cells. Real-time PCR and cell viability assays showed that the transfection of a small interfering RNA targeting SP1 suppressed the expression of HB-EGF induced by SN38, resulting in the enhanced sensitivity of SN38. Taken together, these results indicate that induction of HB-EGF expression contributed to defense mechanism against treatment of SN38 through the transcriptional activity of SP1 in OCCC cells.  ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
888;10027587;Effect of masoprocol on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in a rat model of Type II diabetes.;Extracts of the creosote bush (Larrea tridentata, family Zygophyllaceae) have long been used as a folk remedy for Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes by native Americans in southwestern North America. In this study we have evaluated the metabolic effects of masoprocol, a pure compound isolated from the creosote bush, in a rat model of Type II diabetes. Animals were fed a 20% fat (by weight) diet for 2 weeks prior to intravenous injection with streptozotocin (STZ, 0.19 mmol/kg). Diabetic animals (glucose 16-33 mmol/l) were treated with vehicle, metformin (0.83 mmol/kg body weight) or masoprocol (0.83 mmol/kg body weight) twice a day for 4 days. Masoprocol treatment lowered glucose concentrations an average of 35% compared with vehicle (14.2+/-1.1 vs 21.7+/-1.0 mmol/l, p < 0.001), a reduction similar to metformin treatment (12.8+/-0.9 mmol/l), without any change in insulin concentration. Masoprocol treatment also lowered triglyceride concentrations 80% compared with vehicle (1.0+/-0.1 vs 4.8+/-0.3 mmol/l, p < 0.001), a reduction far greater than following metformin treatment (3.6+/-0.3 mmol/l). Non-esterified fatty acid and glycerol concentration were decreased by approximately 65% by masoprocol compared with vehicle, a reduction approximately twice as great as seen with metformin (p < 0.001). The effect of masoprocol on in vivo insulin-mediated glucose disposal was evaluated by infusing fat-fed/STZ rats with glucose (0.22 mmol kg x min(-1)) and insulin (30 pmol x kg x min(-1)) for 5 h. In response to the infusion, steady-state plasma glucose concentrations were reduced 30% in masoprocol-treated animals compared with vehicle controls (p < 0.05) with no change noted in rats treated with metformin. The effect of masoprocol treatment was also tested in primary adipocytes isolated from normal animals. Adipocytes treated with masoprocol (30 micromol/l) had higher basal and insulin-stimulated glucose clearance than did adipocytes treated with vehicle (p <0.05). These data show that masoprocol decreases both plasma glucose and triglyceride concentrations in fat-fed/STZ rats, presumably as a result of its ability to both increase glucose disposal and decrease lipolysis.;-;-;-;hard_0
893;8515463;A DNA dodecamer containing an adenine tract crystallizes in a unique lattice and exhibits a new bend.;The structure of d(CGCGAAAAAACG)/d(CGTTTTTTCGCG) was determined at 2.3 A resolution in order to deduce the local structural features that give rise to DNA bending by adenine tracts. Whereas all previously reported B-DNA dodecamers have crystallized isomorphously (spacegroup P2(1)2(1)2(1) with unit cell dimensions of a = 24.5 A, b = 40.3 A, c = 65.9 A), the duplex reported here crystallizes in a different lattice (spacegroup P2(1)2(1)2 with unit cell dimensions of a = 44.8 A, b = 66.1 A, c = 42.9 A). The DNA exhibits a 30 degree bend in the helix axis that is 180 degrees away from the 20 degree bend exhibited by the adenine tract DNA crystal structures that have been previously determined. This bend is 90 degrees away from the bend predicted for an adenine tract by solution and gel experiments. The adenine tract is straight and bending occurs in the G+C-rich regions. Comparison of the various adenine tract DNA crystal structures reveals that in all cases the adenine tracts have nearly identical structures, even though the overall bends of the helix axes are quite different. This implies that the structure of the adenine tract is robust, at least under the conditions of crystallization. The base-pairs in the adenine tracts exhibit a large propeller twist that leads to the formation of bifurcated hydrogen bonds and a narrow minor groove. In the crystal structure of d(CGCGAAAAAACG)/d(CGTTTTTTCGCG), a minor groove spine of hydration is observed that probably stabilizes the straight structure of the adenine tract. This straight structure of the A-tract is not consistent with the results of fiber diffraction, gel experiments, and NMR studies. Although this may imply that the results of solution experiments need to be reinterpreted, the conditions under which the crystals were grown are different from those under which the solution experiments were done. The possibility remains that the 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol necessary for crystal growth may facilitate formation of the spine of hydration that stabilizes the straight A-tract, although recent NMR results show the presence of the spine of hydration in aqueous solution. We have also extended our previously reported observation that non-self-complementary DNA structures can exist in the crystal lattice in two orientations. A dodecamer brominated on one strand provides experimental evidence that d(CGCAAAAAAGCG)/d(CGCTTTTTTG CG) is positioned in two orientations in the crystal lattice that are related by a 180 degree rotation around the pseudo-dyad axis of the sequence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) ;polycysteine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
898;8097732;A positive cis-regulatory element with a bicoid target site lies within the sea urchin Spec2a enhancer.;Activation of the aboral ectoderm-specific Spec2a gene in blastula-stage sea urchin embryos requires an upstream regulatory region that is part of a repetitive sequence element (RSR) associated with all Spec1/Spec2 genes. Deletions from the 5' end of Spec2a-flanking DNA, monitored for activity using the sea urchin embryo gene-transfer expression system, indicated that this regulatory region has multiple DNA elements and that no positive element lies upstream of the RSR. We mapped the regulatory region using Spec2a fragments containing RSR sequences fused to an SV40 minimal promoter. The region between base pairs -443 and -631, defined as the RSR enhancer, was essential for maximal activity and conferred preferential aboral ectoderm expression to a lacZ reporter gene. Expression was not fully restricted to aboral ectoderm, however, suggesting that negative spatial elements are also associated with the proper activation of Spec2a. DNaseI footprinting and band-shift analysis of the RSR enhancer identified an A/T-rich DNA element, the A/T palindrome. This element binds a single 45-kDa nuclear protein, the A/T palindrome binding protein (A/TBP), whose specificity suggests a possible relationship with the bicoid-class homeodomain proteins. Mutations of the A/T palindrome are incapable of binding the 45-kDa protein and lower promoter activity by eight-fold. DNA-binding activity for A/TBP is low in unfertilized eggs, increases by the 16-cell stage and continues rising in blastulae. These data suggest that A/TBP plays a major role in the activation of the Spec2a gene in aboral ectoderm cells.;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
899;10858228;Molecular cloning and expression of a gene encoding Cryptosporidium parvum glycoproteins gp40 and gp15.;Cryptosporidium parvum is a significant cause of diarrheal disease worldwide. The specific molecules that mediate C. parvum-host cell interactions and the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of cryptosporidiosis are unknown. In this study we have shown that gp40, a mucin-like glycoprotein, is localized to the surface and apical region of invasive stages of the parasite and is shed from its surface. gp40-specific antibodies neutralize infection in vitro, and native gp40 binds specifically to host cells, implicating this glycoprotein in C. parvum attachment to and invasion of host cells. We have cloned and sequenced a gene designated Cpgp40/15 that encodes gp40 as well as gp15, an antigenically distinct, surface glycoprotein also implicated in C. parvum-host cell interactions. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of the 981-bp Cpgp40/15 revealed the presence of an N-terminal signal peptide, a polyserine domain, multiple predicted O-glycosylation sites, a single potential N-glycosylation site, and a hydrophobic region at the C terminus, a finding consistent with what is required for the addition of a GPI anchor. There is a single copy of Cpgp40/15 in the C. parvum genome, and this gene does not contain introns. Our data indicate that the two Cpgp40/15-encoded proteins, gp40 and gp15, are products of proteolytic cleavage of a 49-kDa precursor protein which is expressed in intracellular stages of the parasite. The surface localization of gp40 and gp15 and their involvement in the host-parasite interaction suggest that either or both of these glycoproteins may serve as effective targets for specific preventive or therapeutic measures for cryptosporidiosis. ;polyserine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

906;11586359;A forkhead-domain gene is mutated in a severe speech and language disorder.;Individuals affected with developmental disorders of speech and language have substantial difficulty acquiring expressive and/or receptive language in the absence of any profound sensory or neurological impairment and despite adequate intelligence and opportunity. Although studies of twins consistently indicate that a significant genetic component is involved, most families segregating speech and language deficits show complex patterns of inheritance, and a gene that predisposes individuals to such disorders has not been identified. We have studied a unique three-generation pedigree, KE, in which a severe speech and language disorder is transmitted as an autosomal-dominant monogenic trait. Our previous work mapped the locus responsible, SPCH1, to a 5.6-cM interval of region 7q31 on chromosome 7 (ref. 5). We also identified an unrelated individual, CS, in whom speech and language impairment is associated with a chromosomal translocation involving the SPCH1 interval. Here we show that the gene FOXP2, which encodes a putative transcription factor containing a polyglutamine tract and a forkhead DNA-binding domain, is directly disrupted by the translocation breakpoint in CS. In addition, we identify a point mutation in affected members of the KE family that alters an invariant amino-acid residue in the forkhead domain. Our findings suggest that FOXP2 is involved in the developmental process that culminates in speech and language. ;polyglutamine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
910;9141699;Molecular characterization of the bet genes encoding glycine betaine synthesis in Sinorhizobium meliloti 102F34.;As a first step towards the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the utilization of choline and glycine betaine (betaine) either as carbon and nitrogen sources or as osmoprotectants in Sinorhizobium meliloti, we selected a Tn5 mutant, LTS23-1020, which failed to grow on choline but grew on betaine. The mutant was deficient in choline dehydrogenase (CDH) activity, failed to oxidize [methyl-14C]choline to [methyl-14C]betaine, and did not use choline, but still used betaine, as an osmoprotectant. The Tn5 mutation in LTS23-1020 was complemented by plasmid pCHO34, isolated from a genomic bank of S. meliloti 102F34. Subcloning and DNA sequencing showed that pCHO34 harbours two ORFs which showed 60% and 57% identity with the Escherichia coli betB gene encoding betaine-aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH) and betA gene encoding CDH, respectively. In addition to the homology with E. coli genes, the deduced sequence of the sinorhizobial BADH protein displays consensus sequences also found in plant BADHs. The deduced sequence of the sinorhizobial CDH protein shares only 21% identical residues with choline oxidase from Arthrobacter globiformis. The structural organization of the betBA genes in S. meliloti differs from that described in E. coli: (i) the two ORFs are separated by a 210 bp sequence containing inverted repeats resembling a putative rho-independent transcription terminator, and (ii) no sequence homologous to betT (high-affinity choline transport system) or betI (regulator) was found in the vicinity of the sinorhizobial betBA genes. Evidence is also presented that the S. meliloti betBA genes are not located on the megaplasmids.;-;-;-;hard_0
914;9684489;Effect of successful combined renal and pancreatic transplantation on diabetic retinopathy.;"UNLABELLED
The treatment of diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most challenging problems in ophthalmology. The possibility of modulating DR by successful combined kidney and pancreas transplantation thus holds an attractive promise for the ophthalmologist. From June 1983 until April 1997, a total of 86 combined kidney and pancreas transplantation procedures were performed at the Prague-based Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine. All recipients are on close follow-up in terms of their ophthalmic status. However, evaluation of the effect of transplantation is problematic because of the advanced status of DR prior to the procedure. We divided the transplant recipients into two groups according to type of transplantation. In Group I (segmental transplantation), proliferative DR was present in 100% eyes, 70% had undergone vitrectomy, and there were 21% of blind eyes. All eyes had been treated by laser. In this group, long-term stabilization of the finding was observed in three patients. In Group II (whole pancreas transplantation), proliferative and non-proliferative DR was diagnosed in 86% and 14%, respectively. There were 12% of blind eyes, and 70% had been treated by laser prior to transplantation. After a successful transplantation, stabilization was found in 60%, improvement in 18%, and deterioration in 22% of eyes in this group. The stabilization and improvement can be explained by subsequent normoglycemia (HbAlc 5.6%). By contrast, we were unable to provide a satisfactory explanation for the deterioration and progression of these findings. While the effect of immunosuppression on DR remains unclear, it obviously accelerates the existing cataract.


CONCLUSION
Successful combined transplantation has a beneficial effect on DR and is worthwhile even for patients at the end stage on account of its beneficial psychosocial effect and prevention of dolorous glaucoma. However, many effects of the procedure on the eye of diabetics remain to be identified in future studies.";-;-;-;hard_0
919;7495741;Evidence for a calcium regulated, bidirectional intronic promoter in the murine TCR V alpha 1 gene.;Previous studies of the TCR alpha chain gene have located promoter elements 5' to the start of the various V alpha genes. The only fully characterized enhancer for the entire alpha chain gene (V, J and C genes) has been located approximately 3 kb from the 3' end of C alpha. We now report the existence of additional regulatory elements located in the introns of several murine V alpha genes (V alpha 1, V alpha 3 and V alpha B6.2.16). In the case of V alpha 1, this element appears to be a promoter with bidirectional activity that is not T cell specific. Interestingly, upstream of the promoter in the antisense strand, an open reading frame has been found that codes for a small molecular weight protein (approximately 60 amino acids) that contains a proline-rich region and a tyrosine-isoleucine motif that has homology to Ig beta (the B29 gene product). A rabbit antiserum made against this sequence has confirmed its existence by Western blot and immunoprecipitation. Thus this V alpha 1 intronic promoter has the potential not only to induce the formation of a truncated V alpha 1 gene product, but also regulates the expression of a small molecular weight protein that may be involved in lymphocyte antigen receptor signaling. The activity of this promoter is regulated by changes in intracellular calcium. In the presence of ionomycin the promoter is down-regulated in the sense direction and its activity is enhanced in the antisense direction. This result suggests that this promoter can act differentially to produce two very different gene products. The bidirectional V alpha 1 promoter appears to be the first in the Ig superfamily to induce potentially functional proteins in both directions. ;polyproline;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

925;16571602;The nuclear microspherule protein 58 is a novel RNA-binding protein that interacts with fragile X mental retardation protein in polyribosomal mRNPs from neurons.;The fragile X syndrome, the leading cause of inherited mental retardation, is due to the inactivation of the fragile mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1) and the subsequent absence of its gene product FMRP. This RNA-binding protein is thought to control mRNA translation and its absence in fragile X cells leads to alteration in protein synthesis. In neurons, FMRP is thought to repress specific mRNAs during their transport as silent ribonucleoparticles (mRNPs) from the cell body to the distant synapses which are the sites of local synthesis of neuro-specific proteins. The mechanism by which FMRP sorts out its different mRNAs targets might be tuned by the intervention of different proteins. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, we identified MicroSpherule Protein 58 (MSP58) as a novel FMRP-cellular partner. In cell cultures, we found that MSP58 is predominantly present in the nucleus where it interacts with the nuclear isoform of FMRP. However, in neurons but not in glial cells, MSP58 is also present in the cytoplasmic compartment, as well as in neurites, where it co-localizes with FMRP. Biochemical evidence is given that MSP58 is associated with polyribosomal poly(A)+ mRNPs. We also show that MSP58, similar to FMRP, is present on polyribosomes prepared from synaptoneurosomes and that it behaves as an RNA-binding protein with a high affinity to the G-quartet structure. We propose that this novel cellular partner for FMRP escorts FMRP-containing mRNP from the nucleus and nucleolus to the somato-dendritic compartment where it might participate in neuronal translation regulation. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

932;8102627;Human colorectal carcinoma-specific glycoconjugates detected by pokeweed mitogen lectin.;Pokeweed mitogen (PWM) lectin, known to bind branched poly-N-acetyllactosamines, has a highly selective affinity for human colorectal carcinomas. We performed light microscopic (LM) histochemistry with PWM lectin on paraffin sections of human colorectal tissues. In histological sections, normal mucosae and adenomas with mild dysplasia exhibited negative reaction (0/10, 0/13, respectively) with or without neuraminidase pre-digestion, whereas adenomas with moderate dysplasia showed a small increase in PWM lectin reactivity after neuraminidase digestion (4/23). In contrast, we observed a high incidence of positive reactivity in colorectal carcinoma without neuraminidase pre-digestion (38/44). After digestion with neuraminidase, there was increased reactivity of colorectal carcinomas in situ (7/12) and invasive carcinomas (13/32). These results imply that human colorectal carcinomas consistently contain substantial amounts of PWM-reactive branched poly-N-acetyllactosamine glycoconjugates structures. We also compared the staining patterns of PWM lectin and monoclonal antibodies (MAb) directed to Lewis X (LeX) or Lewis Y (LeY) antigen. PWM lectin reactivity was largely confined to the apical membranes of carcinoma tissues. MAb-LeX or MAb-LeY immunoreactivity was seen on the apical membranes and in the cytoplasm of both adenomas and carcinomas. Therefore, histochemical studies with this lectin should be useful for identification of carcinoma tissues and analysis of glycoconjugates associated with colorectal carcinoma.;polyasparagine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
935;31811190;Improved Visualization of the Necrotic Zone after Microwave Ablation Using Computed Tomography Volume Perfusion in an In Vivo Porcine Model.;After hepatic microwave ablation, the differentiation between fully necrotic and persistent vital tissue through contrast enhanced CT remains a clinical challenge. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate new imaging modalities, such as CT perfusion (CTP) to improve the visualization of coagulation necrosis. MWA and CTP were prospectively performed in five healthy pigs. After the procedure, the pigs were euthanized, and the livers explanted. Orthogonal histological slices of the ablations were stained with a vital stain, digitalized and the necrotic core was segmented. CTP maps were calculated using a dual-input deconvolution algorithm. The segmented necrotic zones were overlaid on the DICOM images to calculate the accuracy of depiction by CECT/CTP compared to the histological reference standard. A receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to determine the agreement/true positive rate and disagreement/false discovery rate between CECT/CTP and histology. Standard CECT showed a true positive rate of 81% and a false discovery rate of 52% for display of the coagulation necrosis. Using CTP, delineation of the coagulation necrosis could be improved significantly through the display of hepatic blood volume and hepatic arterial blood flow (p < 0.001). The ratios of true positive rate/false discovery rate were 89%/25% and 90%/50% respectively. Other parameter maps showed an inferior performance compared to CECT.;-;-;-;hard_0
936;11465086;Molecular basis of the neutrophil glycoprotein NB1 (CD177) involved in the pathogenesis of immune neutropenias and transfusion reactions.;The human granulocyte alloantigen NB1, recently clustered as CD177, is heterogenously expressed on neutrophils of 88-97% of healthy individuals. Since its molecular nature has remained unknown, we isolated NB1 glycoprotein from granulocyte lysate by immunoaffinity chromatography. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry identified a 50,556 Da glycoprotein which was reduced to 43,069 Da after removal of N-linked carbohydrates. Following N-terminal amino acid sequencing and NB1-specific primer construction, rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR yielded a 1,614-bp cDNA for NB1. COS-7 cells transfected with the cDNA expressed immunoreactive NB1 glycoprotein. A 1,311-bp sequence was identified to be the entire coding region. The 5' and 3' untranslated regions consist of 27 bp and 276 bp, respectively. The open reading frame codes for 437 amino acids of which the first 21 form the signal peptide. The remaining 416 residues form a N-terminal extracellular protein with two cysteine-rich domains, three N-linked glycosylation sites and short transmembrane and cytoplasmic segments including a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol attachment (omega) site.

Purification involved sequential chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel, polylysine-agarose, heparin-agarose, Mono Q HR 10/10, and Superose 6. The enzyme was composed of three subunits with Mr = 63,000, 55,000, and 38,000, and it could dephosphorylate the sites on phospholamban phosphorylated by either cAMP-dependent or calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. Phospholamban phosphatase activity was enhanced 12-, 9-, and 3-fold by the divalent cations Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ca2+, respectively. The phosphatase was inhibited by PPi, ATP, NaF, and Pi and the degree of inhibition was different with each compound. The substrate specificity of the purified phosphatase for cardiac phosphoproteins was determined using troponin I, phospholamban, and highly enriched sarcolemmal and sarcoplasmic reticulum preparations, phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The phosphatase exhibited the highest activity with phospholamban as substrate. Thus, dephosphorylation of phospholamban by this phosphatase may participate in regulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum function in cardiac muscle.;polylysine;phosphatase activity;-;LCR_with_function
942;9776522;Gaze stabilization during dynamic posturography in normal and vestibulopathic humans.;"Dynamic posturography by measurement of center of pressure (COP) is a widely employed technique for evaluating the vestibular system. However, the relationship of COP motion to vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) function and image stability on the retina has not been determined previously. To assess these relationships, we report gaze, head, and trunk stability during dynamic posturography in 11 normal volunteers, 7 subjects with unilateral vestibular lesions, and 3 subjects with bilateral vestibular lesions. Posturographic tasks consisted of standing still and standing on a platform that was sliding (0.2 Hz), tilting (0.1 Hz), or covered with a foam cushion 6 cm thick while tilting (0.1 Hz). Each perturbation was imposed in the anterior-posterior and repeated in the medial-lateral direction, in both light and darkness. Subjects viewed (or in darkness remembered) a target located 50, 100, or 500 cm distant. COP, angular eye position, and angular and linear orbit and trunk positions were measured using magnetic search coils and flux gate magnetometer sensors. With the target visible, the velocity of image motion on the retina was on average always less than 1 degree/s, well within the range consistent with high visual acuity. In darkness, gaze velocity increased for normal and vestibulopathic subjects. During tilt, vestibulopathic subjects had a significantly greater gaze velocity than controls. Gain of the angular VOR (eye velocity/head velocity) was significantly lower in darkness than in light and in vestibulopathic as compared to control subjects. Gain of the VOR was significantly correlated with gaze instability, but variation in VOR gain accounted for only 20-40% of the variance. In darkness, the velocity of the COP was significantly greater in vestibulopathic than control subjects for every condition tested. In light, this difference was small and often not significant. Although spectral analysis of the COP indicated frequencies above 1 Hz that were not observed in motion of the trunk and orbit, root mean square (RMS) velocities of the trunk and orbit in the horizontal plane were higher in darkness and in vestibulopathic subjects, mirroring COP findings. Only in vestibulopathic subjects tested in darkness was there a correlation between COP velocity and gaze velocity; COP velocity was otherwise uncorrelated with gaze. Gaze velocity was greater with near than with distant targets. Vertical VOR gain was higher with near targets. No other significant effects of target distance were found. Head movement strategy, VOR gain, and COP were all unaffected by target proximity. These data show that gaze velocity measurements during dynamic posturography in darkness are sensitive to vestibular loss. With a visible target, both COP and gaze stability of vestibulopathic subjects are difficult to distinguish from normal. During visual feedback, it is likely that image stabilization over the range of frequencies tested is achieved through better head stability and through visual tracking, allowing vestibulopathic subjects to maintain adequate visual acuity.";-;-;-;hard_0
951;12145212;Yhh1p/Cft1p directly links poly(A) site recognition and RNA polymerase II transcription termination.;RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcription termination requires co-transcriptional recognition of a functional polyadenylation signal, but the molecular mechanisms that transduce this signal to pol II remain unclear. We show that Yhh1p/Cft1p, the yeast homologue of the mammalian AAUAAA interacting protein CPSF 160, is an RNA-binding protein and provide evidence that it participates in poly(A) site recognition. Interestingly, RNA binding is mediated by a central domain composed of predicted beta-propeller-forming repeats, which occurs in proteins of diverse cellular functions. We also found that Yhh1p/Cft1p bound specifically to the phosphorylated C-terminal domain (CTD) of pol II in vitro and in a two-hybrid test in vivo. Furthermore, transcriptional run-on analysis demonstrated that yhh1 mutants were defective in transcription termination, suggesting that Yhh1p/Cft1p functions in the coupling of transcription and 3'-end formation. We propose that direct interactions of Yhh1p/Cft1p with both the RNA transcript and the CTD are required to communicate poly(A) site recognition to elongating pol II to initiate transcription termination. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

955;22228096;LRRK2 regulates mitochondrial dynamics and function through direct interaction with DLP1.;The leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) mutations are the most common cause of autosomal-dominant Parkinson disease (PD). Mitochondrial dysfunction represents a critical event in the pathogenesis of PD. We demonstrated that wild-type (WT) LRRK2 expression caused mitochondrial fragmentation along with increased mitochondrial dynamin-like protein (DLP1, also known as DRP1), a fission protein, which was further exacerbated by expression of PD-associated mutants (R1441C or G2019S) in both SH-SY5Y and differentiated primary cortical neurons. We also found that LRRK2 interacted with DLP1, and LRRK2-DLP1 interaction was enhanced by PD-associated mutations that probably results in increased mitochondrial DLP1 levels. Co-expression of dominant-negative DLP1 K38A or WT Mfn2 blocked LRRK2-induced mitochondrial fragmentation, mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal toxicity. Importantly, mitochondrial fragmentation and dysfunction were not observed in cells expressing either GTP-binding deficient mutant LRRK2 K1347A or kinase-dead mutant D1994A which has minimal interaction with DLP1 and did not increase the mitochondrial DLP1 level. We concluded that LRRK2 regulates mitochondrial dynamics by increasing mitochondrial DLP1 through its direct interaction with DLP1, and LRRK2 kinase activity plays a critical role in this process. ;polyleucine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
956;8444340;Characterisation of the gene encoding an unusually divergent TATA-binding protein (TBP) from the extremely A+T-rich human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum.;The intergenic regions of the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, are extreme in their base composition, averaging approx. 90% A + T. As a first step to investigating whether transcription in this organism follows conventional models based largely on yeast, we have isolated and characterised the gene (TBP) encoding its TATA-binding protein (TBP). The gene is present as a single copy on chromosome 5 and is expressed as a 1.8-kb mRNA encoding a protein of 228 amino acids (aa) (26 164 Da). The inferred protein product has a bipartite structure consisting of a 45-aa species-specific N-terminal domain and a 183-aa C-terminal domain. In the latter, the malarial protein contains two directly repeated, but imperfectly homologous regions, each approx. 78 aa in length, together with a highly basic region located between them. These features are characteristic of all TBPs studied to date. Moreover, hydropathy plots suggest that the overall folding of this C-terminal domain is very similar to that of other TBPs. However, TBP from P. falciparum is much less closely related at the primary sequence level to the archetypal yeast homologue than are all other characterised TBPs (42% identity, compared to 76-93%, respectively). Despite this divergence of the primary sequence, most residues known to be involved in DNA binding are conserved. Those instances where sequence variation at generally conserved residues is observed may reflect functional differences that could ultimately be exploited by selective chemotherapy.;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
959;16271865;Bicoid determines sharp and precise target gene expression in the Drosophila embryo.;"The activity of the Bicoid (Bcd) transcription factor is a useful example of how quantitative information contained in a smooth morphogen gradient is transformed into discrete and precise patterns of target gene expression. There are two distinct and important aspects to this process: the ""sharpening"" of the posterior borders of the expression domains and the ""precision"" of where the target genes are expressed along the length of the embryo as the syncytial embryo begins to cellularize. Although the sharpening phenomenon was observed over a decade ago, it is still poorly understood. Here, we show that a Bcd reporter gene containing binding sites only for Bcd is expressed, like natural targets of Bcd, in a precise domain with a sharp boundary. Analysis of embryos expressing deleted forms of Bcd indicates that the sharpness of the Bcd target gene hunchback's expression involves the glutamine-rich and C-terminal activation domains of Bcd. Furthermore, several artificial Gal4-derived transcription factors expressed as gradients in the embryo share Bcd's ability to drive precise target gene expression with sharp boundaries. Thus, contrary to recent reports proposing that the Bcd gradient is not sufficient to establish precise positional information, we show that Bcd drives precise and sharp expression of its target genes through a process that depends exclusively on its ability to activate transcription.

The CIE 1931 (x, y) chromaticity coordinates corresponding to complementary hue perception were subtracted from the chromaticity coordinates of achromatic threshold. The difference was found to be constant irrespective of stimulus size and eccentricity.

It was able to detect purified polyribose phosphate at concentrations of greater than or equal to 1 ng/ml in cerebrospinal fluid. This was 50 times more sensitive than counterimmunoelectrophoresis with the same antiserum. The sensitivity for polyribose phosphate in urine was similar, but that in serum was about 10 times less. Nonspecific reactions were observed with blood-stained cerebrospinal fluid and some sera. These were differentiated from true positive reactions by a blocking test with unconjugated immune serum. A wide range of organisms was tested for cross-reactivity in the assay. With the exception of a protein A-rich strain of Staphylococcus aureus, they gave absorbances of < 8% of that of the homologous system. In a series of five cases of proven H. influenzae type b meningitis, the sensitivity of the assay with cerebrospinal fluid was confirmed to be at least 2(5) times greater than that of counterimmunoelectrophoresis. The results indicate that the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is highly sensitive and specific in detecting H. influenzae type b antigen. The necessity to perform the blocking assay on all sera limits its usefulness for the examination of these specimens. However, it should prove valuable for the detection of the antigen in cerebrospinal fluid and urine.; polyalanine ;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

The backbone of this secondary structural element folds to a triangular form instead of the normal alpha-helix with 3.6 residues per turn. It is a very challenging task to try to detect them computationally from protein sequence. Here, we have studied the preprocessing phase in particular, which is important for any machine learning method. Preprocessing included selection of relevant data from the Protein Data Bank and investigation of learnability properties. These properties show whether the material is suitable for neural network computing. The complexity of algorithms in connection with preprocessing was briefly considered. We found that feedforward perceptron neural networks were appropriate for the prediction of polyproline type II and also relatively efficient in this task. The problem is very difficult because of the great similarity of the two classes present in the classification. Nevertheless, neural networks were able to recognize and predict about 75% of secondary structures. ;polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function

These proteins, Ror1 and Ror2, share 58% overall amino acid identity and a structure indicative of cell surface molecules. A secretion signal sequence and a transmembrane domain delimit the extracellular portion, which contains immunoglobulin-like, cysteine-rich, and kringle domains. The cytoplasmic portion contains the tyrosine kinase-like domain which (in Ror2) appears to be associated with protein kinase activity in vitro, followed by serine/threonine- and proline-rich motifs. Partial nucleotide sequences of the rat genes reveal striking evolutionary conservation of the proteins between human and rat. The level of expression of the rat genes is high in the head and body of early embryo and decreases dramatically after embryonic day 16.

The study shows that administration of low doses (5 mg/week) of antiprogestin results in an increase in the expression of inhibin by the endometrium. Treatment with higher doses (20 mg/week) caused a decrease in the expression. Since treatment with higher doses also caused atropic changes in the endometrium, the decrease in inhibin could be the result of morphological damage to the endometrium rather than the effects of antiprogestin on the expression of inhibin.

We report here the use of site-directed mutagenesis to identify and characterize functional domains within the v-erbA protein. Genetic lesions introduced into a putative hinge region or at the extreme C-terminus of the v-erbA coding domain had no significant effect on the biological activity of this polypeptide. In contrast, mutations introduced within the cysteine-lysine-arginine-rich center of the v-erbA coding region, a DNA-binding domain in the thyroid and steroid hormone receptors, abolished or severely compromised the ability of the viral protein to function. Our results suggest that the mechanism of action of the v-erbA protein in establishing the neoplastic phenotype is closely related to its ability to interact with DNA, presumably thereby altering expression of host target genes by either mimicking or interfering with the action of the normal c-erbA gene product.;polyarginine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Interestingly, peptides consisting of the 23 amino-terminal amino acids of influenza virus hemagglutinin were also active in erythrocyte lysis. When peptides were incorporated into DNA complexes that utilize a receptor-mediated endocytosis pathway for uptake into cultured cells, either by ionic interaction with positively charged polylysine-DNA complexes or by a streptavidin-biotin bridge, a strong correlation between pH-specific erythrocyte disruption activity and gene transfer was observed.

978;21553871;Conformational and aggregation properties of a PEGylated alanine-rich polypeptide.;The conformational and aggregation behavior of PEG conjugates of an alanine-rich polypeptide (PEG-c17H6) were investigated and compared to that of the polypeptide equipped with a deca-histidine tag (17H6). These polypeptides serve as simple and stimuli-responsive models for the aggregation behavior of helix-rich proteins, as our previous studies have shown that the helical 17H6 self-associates at acidic pH and converts to β-sheet structures at elevated temperature under acidic conditions. In the work here, we show that PEG-c17H6 also adopts a helical structure at ambient/subambient temperatures, at both neutral and acidic pH. The thermal denaturation behavior of 17H6 and PEG-c17H6 is similar at neutral pH, where the alanine-rich domain has no self-association tendency. At acidic pH and elevated temperature, however, PEGylation slows β-sheet formation of c17H6, and reduces the apparent cooperativity of thermally induced unfolding. Transmission electron microscopy of PEG-c17H6 conjugates incubated at elevated temperatures showed fibrils with widths of ∼20-30 nm, wider than those observed for fibrils of 17H6. These results suggest that PEGylation reduces β-sheet aggregation in these polypeptides by interfering, only after unfolding of the native helical structure, with interprotein conformational changes needed to form β-sheet aggregates. ;polyalanine;helix;-;LCR_with_function

We identified an important transcriptional regulatory element located between the two TATA boxes that characterize the extensin promoter. Other regulatory elements, located further upstream between -719 to -658, are necessary for maximum level of expression. Employing electrophoretic mobility shift assays and methylation interference experiments, we demonstrate the interaction of nuclear factors with these upstream regulatory elements. In addition to the previously identified factors EGBF-1 and EGBF-2, which are mainly present in unwounded cells, we identified an additional novel DNA-binding activity that is present in extracts prepared from protoplasts but not in extracts from unwounded cells.

A surface protein Ag with a molecular mass of 190 kDa of S. mutans (PAc) is receiving attention as an anticaries vaccine. We have recently determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the gene for PAc. In this study, four peptides were synthesized on the basis of amino acid sequence of PAc. Among these peptides, PAc(301-319) corresponding to the alanine-rich repeating amino acid region was the most strongly bound by polyclonal murine anti-rPAc antibodies. The peptide partially inhibited the binding of polyclonal anti-rPAc antibodies to rPAc. The peptide induced the proliferation of T cells from BALB/c mice immunized with rPAc. Subcutaneous immunization with PAc(301-319) or rPAc emulsified in CFA/IFA induced high serum IgG responses to rPAc and PAc(301-319). In addition, serum IgG responses to a surface protein Ag with a molecular mass of 210 kDa of Streptococcus sobrinus were elicited in mice immunized by s.c. injection with PAc(301-319) or rPAc. Intranasal immunization with PAc(301-319) coupled to cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) or with rPAc and free CTB induced high serum IgG responses to rPAc. The immunization with PAc(301-319) coupled to CTB or rPAc and free CTB suppressed the colonization of murine teeth by S. mutans. These results suggest that intranasal immunization with the peptide or rPAc may be effective for the prevention of dental caries. ;polyalanine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

The present research addresses this question by looking at the domains in which goals are set, focusing on the amount of psychological need satisfaction experienced in these domains. Across three experimental studies, we demonstrate that domain-related need satisfaction predicts the extent to which people adopt self-concordant goals in a given domain, laying the foundation for successful goal pursuit. In addition, we show that need satisfaction influences goal self-concordance because in need-satisfying domains people are both more likely to choose the most self-concordant goal (among a set of comparable choices), and are more likely to internalize the possible goals. The implications of this research for goal setting and pursuit as well as for the importance of examining goals within their broader motivational framework are discussed.;-;-;-;hard_0
992;35781606;Guillain-Barré-like syndrome: an uncommon feature of CASPR2 and LGI1 autoimmunity.;Contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2) and leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) are essential components of the voltage-gated Kv1 potassium channel complex and are extensively expressed in both central and peripheral nervous system. Autoimmune CASPR2 and LGI1 disorders commonly present with Morvan syndrome (Mos) and/or limbic encephalitis, but whether Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a specific clinical phenotype is unknown. Here, we first reported an adult patient with dual CASPR2 and LGI1 antibodies in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid, who initially presented with a GBS-like syndrome and developed a typical MoS and respiratory paralysis, with a rapid resolution of his neurological symptoms and disappearance of autoantibodies after treatment with plasma exchange. Additionally, we also provided an overview of the previously reported GBS cases associated with CASPR2 or LGI1 antibodies. These cases expand the phenotypic spectrum of CASPR2 and LGI1 autoimmune syndromes, implying that these two antigens, especially CASPR2, are likely to participate in the etiology of GBS as a potential new target antigen, which deserves further exploration.;polyleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
997;8128248;Activation of phosphatidylinositol-3' kinase by Src-family kinase SH3 binding to the p85 subunit.;Engagement of antigen receptor complexes induces rapid activation of Src-family kinases and association with phosphatidylinositol-3' kinase (PI-3 kinase). Here it was found that the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of Lyn and Fyn bound to a proline-rich region (residues 84 to 99) within the 85-kilodalton subunit (p85) of PI-3 kinase. The binding of SH3 to the purified kinase led to a five- to sevenfold increase in the specific activity of PI-3 kinase. Ligand-induced receptor stimulation activated PI-3 kinase, and this activation was blocked by a peptide containing residues 84 to 99 of p85. These data demonstrate a mechanism for PI-3 kinase activation and show that binding of SH3 domains to proline-rich target sequences can regulate enzymatic activity.;polyproline;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
1005;2119501;Control of src kinase activity by activators, inhibitors, and substrate chaperones.;The activities of src tyrosine kinases are greatly influenced by substrate modulators (chaperones). In the presence of bovine serum albumin, the phosphorylation of a random polymer of glutamic acid, alanine, and tyrosine (1:1:1) by src kinases is stimulated 20- to 100-fold, but there is little stimulation with a polymer of glutamic acid and tyrosine (4:1) as substrate. This suggests that serum albumin interacts with the substrates rather than with the enzyme. groEL and several other heat shock proteins also stimulate the phosphorylation of a random polymer of glutamic acid, alanine, and tyrosine (1:1:1). In the absence of substrate modulators, the phosphorylation of calmodulin and of several ras proteins by src kinase is barely detectable. In the presence of polylysine or protamine, marked phosphorylation is observed. Another type of control of src kinase activities appears to be directed toward the enzyme rather than the substrate. Triton X-100 extracts of plasma membranes of bovine brain contain a heat-stable factor that stimulates c-src kinase activity with any of the polymers as substrate. The same extract contains a heat-labile factor that preferentially inhibits c-src kinase activity. The two factors are separated by DEAE-Sephacel and phosphocellulose chromatography.

1007;7374218;Vertebral-basilar distribution infarction following chiropractic cervical manipulation.;Previous case reports of vertebral-basilar system infarction following chiropractic cervical manipulation have emphasized the role of predisposing factors such as cervical spondylosis, atherosclerosis, and congenital asymmetry of the posterior circulation. Ten patients without prior neurologic symptoms had vertebral-basilar system infarction promptly after chiropractic maneuvers. One patient, who was free of clinical and radiographic evidence of predisposing factors, subsequently died. Autopsy studies revealed massive nonhemorrhagic brainstem infarction due to bilateral vertebral artery thrombosis. Nine patients survived with residual neurologic deficits due to lesions in various locations of the posterior circulation. No patient received anticoagulants. Previous case reports are summarized and the kinetic anatomy of the vertebral arteries is reviewed to clarify the potential mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of this entity. Although a causal relationship may be difficult to establish in individual cases, cervical manipulation seems to be the major identifiable factor in the pathogenesis of stroke in some patients.;-;-;-;hard_0
1009;30405594;Identification of wysPII as an Activator of Morphological Development in Streptomyces albulus CK-15.;Wuyiencin is produced by Streptomyces albulus var. wuyiensis and used widely in agriculture to control a variety of fungal diseases, such as cucumber downy mildew, strawberry powdery mildew, and tomato gray mold. As an industrially-produced biopesticide, reducing production costs is very important for popularization of this approach. To obtain a rapidly growing strain that effectively shortens the fermentation time, we investigated the effects of knockout and overexpression of the wysPII gene, a member of the LuxR regulatory gene family, in S. albulus strain CK-15. The ΔwysPII mutant exhibited a reduced rate of growth and sporulation. The time taken to reach the greatest mycelial biomass was approximately 18 h shorter in the ooPII (wysPII overexpressing) strain compared with that of the wild-type (WT) strain. In addition, the time to reach the greatest wuyiencin production was 56 h in the ooPII strain compared with 62 h in the WT strain. Furthermore, wysPII was shown to act as an activator of morphological development without affecting wuyiencin production. Thus, the ooPII strain can be used to reduce costs and increase efficiency in industrial fermentation processes for wuyiencin production.;-;-;-;hard_0
1016;23793387;The RRM1 domain of the poly(A)-binding protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is critical to control of mRNA deadenylation.;The poly(A)-binding protein PAB1 from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae plays an important role in controlling mRNA deadenylation rates. Deletion of either its RRM1 or proline-rich domain (P domain) severely restricts deadenylation and slows mRNA degradation. Because these large deletions could be having unknown effects on the structure of PAB1, different strategies were used to determine the importance of the RRM1 and P domains to deadenylation. Since the P domain is quite variable in size and sequence among eukaryotes, P domains from two human PABPCs and from Xenopus were substituted for that of PAB1. The resultant PAB1 hybrid proteins, however, displayed limited or no difference in mRNA deadenylation as compared with PAB1. In contrast to the P domain, the RRM1 domain is highly conserved across species, and a systematic mutagenesis of the RRM1 domain was undertaken to identify its functional regions. Several mutations along the RNA-binding surface of RRM1 inhibited deadenylation, whereas one set of mutations on its exterior non-RNA binding surface shifted deadenylation from a slow distributive process to a rapid processive deadenylation. These results suggest that the RRM1 domain is the more critical region of PAB1 for controlling deadenylation and consists of at least two distinguishable functional regions.  ;polyproline;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
1018;26671978;Genome-Wide Polyadenylation Maps Reveal Dynamic mRNA 3'-End Formation in the Failing Human Heart.;Alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) of mRNA represents a layer of gene regulation that to date has remained unexplored in the heart. This phenomenon may be relevant, as the positioning of the poly(A) tail in mRNAs influences the length of the 3'-untranslated region (UTR), a critical determinant of gene expression. To investigate whether the 3'UTR length is regulated by APA in the human heart and whether this changes in the failing heart. We used 3'end RNA sequencing (e3'-Seq) to directly measure global patterns of APA in healthy and failing human heart specimens. By monitoring polyadenylation profiles in these hearts, we identified disease-specific APA signatures in numerous genes. Interestingly, many of the genes with shortened 3'UTRs in heart failure were enriched for functional groups such as RNA binding, whereas genes with longer 3'UTRs were enriched for cytoskeletal organization and actin binding. RNA sequencing in a larger series of human hearts revealed that these APA candidates are often differentially expressed in failing hearts, with an inverse correlation between 3'UTR length and the level of gene expression. Protein levels of the APA regulator, poly(A)-binding protein nuclear-1 were substantially downregulated in failing hearts. We provide genome-wide, high-resolution polyadenylation maps of the human heart and show that the 3'end formation of mRNA is dynamic in heart failure, suggesting that APA-mediated 3'UTR length modulation represents an additional layer of gene regulation in failing hearts. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
1021;18184719;Embryonic stem cells deficient in I beta1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase exhibit reduced expression of embryoglycan and the loss of a Lewis X antigen, 4C9.;Embryoglycan is a class of branched high-molecular-weight poly-N-acetyllactosamines characteristically expressed in early embryonic cells and has been shown to be involved in the intercellular adhesion of early embryonic cells in vitro. Branching of poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains is performed by beta1,6-N-acetylglucosaminylation of the galactosyl residue. We previously knocked out the gene encoding I beta1, 6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (IGnT), and the resultant deficient mice were born without any abnormality, although the mice exhibited various deficits in later life. In the present investigation, we produced embryonic stem (ES) cells from IGnT-deficient embryos. The mutant ES cells exhibited a reduced capability in embryoglycan synthesis. Thus, IGnT is a major enzyme involved in the branching of poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains in embryoglycan. Since ES cells are equivalent to multipotential cells of the embryonic ectoderm in early postimplantation embryos, this result indicates that an abundance of embryoglycan in these cells is not essential for normal embryogenesis. The IGnT-deficient ES cells continued to express SSEA-1, but lacked the expression of 4C9 antigen, although the epitope of 4C9 antigen was confirmed to be Lewis X by a transfection experiment. The result establishes the distinct nature of 4C9 antigenicity, which requires either Lewis X epitope on I-branch or clustering of Lewis X epitope, best accomplished by poly-N-acetyllactosamine branching. Alpha6-integrin was newly identified as a carrier of embryoglycan. The IGnT-deficient ES cells adhered to dishes coated with laminin, which is a ligand for alpha6-integrin, significantly less than wild-type ES cells, raising the possibility that embryoglycan in ES cells enhances alpha6-integrin-dependent adhesion in vitro. ;polyasparagine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
1023;10068746;[A comparative study of 2 methods of preparation for colonoscopic procedure].;"BACKGROUND
Although ingestion of polyethylene glycol solution has become the standard preparation for colonoscopy since 1980, there is investigation of new safe, comfortable and cheap methods.


OBJECTIVE
We carried out a prospective study in order to compare the utility and tolerance related to the preparation of the colon for colonoscopy, using a dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate enema (SD) versus our conventional preparation.


METHOD
Group A was prepared the day previous to the study with liquid diet, oral laxative and application of an SD, prior to the endoscopy received another SD. Group B was prepared three days with liquid diet, the day previous to the colonoscopy they ingested oral laxative and used a water enema (W(e)), and they used another W(e) the day of the procedure. The patients' tolerance in each case was compared using a scale assigned as good, fair and poor. The cleaning obtained in the colon was also evaluated in a scale of good, regular and bad, considering three colon segments.


RESULTS
Forty-four patients had been studied, 19 men and 25 women; each group with 22 patients. In group A: the preparation tolerance was good in 14 cases (63.6%), fair in seven (31.8%) and poor in one (4.5%); also, the obtained cleaning up to the cecum was good in nine cases (40.9%) and fair in 13 (59%). In group B: the tolerance was good in five cases (22.7%) fair in 12 (54.5%) and poor in five (22.7%); the obtained cleaning in this group up to the cecum was good in two cases (9%), fair in 19 (86.3%) and poor in one (4.5%).


CONCLUSIONS
The SD preparation was better tolerated and more effective in order to achieve the cleaning of the colon than the conventional one.";-;-;-;hard_0
1024;8787556;Cytotoxic effects of an oxidative stress on neuronal-like pheochromocytoma cells (PC12).;"Although the generation of oxygen derivatives during ischemia and reperfusion is generally held as a major event in the process leading to neuronal death, the biochemical mechanisms responsible for cell degeneration remain poorly understood. To better understand the toxicity induced by oxidative stress in neural tissue, we have tested the effect of an exogenous hydroperoxide, cumene hydroperoxide (CHP), on the metabolism and viability of PC12 cells. Addition of CHP in the culture medium leads to significant cell death that becomes perceptible at concentrations above 1 microM and reaches a maximum (80-90% toxicity) at 100 microM. A time-course study shows that Trypan blue uptake is preceded by a rapid phase of cell rounding and detachment from the substratum (within 30 min) followed by a progressive uptake of the dye (60-120 min). During this 2-hr period, we failed to observe any major signs of membrane lipoperoxidation (such as MDA production or fatty acid release). On the other hand, we observed that cell death is preceded by a striking decrease in cellular ATP content and in the retention of rhodamine 123 (within 15-30 min of treatment); thus, suggesting that the mitochondria may be the primary target of hydroperoxide action.";-;-;-;hard_0
1033;8650192;RIG-E, a human homolog of the murine Ly-6 family, is induced by retinoic acid during the differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukemia cell.;In vivo all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), a differentiation inducer, is capable of causing clinical remission in about 90% of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). The molecular basis for the differentiation of APL cells after treatment with ATRA remains obscure and may involve genes other than the known retinoid nuclear transcription factors. We report here the ATRA-induced gene expression in a cell line (NB4) derived from a patient with APL. By differential display-PCR, we isolated and characterized a novel gene (RIG-E) whose expression is up-regulated by ATRA. The gene is 4.0 kb long, consisting of four exons and three introns, and is localized on human chromosome region 8q24. The deduced amino acid sequence predicts a cell surface protein containing 20 amino acids at the N-terminal end corresponding to a signal peptide and an extracellular sequence containing 111 amino acids. The RIG-E coded protein shares some homology with CD59 and with a number of growth factor receptors. It shares high sequence homology with the murine LY-6 multigene family, whose members are small cysteine-rich proteins differentially expressed in several hematopoietic cell lines and appear to function in signal transduction. It seems that so far RIG-E is the closest human homolog of the LY-6 family. Expression of RIG-E is not restricted to myeloid differentiation, because it is also present in thymocytes and in a number of other tissues at different levels.;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
1039;26912148;BTG2 bridges PABPC1 RNA-binding domains and CAF1 deadenylase to control cell proliferation.;While BTG2 plays an important role in cellular differentiation and cancer, its precise molecular function remains unclear. BTG2 interacts with CAF1 deadenylase through its APRO domain, a defining feature of BTG/Tob factors. Our previous experiments revealed that expression of BTG2 promoted mRNA poly(A) tail shortening through an undefined mechanism. Here we report that the APRO domain of BTG2 interacts directly with the first RRM domain of the poly(A)-binding protein PABPC1. Moreover, PABPC1 RRM and BTG2 APRO domains are sufficient to stimulate CAF1 deadenylase activity in vitro in the absence of other CCR4-NOT complex subunits. Our results unravel thus the mechanism by which BTG2 stimulates mRNA deadenylation, demonstrating its direct role in poly(A) tail length control. Importantly, we also show that the interaction of BTG2 with the first RRM domain of PABPC1 is required for BTG2 to control cell proliferation.  ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

1044;7488563;Positive and negative symptoms in neuroleptic-free psychotic inpatients.;Andreasen's scales for the assessment of positive (SAPS) and negative (SANS) symptoms and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) were administered to a group of 70 neuroleptic-free psychotic inpatients. Individual ratings from the SAPS and SANS, together with the 18-item BPRS, were examined to identify clusters of symptoms. The findings, consistent with our previous studies using medicated patients, did not support a simple positive-negative dichotomy. Independent syndromes representing negative symptoms and thought disorder were apparent, although within the negative syndrome there were three related sub-syndromes of flat affect, alogia and social dysfunctions. Hallucinations and delusions did not form a homogeneous group of symptoms. Paranoia emerged as a distinct syndrome, and the remaining symptoms could be subdivided into hallucinations, grandiose delusions, and 'loss of boundary' delusions (e.g., thought broadcasting, mind reading). These syndromes, with the exception of loss of boundary delusions, which consisted of SAPS delusions alone, correspond to syndromes of psychosis identified by Lorr and his colleagues thirty years ago. It is concluded that the currently popular 'three syndrome' model does not adequately represent the diversity of psychotic symptoms.;-;-;-;hard_0

1050;3031687;Molecular structure of mammalian neuropeptide Y: analysis by molecular cloning and computer-aided comparison with crystal structure of avian homologue.;Identification and characterization of the cDNA encoding rat neuropeptide Y revealed the nucleotide sequence coding for a 98-amino acid precursor. The deduced amino acid sequence for rat neuropeptide Y is identical to the human peptide and is highly homologous to avian pancreatic polypeptide. The tertiary structure of avian pancreatic polypeptide has been previously derived from crystallographic data by Blundell and coworkers. The homology between neuropeptide Y and avian pancreatic polypeptide preserves all of the residues essential for the maintenance of the tertiary structure. Thus, it has been possible to compute a three-dimensional model of the mammalian neuropeptide, neuropeptide Y, based on the known structure of the avian homologue. This model suggest that neuropeptide preserves a compact tertiary structure characterized by extensive hydrophobic interactions between an N-terminal polyproline-II-like helix and a C-terminal alpha-helix. The model has been used to identify amino acids residing in key positions within this structure and, thereby, to direct future analysis of neuropeptide Y structure-function relationships.;polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function

(ii) Virus particles irradiated with 800 ergs or more of ultraviolet (UV) light per mm(2) are defective in their ability to initiate viral protein synthesis, but they still inhibit host protein synthesis. After addition of UV-irradiated virus, the decline in host protein synthesis was measured. (iii) Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to distinguish between host- and virus-induced proteins. The following results were obtained. (i) The inhibition of HeLa cell protein synthesis begins within 20 min after infection with purified vaccinia particles. Greater than 95% inhibition occurs within 1 to 4 hr after infection, depending on the viral multiplicity used. (ii) The synthesis of viral ribonucleic acid or viral protein is not required for the inhibition of host protein synthesis. (iii) The ability of the virus particles to inhibit cell protein synthesis is lost after heat or detergent treatment. (iv) The ability of the virus particles to inhibit cell protein synthesis is retained after UV-irradiation. (v) Vaccinia viral protein synthesis in preinfected cells is resistant to the effects of superinfection with UV-irradiated vaccinia particles. (vi) Inhibition of cell protein synthesis is complete and does not involve the continued synthesis of small polypeptide fragments. (vii) A decrease in the size of host polyribosomes rapidly follows infection with vaccinia virus.

1060;8643101;Dependence of the murine antibody response to an anti-CDR2 VH peptide on immunogen formulation.;A peptide corresponding to the second complementarity determining region of the heavy chain (CDR2 VH) from a murine anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody, designated L202, was synthesized by solid phase methodology in a number of different antigenic forms, for the purpose of comparing the effectiveness of different adjuvant-carrier systems in the induction of a murine antibody response against the immunizing peptide and parent antibody molecule. Two of the synthetic constructs contained the palmitoyl and N-palmitoyl-cysteinyl-S-(2,3-palmitoyloxy)-propanediol (PAM3Cys) moieties, respectively, attached to the peptide amino terminus with the immunogen comprising liposomal formulations of each. A third immunogen consisted of the CDR2 VH peptide admixed with the PAM3Cys non-covalently and incorporated into liposomes (PAM3Cys + CDR2 VH). A fourth composition comprised the CDR2 VH peptide conjugated to KLH via the sulfhydryl of an added N terminal cysteine (KLH-CDR2 VH) and injected with Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). A fifth immunogen consisted of the CDR2 VH peptide synthesized on an octameric, branched polylysine core as a multiple antigenic peptide (MAP-CDR2 VH) injected in the presence of Freund's adjuvant. Groups of five mice were injected intramuscularly with each of these immunogens and bled at two week intervals. The highest anti-peptide gamma-immunoglobulin (IgG) responses (against uncoupled peptide by ELISA) after 56 days were obtained with mice receiving the PAM3Cys-CDR2 VH peptide. However, when screened against the CDR2 V(H) peptide present as the MAP derivative by ELISA, IgG raised against the cognate MAP-CDR2 peptide was much more reactive than IgG raised against the liposomal PAM3Cys-CDR2 VH immunogen. In either case, IgG raised against the KLH-CDR2VH conjugate was poorly reactive. These differences in reactivity to the two forms of the CDR2 VH peptide by ELISA did not correspond to major differences in reactivities to the intact L202 Ab by ELISA. Although the IgG against the MAP immunogen was slightly more reactive than the other antisera against the l202 Ab, all titers were less than 1:100. These data illustrate some limitations of using anti-peptide responses as indicators of potential reactivity against the native protein, but suggest that alternate formulations including lipoidal peptides are more effective than corresponding KLH-peptide conjugates in eliciting Ab responses against poorly immunogenic epitopes.;polylysine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

In 220 SUDEP cases with post-mortem examination, we recorded the epileptologist adjudications and medical examiner- and coroner- (ME/C) listed causes of death (CODs). COD diagnosis concordance decreased with NASR's uncertainty in the SUDEP diagnosis: highest for Definite SUDEP (84%, n = 158), lower in Definite Plus (50%, n = 36), and lowest in Possible (0%, n = 18). Rates of psychiatric comorbidity, substance abuse, and toxicology findings for drugs of abuse were all higher in discordant cases than concordant cases. Possible SUDEP cases, an understudied group, were significantly older, and had higher rates of cardiac, drug, or toxicology findings than more certain SUDEP cases. With a potentially contributing or competing COD, ME/Cs favored non-epilepsy-related diagnoses, suggesting a bias toward listing CODs with structural or toxicological findings; SUDEP has no pathognomonic features.

However, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To explore the mechanisms and common factors associated with NADPH oxidase (NOX)-dependent and NOX-independent NETosis, global proteomics and phosphoproteomics analyses are conducted in neutrophils treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), ionomycin, and monosodium urate (MSU). Global proteomic analyses identify 64, 97, and 141 proteins differentially regulated in the PMA, ionomycin, and MSU groups compared with the control group, respectively. Phosphoproteomic analysis identifies 931, 565, and 201 phosphorylation sites differentially regulated in the PMA, ionomycin, and MSU groups, compared with the control, respectively. Overlap analysis of the three comparisons identifies nine proteins and 49 phosphorylation sites derived from 41 phosphoproteins. Among the 41 differentially regulated phosphoproteins, 23 are associated with nuclear function, five with chromatin binding, and 13 with poly(A) RNA binding activities based on GO annotation. Among these, DEK, methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2), and structure-specific recognition protein 1 (SSRP1) are involved in both chromatin and poly(A) RNA binding.

The question of the comparability of BMD data obtained in different centers was examined by comparing the normal range for the lumbar spine and proximal femur in 203 normal white Australian women and 892 normal white U.S. women, obtained using the same model densitometer. The two populations were compared according to decade. From superimposition of the Australian individual values on the North American normal ranges, only minor differences between the two populations were seen at any of the sites measured at any decade. None of these minor differences were statistically significant. This study shows a close similarity between BMD values in both the proximal femur and lumbar spine in normal white women in Australia and North America, provided the same model densitometer is used. Thus data obtained from different centers in populations with similar ethnic composition may be compared directly. These findings provide for the first time a sound basis for the quantitative comparison of the at times conflicting studies carried out in widely differing settings around the world.";-;-;-;hard_0
1076;8944044;Prevalence and significance of pancreatic acinar metaplasia at the gastroesophageal junction.;"Pancreatic acinar metaplasia (PAM), defined as nodules of glandular tissue forming acini composed of cells with coarse apical eosinophilic granules, with or without mucous cells, was recently recognized in gastric mucosa, but its significance is not known. As part of a study on intestinal metaplasia at the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ), we evaluated the prevalence and clinical and histologic correlates of PAM in biopsy specimens from the gastroesophageal squamocolumnar junction. All adult patients having elective upper gastrointestinal endoscopy over a 6-month period were invited to participate. Clinical data and endoscopic findings were recorded. Biopsy specimens, obtained from both sides of the apparent squamocolumnar junction, were processed routinely and reviewed (without knowledge of the clinical data) to evaluate types of epithelium, types and degree of inflammation, and the presence of PAM. The presence or absence of PAM was then correlated with the other histologic findings and with the clinical and endoscopic data. The study comprised 155 patients (79 women, 76 men; 139 white patients, nine black patients, and seven patients of other ethnic groups). Their mean age was 52 years (range: 18-89 years). PAM was present in 37 patients (24%). PAM was not associated with any of the reported symptoms, endoscopic evidence of esophagitis or columnar epithelium in the distal esophagus, or any of the histologic features evaluated, including active esophagitis, intestinal metaplasia at the GEJ, active and chronic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia in the stomach, and Helicobacter infection. Although PAM is present in a considerable proportion (24%) of patients with mucosal biopsy specimens from the squamocolumnar junction, it appears to be an incidental finding unrelated to clinical or histologic abnormalities. We therefore suggest a congenital, rather than an acquired, origin for this entity.";-;-;-;hard_0
1079;2011595;Prediction of the thermodynamics of protein unfolding: the helix-coil transition of poly(L-alanine).;The method given earlier for predicting the thermodynamics of protein unfolding from the x-ray structure of a protein is applied here to the poly(L-alanine) helix. First, the fitting parameters derived earlier from a data base of 10 proteins were used to predict the unfolding thermodynamics of 4 other proteins. The agreement between the observed and predicted values is comparable to that found for the 10 proteins studied initially. Next, the temperature dependences of the Gibbs energy and enthalpy changes for unfolding of bacteriophage T4 lysozyme were predicted and compared with data in the literature. The predicted and observed temperature dependences are similar and the predicted results indicate that cold denaturation should be observed at low temperatures, as observed recently for a T4 lysozyme mutant. The fitting parameters derived from thermodynamic data for protein unfolding and for hydration of model compounds were used to predict the unfolding thermodynamics of the poly(L-alanine) helix. The results predict that helix formation is enthalpy-driven, and the predicted enthalpy change for unfolding (0.86 kcal per mol per residue) is close to the value found in a recent calorimetric study of a 50-residue alanine-rich helix.; polyalanine ;helix;-;LCR_with_function

1089;27847491;Social Threat and Motor Resonance: When a Menacing Outgroup Delays Motor Response.;"Motor resonance (MR) involves the activation of matching motor representations while observing others' actions. Recent research has shown that such a phenomenon is likely to be influenced by higher order variables such as social factors (e.g., ethnic group membership). The present study investigates whether and how the perception of a social threat elicited by an outgroup member and by contextual cues can modulate motor responses while an individual observes others' movements. In an experimental study based on an action observation paradigm, we asked participants to provide answers through computer mouse movements (MouseTracker). We manipulated the agents' group membership (ingroup vs. outgroup) and the social valence of the objects present in a context (neutral vs. threatening) to elicit social menace through contextual cues. Response times and computer mouse trajectories were recorded. The results show a higher level of MR (i.e., participants started to respond earlier and were faster at responding) when observing an action performed by the ingroup members rather than by the outgroup members only when threatening objects are present in a given context. Participants seem to resonate better with their ingroup; conversely, the outgroup member movements tend to delay motor responses. Therefore, we extend prior research going beyond the general ingroup bias effect on MR and showing that the interaction between membership and contextual cues is likely to elicit threat-related stereotypes. Practical implications of these findings are discussed.";-;-;-;hard_0
1091;3191912;Metal binding 'finger' structures in the glucocorticoid receptor defined by site-directed mutagenesis.;The glucocorticoid receptor and the other members of the steroid receptor super-family share a highly conserved, cysteine-rich region which coincides with the DNA binding/transactivating domain. It has been postulated that this region is folded into two 'zinc finger' structures, similar to those originally reported for the transcription factor TFIIIA. The first potential finger domain contains four conserved cysteines and one conserved histidine, while the second contains five conserved cysteines. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have analysed the consequences of altering the proposed finger-like structures. Our results show that most of the mutations affecting the conserved cysteines result in a total loss of glucocorticoid receptor function. In one important exception, however, a conserved cysteine (Cys500) is dispensable for glucocorticoid receptor activity and therefore cannot be involved in complexing a metal ion to form a finger structure. Moreover, the replacement of either Cys476 or Cys482 by His residues maintains partial in vivo activity of the glucocorticoid receptor, while their exchange for an alanine or serine residue, respectively, eliminates receptor function. These results support, at a genetic level, the involvement of cysteines of the glucocorticoid receptor DNA binding domain in metal ion complexation and define the candidate residues involved in such coordination.;polycysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
1094;11222655;Local specification of relative strengths of synapses between different abdominal stretch-receptor axons and their common target neurons.;Stretch-receptor (SR) axons form a parallel array of 20 excitatory synapses with target neurons in the crayfish CNS. In each postsynaptic neuron, EPSPs from different SR axons differ significantly in size. These amplitudes are correlated with the segment in which each axon originates and form a segmental gradient of synaptic excitation in individual postsynaptic neurons. These differences might arise postsynaptically because of differential postsynaptic attenuation or presynaptically because of local regulation of the strength of each synapse. To examine these possibilities, we stimulated each SR axon separately and studied integration of its EPSPs in an identified neuron, Flexor Inhibitor 6 (FI6). Transmission from SR axons to FI6 was chemical and direct: EPSPs were accompanied by an increased postsynaptic conductance, were affected by extracellular Ca(2+), and showed frequency-dependent depression. EPSPs from different SR axons summed linearly. The rise times of EPSPs from different SR axons were not significantly different. We also filled individual SR axons and FI6 neurons and mapped and counted their points of contact. Each SR axon contacted each FI6 bilaterally, and contacts of SR axons from different segments were intermingled on FI6. SR axons that made the strongest synapses made more points-of-contact with FI6. These results imply that differences in strength do not arise because of differential postsynaptic attenuation of EPSPs, but rather because certain SR axons predictably make more points of contact with FI6 than do others. Thus, this gradient in excitation requires that each synapse be regulated by an exchange between the SR axon and its target neuron.;-;-;-;hard_0
1096;24815518;Unusual structural features revealed by the solution NMR structure of the NLRC5 caspase recruitment domain.;The cytosolic nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing receptors (NLRs) are key sensors for bacterial and viral invaders and endogenous stress signals. NLRs contain a varying N-terminal effector domain that regulates the downstream signaling events upon its activation and determines the subclass to which a NLR member belongs. NLRC5 contains an unclassified N-terminal effector domain that has been reported to interact downstream with the tandem caspase recruitment domain (CARD) of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I). Here we report the solution structure of the N-terminal effector domain of NLRC5 and in vitro interaction experiments with the tandem CARD of RIG-I. The N-terminal effector domain of NLRC5 adopts a six α-helix bundle with a general death fold, though it displays specific structural features that are strikingly different from the CARD. Notably, α-helix 3 is replaced by an ordered loop, and α-helix 1 is devoid of the characteristic interruption. Detailed structural alignments between the N-terminal effector domains of NLRC5 with a representative of each death-fold subfamily showed that NLRC5 fits best to the CARD subfamily and can be called an atypical CARD. Due to the specific structural features, the atypical CARD also displays a different electrostatic surface. Because the shape and charge of the surface is crucial for the establishment of a homotypic CARD-CARD interaction, these specific structural features seem to have a significant effect on the interaction between the atypical CARD of NLRC5 and the tandem RIG-I CARD.  ;polyleucine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
1097;8914996;Metal-dependent alpha-helix formation promoted by the glycine-rich octapeptide region of prion protein.;Prion diseases share a common feature in that the normal cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) converts to a protease-resistant isoform PrP(Sc). The alpha-helix-rich C-terminal half of PrP(C) is partly converted into beta-sheet in PrP(Sc). We have examined by Raman spectroscopy the structure of an octapeptide PHGGGWGQ that appears in the N-terminal region of PrP(C) and a longer peptide containing the octapeptide region. The peptides do not assume any regular structure without divalent metal ions, whereas Cu(II) binding to the HGGG segment induces formation of alpha-helical structure on the C-terminal side of the peptide chain. The N-terminal octapeptide of prion protein may be a novel structural motif that acts as a promoter of alpha-helix formation.; polyglycine ;helix;-;LCR_with_function
1098;7270923;An ultrastructural morphometric study of developing rat substantia gelatinosa.;A morphometric analysis has been done on developing rat substantia gelatinosa of the lower cervical and upper thoracic levels of the spinal cord starting on the 15th day of gestation. The following parameters were measured: cell body diameter, cytoplasmic/nuclear areas, synaptic density, synaptic type and vesicle morphology of the presynaptic terminal in axodendritic synapses. Cell body size and cytoplasmic/nuclear areas of gelatinosal cells increase until the 15th day postnatally and then decrease somewhat to the adult values. The first synapses are seen on gestation day 17. Synaptic density increases linearly until the third day postnatally. Axodendritic synapses are most common throughout development and in the adult, while the proportion of axoaxonic synapses increases and axosomatic synapses decreases during development. Most of the terminals in axodendritic synapses contain clear-spherical vesicles but the occurrence of clear-flat vesicles and dense-cored vesicles in the terminals increases during development. It appears that these morphological parameters provide a stable index of development in the substantia gelatinosa which can be correlated with functional devleopment of the area. Hopefully, they will provide a means to asses subtle anomalies induced by nonteratogenic drugs or other environmental changes.;-;-;-;hard_0

This could also be prepared by hydrogenation of the benzyloxy derivative 5. Reaction of 3,6-pyridazinediol (10) with 1 (R = CN) gave the 4-[(1,6-dihydro-6-oxo-3-pyridazinyl)oxy] compound 11a, which in turn rearranged on heating with NaH in DMSO into the 4-(1,6-dihydro-3-hydroxy-6-oxo-1-pyridazinyl) compound 12. A series of 6-substituted analogues (R = CO2Me, CSNH2, NO2, Br) of 3a and 11a were synthesized. N-Alkylation led to compounds 14a-c (R = Me, Et, CHMe2). The 4-heterocyclyloxychromenes 9 and 16a were obtained by alkaline hydrolysis of their 3-camphorsulfonates.

1110;33486697;DNA-binding properties of the MADS-domain transcription factor SEPALLATA3 and mutant variants characterized by SELEX-seq.;We studied the DNA-binding profile of the MADS-domain transcription factor SEPALLATA3 and mutant variants by SELEX-seq. DNA-binding characteristics of SEPALLATA3 mutant proteins lead us to propose a novel DNA-binding mode. MIKC-type MADS-domain proteins, which function as essential transcription factors in plant development, bind as dimers to a 10-base-pair AT-rich motif termed CArG-box. However, this consensus motif cannot fully explain how the abundant family members in flowering plants can bind different target genes in specific ways. The aim of this study was to better understand the DNA-binding specificity of MADS-domain transcription factors. Also, we wanted to understand the role of a highly conserved arginine residue for binding specificity of the MADS-domain transcription factor family. Here, we studied the DNA-binding profile of the floral homeotic MADS-domain protein SEPALLATA3 by performing SELEX followed by high-throughput sequencing (SELEX-seq). We found a diverse set of bound sequences and could estimate the in vitro binding affinities of SEPALLATA3 to a huge number of different sequences. We found evidence for the preference of AT-rich motifs as flanking sequences. Whereas different CArG-boxes can act as SEPALLATA3 binding sites, our findings suggest that the preferred flanking motifs are almost always the same and thus mostly independent of the identity of the central CArG-box motif. Analysis of SEPALLATA3 proteins with a single amino acid substitution at position 3 of the DNA-binding MADS-domain further revealed that the conserved arginine residue, which has been shown to be involved in a shape readout mechanism, is especially important for the recognition of nucleotides at positions 3 and 8 of the CArG-box motif. This leads us to propose a novel DNA-binding mode for SEPALLATA3, which is different from that of other MADS-domain proteins known.;polythreonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
1112;8877013;Protein tyrosine kinase activity in 350 T1/T2, N0/N1 breast cancer. Preliminary results.;Protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) are a family of enzymes sharing a highly conserved catalytic domain which phosphorylates substrate proteins on tyrosine residues. PTKs play a major role in the transduction of the mitogenic signal and are involved in the control of cell proliferation, differentiation, and transformation processes. PTKs can be subdivided into two major types: membrane associated PTKs consisting essentially of growth factor receptors (receptor tyrosine kinases or RTKs) and cytosolic PTKs involved in the intracellular transduction of mitogenic and differentiation signals. From January 1988 to January 1992, PTK activity was assayed in cytosolic fractions prepared from 350 T1-T2, N0-N1 M0, breast carcinomas. Enzymatic activity was measured using phosphate transfer from [32P]-ATP to poly-Glu-Tyr as an artificial substrate. According to our previously reported pilot study, we chose a cut-off value of 12 pmol 32P incorporated min-1 mg-1 protein, corresponding to the median value. We found positive PTK levels (> or = 12 pmol/min/mg) to be correlated with a loss of differentiation according to Scarff-Bloom grade (p < 0.001), negative PR (p = 0.03) and ER status (p = 0.04). With a median follow-up of 30 months (0-82), patients with a positive PTK level presented a smaller 3-year disease free survival than in the PTK negative group of patients (p = 0.07).

1113;35098656;Roles of Myc-associated zinc finger protein in malignant tumors.;As an important transcription factor that is widely expressed in most tissues of the human body, Myc-associated zinc finger protein (MAZ) has been reported highly expressed in many malignant tumors and thought to be a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatment. In this review, we aim to offer a comprehensive understanding of MAZ regulation in malignant tumors. The carboxy terminal of MAZ protein contains six C2H2 zinc fingers, and its regulation of transcription is based on the interaction between the GC-rich DNA binding sites of target genes and its carboxy-terminal zinc finger motifs. MAZ protein has been found to activate or inhibit the transcriptional initiation process of many target genes, as well as play an important role in the transcriptional termination process of some target genes, so MAZ poses dual regulatory functions in the initiation and termination process of gene transcription. Through the transcriptional regulation of c-myc and Ras gene family, MAZ poses an important role in the occurrence and development of breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, glioblastoma, neuroblastoma, and other malignant tumors. Our review shows a vital role of MAZ in many malignant tumors and provides novel insight for cancer diagnosis and treatment.;polycysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function

EV71 nonstructural protein 2C participates in many critical events throughout the virus life cycle; however, its precise role is not fully understood. Lack of a high-resolution structure made it difficult to elucidate 2C activity and prevented inhibitor development. We report the 2.5 Å-resolution crystal structure of the soluble part of EV71 2C, containing an adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) domain, a cysteine-rich zinc finger with an unusual fold, and a carboxyl-terminal helical domain. Unlike other AAA+ ATPases, EV71 2C undergoes a carboxyl terminus-mediated self-oligomerization, which is dependent on a specific interaction between the carboxyl-terminal helix of one monomer and a deep pocket formed between the ATPase and the zinc finger domains of the neighboring monomer. The carboxyl terminus-mediated self-oligomerization is fundamental to 2C ATPase activity and EV71 replication.

Appropriate equipment modifications can render commercially available autotransfusion devices safer and more effective in the management of intraoperative blood loss.

1122;18849972;Anchored plasticity opens doors for selective inhibitor design in nitric oxide synthase.;Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzymes synthesize nitric oxide, a signal for vasodilatation and neurotransmission at low concentrations and a defensive cytotoxin at higher concentrations. The high active site conservation among all three NOS isozymes hinders the design of selective NOS inhibitors to treat inflammation, arthritis, stroke, septic shock and cancer. Our crystal structures and mutagenesis results identified an isozyme-specific induced-fit binding mode linking a cascade of conformational changes to a new specificity pocket. Plasticity of an isozyme-specific triad of distant second- and third-shell residues modulates conformational changes of invariant first-shell residues to determine inhibitor selectivity. To design potent and selective NOS inhibitors, we developed the anchored plasticity approach: anchor an inhibitor core in a conserved binding pocket, then extend rigid bulky substituents toward remote specificity pockets, which become accessible upon conformational changes of flexible residues. This approach exemplifies general principles for the design of selective enzyme inhibitors that overcome strong active site conservation.;-;-;-;hard_0

1131;23532859;Cis-regulatory sequence variation and association with Mycoplasma load in natural populations of the house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus).;Characterization of the genetic basis of fitness traits in natural populations is important for understanding how organisms adapt to the changing environment and to novel events, such as epizootics. However, candidate fitness-influencing loci, such as regulatory regions, are usually unavailable in nonmodel species. Here, we analyze sequence data from targeted resequencing of the cis-regulatory regions of three candidate genes for disease resistance (CD74, HSP90α, and LCP1) in populations of the house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus) historically exposed (Alabama) and naïve (Arizona) to Mycoplasma gallisepticum. Our study, the first to quantify variation in regulatory regions in wild birds, reveals that the upstream regions of CD74 and HSP90α are GC-rich, with the former exhibiting unusually low sequence variation for this species. We identified two SNPs, located in a GC-rich region immediately upstream of an inferred promoter site in the gene HSP90α, that were significantly associated with Mycoplasma pathogen load in the two populations. The SNPs are closely linked and situated in potential regulatory sequences: one in a binding site for the transcription factor nuclear NFYα and the other in a dinucleotide microsatellite ((GC)6). The genotype associated with pathogen load in the putative NFYα binding site was significantly overrepresented in the Alabama birds. However, we did not see strong effects of selection at this SNP, perhaps because selection has acted on standing genetic variation over an extremely short time in a highly recombining region. Our study is a useful starting point to explore functional relationships between sequence polymorphisms, gene expression, and phenotypic traits, such as pathogen resistance that affect fitness in the wild. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
1132;12947119;Specific interaction of Egr1 and c/EBPbeta leads to the transcriptional activation of the human low density lipoprotein receptor gene.;The sterol-independent regulatory element (SIRE) of the LDL receptor (LDLR) promoter mediates oncostatin M (OM)-induced transcription of the LDLR gene through a cholesterol-independent pathway. Our prior studies have detected specific associations of the zinc finger transcription factor Egr1 with the SIRE sequence in OM-stimulated HepG2 cells. Because the SIRE motif is composed of a c/EBP binding site and a cAMP response element, both of which are quite divergent from the classical GC-rich Egr1 recognition sequences, we hypothesized that Egr1 may regulate LDLR transcription through interacting with members of the c/EBP and CREB families. Here, we show that treating HepG2 cells with OM specifically leads to prominent increases of the levels of c/EBPbeta and Egr1 bound to the LDLR promoter in vivo. In vitro, the binding of Egr1 to the SIRE sequence is weak, but is strikingly enhanced in the presence of HepG2 nuclear extract. Mammalian two-hybrid assays demonstrate that the N-terminal transactivation domain of Egr1 specifically interacts with c/EBPbeta but not with c/EBPalpha or CREB. The OM treatment further enhances this interaction, resulting in a large increase in the Egr1 transactivating activity. The direct protein to protein contact between Egr1 and c/EBPbeta is also demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Furthermore, we show that a mutation of the phosphorylation motif of c/EBPbeta diminished the OM-stimulated interaction of Egr1 and c/EBPbeta. Taken together, we provide strong evidence that Egr1 regulates LDLR transcription via a novel mechanism of protein-protein interaction with c/EBPbeta. ;polycysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
1135;20580677;Rev-derived peptides inhibit HIV-1 replication by antagonism of Rev and a co-receptor, CXCR4.;Rev, a viral regulatory protein of HIV-1, binds through its arginine-rich domain to the Rev-responsive element (RRE), a secondary structure in transcribed HIV-1 RNA. Binding of Rev to RRE mediates export of singly spliced or unspliced mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. It has been previously shown that a certain arginine-rich peptide exhibits not only RRE-binding ability but also cell permeability and antagonism of CXCR4, one of the major coreceptors of HIV-1. Here we designed and synthesized arginine-rich peptides derived from the RNA-binding domain of Rev (Rev(34-50)) and evaluated their anti-HIV-1 activities. Rev(34-50)-A(4)C, comprising Rev(34-50) with AAAAC at the C-terminus to increase the alpha-helicity, inhibited HIV-1 entry by CXCR4 antagonism and virus production in persistently HIV-1-infected PM1-CCR5 cells. Interestingly, similar motif of human lymphotropic virus type I Rex (Rex(1-21)) also exerted moderate anti-HIV-1 activity.

To update the 1984 recommendations of the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination on the routine screening of asymptomatic patients for infection with Chlamydia trachomatis.


OPTIONS
Screening, with the use of culture or nonculture tests, of the general population, of certain high-risk groups or of all pregnant women; or no routine screening.


OUTCOMES
Rates of asymptomatic and symptomatic chlamydial infection, perinatal complications, longterm complications of infection (i.e., pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility and ectopic pregnancy), coinfection with other sexually transmitted diseases, disease spread, hospital care, complications of therapy and costs of infection and of screening.


EVIDENCE
Search of MEDLINE for articles published between Jan. 1, 1983, and Dec. 31, 1995, with the use of the major MeSH heading ""chlamydial infections,"" references from recent review articles and recommendation by other organizations.


VALUES
The evidence-based methods of the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination were used. Advice from reviewers and experts and recommendations of other organizations were taken into consideration. Prevention of symptomatic disease and decreased overall costs were given high values.


BENEFITS, HARMS AND COSTS
The greatest potential benefits of screening asymptomatic patients for chlamydial infections are the prevention of complications, especially infertility and perinatal complications, and the prevention of disease spread. There is no evidence that screening of the general population for chlamydial infections leads to a reduction in complications, and screening may increase costs. However, there is evidence that annual screening of selected high-risk groups and of pregnant women during the first trimester is beneficial in preventing symptoms and reducing the overall cost resulting from infection.


RECOMMENDATIONS
There is fair evidence to support screening and treatment of pregnant women during the first trimester (grade B recommendation) as well as annual screening and treatment of high-risk groups (sexually active women less than 25 years of age, men or women with new or multiple sexual partners during the preceding year, women who use nonbarrier contraceptive methods and women who have symptoms of chlamydial infection: cervical friability, mucopurulent cervical discharge or intermenstrual bleeding; grade B recommendation). There is fair evidence to exclude routine screening of the general population (grade D recommendation).


VALIDATION
These recommendations are similar to those of the US Preventive Services Task Force and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta.

1141;29085724;Diffuse neonatal hemangiomatosis presenting as congestive heart failure.;Diffuse neonatal hemangiomatosis is a rare condition with a very high mortality rate if left untreated. We report a neonate having around 490 cutaneous and multiple diffuse liver hemangiomas presenting as congestive heart failure. Prompt treatment was instituted with decongestive drugs and prednisolone for anticipated life threatening complications due to hepatic hemangiomas. Propranolol was added later as it is known to precipitate congestive failure and also to avoid long-term complications of steroids. The child responded well. However, there is no consensus regarding the initial line of management, which needs to be individualized keeping in mind the efficacy, long-term side effects of the drug and the clinical presentation.;-;-;-;hard_0
1142;9030545;The human POLD1 gene. Identification of an upstream activator sequence, activation by Sp1 and Sp3, and cell cycle regulation.;The promoter of the human POLD1 gene encoding the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase delta is G/C-rich and does not contain a TATA box. Transient transfection analysis in HeLa cells employing POLD1-luciferase chimeric plasmids revealed a core promoter region extending 328 base pairs (bp) from the major transcription initiation site. Multiple elements in this region including two 11-bp direct repeats located between nucleotide positions -92 and -22, play an important role in POLD1 promoter activity. Deletion or linker-replacement mutations of the repeats drastically reduced the promoter activity. A 70-bp DNA fragment containing the two repeats could stimulate the expression of the POLD1 or a heterologous promoter in an orientation-independent manner. DNase I footprinting and band-shift assays showed that HeLa nuclear extracts contained proteins specifically binding to the repeat sequences. Southwestern blot and UV cross-linking analyses identified Sp1 and two 85-kDa proteins that bound to the repeats. Additionally, screening of HeLa cDNA expression libraries for the sequence-specific DNA-binding protein using the 11-bp repeat sequences as the probe, identified a cDNA that corresponds to Sp3, a member of the Sp1 family. Cotransfection studies in Drosophila SL2 cells showed that both Sp1 and Sp3, but not Sp2, could activate the POLD1 promoter through the repeat sequences. The POLD1 promoter activity was induced about 4-fold at the late G1/S boundary in serum-stimulated cells. The 11-bp repeats together with an E2F-like sequence, located adjacent to the major transcription initiation site, were important for the stimulation. Taken together, this study provides a direct evidence for transcriptional regulation of the human POLD1 gene.;polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
1143;3363867;Isolation and characterization of monoclonal antibodies against the adenovirus core proteins.;Monoclonal antibodies have been prepared that recognize adenovirus core proteins V, VII, and mu in ELISA and Western blot assays. Antibodies produced by all of 87 positive hybridoma colonies obtained from a mouse injected with the precursor to protein VII, pVII, produced antibodies that also reacted with purified protein VII in an ELISA assay and all tested recognized denatured protein VII immobilized on nitrocellulose. Such failure to recover antibodies that specifically recognized only protein pVII suggests that epitopes common to the 174 amino acid protein VII and its 197 amino acid precursor were more effective antigenic determinants than the N-terminal 23 amino acid segment unique to pVII. All antibodies raised against protein mu cross-reacted with protein VII in both assays, but only a small fraction of the anti-protein VII or pVII antibodies recognized protein mu. Such cross-reactivity is discussed in relation to an unusual, arginine-rich sequence present in both protein VII and protein mu.;polyarginine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

1153;7490144;Hypertension prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control in Egypt. Results from the Egyptian National Hypertension Project (NHP). NHP Investigative Team.;This report from the Egyptian National Hypertension Project presents national estimates of the prevalence of hypertension and the extent to which high blood pressure is being detected, treated with medications, and controlled in the Egyptian population. The results are based on findings from a national probability survey of adults > or = 25 years of age conducted in six Egyptian governorates. With the use of a stratified multistage probability design, 6733 people (85% response rate) were examined. Hypertension was defined as systolic pressure > or = 140 mm Hg, and/or diastolic pressure > or = 90 mm Hg, and/or reported treatment with one or more antihypertensive medications. Overall, the estimated prevalence of hypertension in Egypt was 26.3%. Hypertension prevalence increased progressively with age, from 7.8% in 25- to 34-year-olds to 56.6% in those 75 years or older. Hypertension was slightly more common in women than in men (26.9% versus 25.7%, respectively). Overall, 37.5% of hypertensive individuals were aware that they had high blood pressure, 23.9% were being treated with antihypertensive medications, and 8.0% were under control (systolic pressure < 140 mm Hg and diastolic pressure < 90 mm Hg). Hypertension prevalence as well as awareness, treatment, and control rates varied by region, with Cairo having the highest prevalence (31.0%) and the Coastal Region having the highest control rate (15.9%). Rates of awareness, treatment, and control tended to be lowest in areas of lower socioeconomic status. Our results indicate that hypertension is highly prevalent in Egypt and that the rates of hypertension is awareness, treatment, and control are relatively low.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS);-;-;-;hard_0
1155;25533001;Computational modeling suggests dimerization of equine infectious anemia virus Rev is required for RNA binding.;The lentiviral Rev protein mediates nuclear export of intron-containing viral RNAs that encode structural proteins or serve as the viral genome. Following translation, HIV-1 Rev localizes to the nucleus and binds its cognate sequence, termed the Rev-responsive element (RRE), in incompletely spliced viral RNA. Rev subsequently multimerizes along the viral RNA and associates with the cellular Crm1 export machinery to translocate the RNA-protein complex to the cytoplasm. Equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) Rev is functionally homologous to HIV-1 Rev, but shares very little sequence similarity and differs in domain organization. EIAV Rev also contains a bipartite RNA binding domain comprising two short arginine-rich motifs (designated ARM-1 and ARM-2) spaced 79 residues apart in the amino acid sequence. To gain insight into the topology of the bipartite RNA binding domain, a computational approach was used to model the tertiary structure of EIAV Rev. The tertiary structure of EIAV Rev was modeled using several protein structure prediction and model quality assessment servers. Two types of structures were predicted: an elongated structure with an extended central alpha helix, and a globular structure with a central bundle of helices. Assessment of models on the basis of biophysical properties indicated they were of average quality. In almost all models, ARM-1 and ARM-2 were spatially separated by >15 Å, suggesting that they do not form a single RNA binding interface on the monomer. A highly conserved canonical coiled-coil motif was identified in the central region of EIAV Rev, suggesting that an RNA binding interface could be formed through dimerization of Rev and juxtaposition of ARM-1 and ARM-2. In support of this, purified Rev protein migrated as a dimer in Blue native gels, and mutation of a residue predicted to form a key coiled-coil contact disrupted dimerization and abrogated RNA binding. In contrast, mutation of residues outside the predicted coiled-coil interface had no effect on dimerization or RNA binding. Our results suggest that EIAV Rev binding to the RRE requires dimerization via a coiled-coil motif to juxtapose two RNA binding motifs, ARM-1 and ARM-2. ;polyarginine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
1157;35554690;DFT exploration of adsorptive performances of borophene to small sulfur-containing gases.;"Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were applied to study the ability of B36 to adsorb H2S, SO2, SO3, CH3SH, (CH3)2S, and C4H4S gases. Several exchange-correlation including B97D, PBE, B3LYP, M062X, and WB97XD were utilized to evaluate adsorption energies. The initial results showed that boundary boron atoms are the most appropriate interaction sites. The adsorption energies, electron density, electron localized function, and differential charge density plots confirmed the formation of chemical covalent bonds only between SOx and B36. The results of thermochemistry analysis revealed the exothermic nature of the adsorption of sulfur-containing gases on B36; the highest values of ∆H298 were found for SO3/B36 and SO2/B36 systems. The electronic absorption spectra and DOS of B36 did not exhibit significant variations after gases adsorption, while the modeled CD spectra showed a remarkable change in the case of the SOx/B36 system. Accordingly, B36 is not suggested for detecting the studied gases. The effect of imposing mono vacancy defect and external electric field to the adsorption of titled gases on the sorbent showed, while the former did not affect the adsorption energies significantly the later improved the adsorption of gas molecules on the B36 system. The results of the current study could provide deeper molecular insight on the removal of SOx gases by B36 system.";-;-;-;hard_0
1158;6085187;Prevention of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis in rats by fetal alpha-fetoprotein-rich fractions.;Rats immunized with Torpedo acetylcholine receptor (AChR) developed experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG) manifested by an early acute phase and a late chronic phase. In the animals the acute and the chronic diseases were prevented by the administration of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)-rich fractions obtained from human amniotic fluid and umbilical cord serum. Both the clinical and the electromyographic manifestations of EAMG was affected by AFP treatment. The anti-AChR antibody level as well as the cellular immune response to AChR were also affected by AFP. Rats immunized with Torpedo AChR and treated with AFP-rich fractions showed low levels of antibodies to rat AChR, and an inhibited proliferation response of lymphocytes to the antigen AChR. The addition of AFP in vitro to the lymphocyte culture significantly inhibited the proliferative response to AChR and to the mitogen phytohemagglutinin. AFP is present in high amounts during pregnancy, and therefore the present findings suggest that clinical remissions of myasthenia gravis during the second half of pregnancy may be attributed to the immunosuppressive effect of AFP.;polyproline;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
1161;25731919;Molecular characterization and expression analysis of eleven interferon regulatory factors in half-smooth tongue sole, Cynoglossus semilaevis.;"Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) act as transcription mediators in virus-, bacteria-, and interferon (IFN)-induced signaling pathways and play diverse functions in antimicrobial defense, immune modulation, hematopoietic differentiation, and cell apoptosis. In this study, we described for the first time eleven IRFs (IRF1, IRF1L, IRF2X1, IRF3, IRF4a, IRF4b, IRF5, IRF6, IRF7, IRF8, and IRF9) from half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) and examined their tissue distributions and expression patterns under different conditions. The deduced protein sequences of these IRFs (except IRF1) share high identities (71.8-86.6%) with other corresponding IRFs in other teleosts, whereas the sequence identity of IRF1 with the corresponding IRF1 in other teleosts is only 58.1%. A conserved N-terminal DNA binding domain (DBD), which is characterized by a winged type helix-loop-helix motif with four to six tryptophan repeats, is present in all IRFs. Another conserved IRF associated domain (IAD), which mediates the interactions in the C-terminal part of the protein, is present in all IRFs except IRF1 and IRF2X1, which instead contain the IAD2 domain. Several special domains also were found, including a serine-rich domain (SRD) in IRF3, IRF4a, IRF4b, and IRF7; a proline-rich domain (PRD) in IRF9; nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in IRF5, IRF8, and IRF9; and a virus activated domain (VAD) in IRF5. Quantitative real time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that expression of all IRFs occurred in multiple tissues. IRF1, IRF2X1, IRF4a, IRF5, IRF7, and IRF8 exhibited relatively high levels of expression in immune organs, whereas the other five IRFs displayed high levels of expression in non-immune organs. Infection with extracellular and intracellular bacterial pathogens and virus upregulated the expression of IRFs in a manner that depended on tissue type, pathogen, and infection stage. Specifically, IRF1 and IRF2X1 were highly induced by bacterial and viral pathogens; IRF1L and IRF6 responded mainly to extracellular and intracellular bacterial pathogens; IRF3, IRF5, IRF7, IRF8, and IRF9 were markedly induced by intracellular bacterial pathogen and virus; IRF4a and IRF4b were mainly induced by virus and intracellular bacterial pathogen respectively. These results indicate that the IRFs of C. semilaevis can be categorized into several groups which exhibit different expression patterns in response to the infection of different microbial pathogens. These results provide new insights into the roles of teleost IRFs in antimicrobial immunity. ";polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function
1167;29095255;Both plasma and tumor tissue miR-146a high expression correlates with prolonged overall survival of surgical patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.;The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of tumor tissue and plasma miR-146a/b expressions with the clinicopathological properties and overall survival (OS) in surgical patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (ICC).Eighty-seven patients with ICC were enrolled. Tumor tissue and plasma sample were collected and miR-146a/b expressions were assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The median follow-up duration was 31 months, and the last follow-up date was January 2017.miR-146a (P < .001) and miR-146b (P = .006) expressions in tumor tissue were positively associated with that in plasma. Tissue miR-146a was negatively correlated with age (P = .036), poor differentiation (P = .020), N stage (P = .020), and TNM stage (P = .007), as well as ECOG performance (P = .008), whereas plasma miR-146a was inversely associated with N stage (P = .003), TNM stage (P = .003), and ECOG performance (P = .011). Moreover, tissue miR-146b was negatively correlated with gender (P = .043) and T stage (P = .047). Kaplan-Meier curves suggested that high expression of tissue miR-146a (P < .001) and plasma miR-146a (P = .029) were correlated with prolonged OS. Nevertheless, no association of miR-146b expression in tumor tissue (P = .187) and plasma (P = .336) with OS was discovered. Univariate analysis indicated that both tissue miR-146a (P < .001) and plasma miR-146a (P = .035) could predict better OS, whereas multivariate analysis revealed that only tissue miR-146a (P = .001) high expression was an independent factor for prolonged OS.Both plasma and tissue miR-146a expression correlated with favorable OS, whereas only tissue miR-146a was an independent prognostic biomarker in surgical patients with ICC.;-;-;-;hard_0
1169;8321202;The genomic structure of the murine ICSBP gene reveals the presence of the gamma interferon-responsive element, to which an ISGF3 alpha subunit (or similar) molecule binds.;ICSBP, a member of the interferon regulatory factor family, is expressed predominantly in lymphoid tissues and is induced by gamma interferon (IFN-gamma). We have studied the genomic organization of the murine ICSBP gene and its 5' upstream region. The murine ICSBP gene (Icsbp) is present as a single copy on chromosome 8 and consists of nine exons. Transcription initiates at two juxtaposed sites downstream from the TATA and CAAT boxes and produces two species of ICSBP mRNA (3.0 and 1.7 kb), presumably by differential usage of poly(A)+ signals. A sequence from -175 to -155 was identified to be an IFN response region that conferred IFN-gamma induction upon a heterologous promoter in lymphoid cell line EL4. This region includes a motif, TTCNNGGAA, designated the palindromic IFN response element (pIRE), to which an IFN-gamma-inducible, cycloheximide-sensitive factor(s) binds. A similar palindromic motif was found in the upstream region of the murine IRF-1 gene, the IFN-gamma activation site of the guanylate-binding protein gene and the IFN-gamma-responsive region of the Fc receptor type I gene, all of which competed with the pIRE for factor binding in gel mobility shift assays. We show that the pIRE binding factor reacts with the antibody against the 91-kDa subunit of ISGF3 alpha recently shown to bind to the IFN-gamma activation site. These results suggest that this factor is related to the IFN-gamma activation factor and contains the 91-kDa subunit of ISGF3 alpha. Taken together, pIRE represents an IRE that is distinct from the classical IFN-stimulated response element and that is capable of conferring IFN-gamma induction through the binding of the 91-kDa ISGF3 alpha subunit (or an antigenically similar molecule). ;polyalanine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

1175;11115515;Nuclear import and export signals enable rapid nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the atypical protein kinase C lambda.;The atypical protein kinase C (PKC) isoenzymes, lambda/iota- and zetaPKC, play important roles in cellular signaling pathways regulating proliferation, differentiation, and cell survival. By using green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins, we found that wild-type lambdaPKC localized predominantly to the cytoplasm, whereas both a kinase-defective mutant and an activation loop mutant accumulated in the nucleus. We have mapped a functional nuclear localization signal (NLS) to the N-terminal part of the zinc finger domain of lambdaPKC. Leptomycin B treatment induced rapid nuclear accumulation of GFP-lambda as well as endogenous lambdaPKC suggesting the existence of a CRM1-dependent nuclear export signal (NES). Consequently, we identified a functional leucine-rich NES in the linker region between the zinc finger and the catalytic domain of lambdaPKC. The presence of both the NLS and NES enables a continuous shuttling of lambdaPKC between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Our results suggest that the exposure of the NLS in both lambda- and zetaPKC is regulated by intramolecular interactions between the N-terminal part, including the pseudosubstrate sequence, and the catalytic domain. Thus, either deletion of the N-terminal region, including the pseudosubstrate sequence, or a point mutation in this sequence leads to nuclear accumulation of lambdaPKC. The ability of the two atypical PKC isoforms to enter the nucleus in HeLa cells upon leptomycin B treatment differs substantially. Although lambdaPKC is able to enter the nucleus very rapidly, zetaPKC is much less efficiently imported into the nucleus. This difference can be explained by the different relative strengths of the NLS and NES in lambdaPKC compared with zetaPKC. ;polyleucine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
1176;10559384;Cell type-specific activation of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit genes by Sox10.;The regulatory factor Sox10 is expressed in neural crest derivatives during development as well as in the adult CNS and peripheral nervous system. Mutations of the human Sox10 gene have been identified in patients with Waardenburg-Hirschsprung syndrome that is characterized by defects in neural crest development. Previous studies suggested that Sox10 might function as an important transcriptional regulator of neural crest development. No natural target genes of Sox10 have yet been identified. Although human Sox10 activates a synthetic promoter consisting of a TATA box and multiple Sox consensus sequences, no transcriptional activity of the rat Sox10 homolog has been detected. Here we report that the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor beta4 and alpha3 subunit gene promoters are transactivated by rat Sox10 in a cell type-specific manner. The alpha3 and beta4 subunits, in combination with the alpha5 subunit, make up the predominant nicotinic receptor subtype expressed in the peripheral nervous system. Transfections using Sox10 mutants indicate that the C-terminal region is dispensable for its ability to activate the beta4 and alpha3 promoters. Rat Sox10 was originally identified as an accessory protein of the POU domain protein Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP in glial cells. Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP was shown previously to activate the alpha3 promoter. We now demonstrate that it can transactivate the beta4 promoter as well. However, we were unable to detect any synergistic effects of Sox10 and Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP on beta4 or alpha3 promoter activity. Finally, we present data suggesting that recombinant Sox10 protein can directly interact with a previously characterized regulatory region of the beta4 gene.;-;-;-;hard_0
1177;8614401;Functional comparison of the Mus musculus molossinus and Mus musculus domesticus Sry genes.;The Sry gene functions as a genetic switch initiating testicular development of the indifferent mammalian gonad. The Mus musculus molossinus Sry open reading frame (ORF) encodes a 395-amino acid transcription factor (mSry) that specifically binds and bends DNA through its N-terminal HMG domain and activates transcription through its long C-terminal (residues 144-366) glutamine/histidine-rich activation domain. The M. m. domesticus Sry ORF encodes a highly homologous, truncated protein (dSry) of approximately 230 amino acids, and the molecular basis for truncation is a point mutation that creates an amber stop codon within the activation domain. The mSry protein activates transcription of a Sry-responsive reporter gene in HeLa cells, but dSry does not. Gene swapping and in vitro DNA binding experiments revealed that lack of transcriptional activation by dSry was not the result of polymorphisms within the first 137 amino acids of the protein. Direct analysis of the C-terminal glutamine/histidine-rich domain revealed that dSry lacked a functional transcriptional activation domain. Fusion of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain to the C-terminal deletion mutants of the GAL4-mSry chimeric protein indicated that residues 263-345 of the glutamine/histidine-rich domain were necessary for high level transactivation. Furthermore, readthrough of the premature amber stop codon by transfer RNA suppression resulted in a strong GAL4-dSry transactivator. This demonstrated that the premature stop codon is the only polymorphism responsible for the inability of the dSry glutamine/histidine-rich region to transactivate. ;polyhistidine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

The compounds tested include the DNA intercalating drugs proflavine and ethidium bromide and an amsacrine-4-carboxamide DNA-threading intercalator as well as the AT-specific DNA minor groove binders netropsin, Hoechst 33258, berenil and DAPI. In all cases except for netropsin, negative reduced dichroism signals were measured in the drug absorption band. In agreement with previous studies, the results indicate that both classical and threading intercalation can occur with the TAR RNA. The ELD data show that the mode of binding of the drugs Hoechst 33258, berenil and DAPI to the TAR RNA is similar to their binding mode in GC-rich regions of DNA and likely involves intercalation into the A-form TAR RNA helix. The wide and shallow minor groove of the TAR RNA is apparently not accessible to DNA minor groove binding drugs such as netropsin.

1184;8955148;Products of the grg (Groucho-related gene) family can dimerize through the amino-terminal Q domain.;The murine grg (Groucho-related gene) products are believed to interact with transcription factors and repress transcription, thereby regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. Most proteins in the grg family contain all of the domains found in the Drosophila Groucho protein, including the S/P (Ser-Pro-rich) domain required for interaction with transcription factors and the WD40 domain, which is thought to interact with other proteins. However, at least two Grg proteins contain only the amino-terminal Q (glutamine-rich) domain. We examined whether the Q domain is used for dimerization between Grg proteins, using the yeast two-hybrid system and binding assays with glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. We found that Grg proteins are able to dimerize through the Q domain and that dimerization requires a core of 50 amino acids. Surprisingly, the dimerization does not require the leucine zipper located within the Q domain.;polyglutamine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
1192;9370277;Identification of a functional CT-element in the Phytophthora infestans piypt1 gene promoter.;CT-rich sequences of incompletely characterized function have been found in the gene promoter regions of many organisms, fungi and members of the genus Phytophthora prominently among them. We describe here an in vitro analysis of CT-element function in regulating transcription of the Phytophthora infestans piypt1 gene, a gene that encodes a monomeric G-protein believed to be involved in regulation of vesicle transport (Chen and Roxby (1996) Gene 181, 89-94). The results of the promoter analysis indicate that a 17-bp CT-element lying close to the transcription start point of this gene is important in determining the frequency of transcription initiation. Competition experiments suggest that transcription factors bind to the CT element. A subregion lying at the 5'-end of the CT-element resembles an Inr element, a type of CT-rich transcription regulator first discovered in some mammalian genes. This Inr-like subregion appears to be more important in the interactions leading to transcription initiation than more downstream regions within this CT-element. Two proteins, of 37 and 45 kDa, respectively, that bind to the CT-element and are presumed to be transcription factors were detected in P. infestans nuclear extracts by southwestern blotting. ;polythreonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

The aim of this study was to know the prevalence of the different variants of HCV in the Health Care area of Monforte de Lemos (Lugo, Spain) and its distribution according to risk factors and to compare the results obtained with one genotyping and one serotyping technique.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Eighty-four patients with hepatitis C were studied, 25 of whom were IVDA, 14 had received blood transfusions, 4 hemodialysis and the risk factor was unknown in 41. The antibodies against HCV were studied by second generation EIA and confirmed by an immunoblot technique. Serotyping was carried out by an ELISA test. Genotyping was undertaken with a reverse hybridation test of the amplification obtained by polymerase chain reaction prior to reverse transcription (RT-PCR).


RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The genotypes most frequently observed were 1b (47.6%), 1a (20.2%) and 3 (14.3%). In the IVDA patients the genotypes 1a (40%) and 3 (24%) predominated. The 1b genotype was the most prevalent in the patients of unknown risk (68.3%) and patients with a history of blood transfusion (50%). The prevalence of the different serotypes was similar to that of the corresponding genotypes, with nearly 100% agreement. The number of untypable cases was greater in the serotyping technique (20.2%) than in the genotyping (2.4%). A greater number of mixed infections was detected with serotyping (7 cases, 8.3%) than with genotyping (1 case, 1.2%).

Genomic clones were isolated which together contain the complete chicken HMG-14a gene. The gene covers about 10 kb while coding for an mRNA of about 1000 nt in size. Primer extension, S1 mapping and further cDNA clone analysis suggest that HMG-14a codes for multiple mRNAs arising from two or more transcription start points with alternative splicing and utilization of two or more polyadenylation sites. However, no variation in the coding portion of the mRNA has been observed. The sequence of the promoter region of HMG-14a is similar to that of chicken HMG-14b and human HMG-14 in that it is very G+C rich, contains several putative Sp1-binding sequences and has an unusually high density of CpG dinucleotides. Expression studies confirm earlier results suggesting that the gene is expressed at low levels in most tissue types.;-;-;-;hard_0
1197;8610176;Identification and characterization of a RING zinc finger gene (C-RZF) expressed in chicken embryo cells.;To identify changes in gene expression that occur in chicken embryo brain (CEB) cells as a consequence of their binding to the extracellular matrix molecule cytotactin/tenascin (CT/TN), a subtractive hybridization cloning strategy was employed. One of the cDNA clones identified was predicted to encode 381 amino acids and although it did not resemble any known sequences in the nucleic acid or protein data bases, it did contain the sequence motif for the cysteine-rich C3HC4 type of zinc finger, also known as a RING-finger. This sequence was therefore designated the chicken-RING zinc finger (C-RZF). In addition to the RING-finger, the C-RZF sequence also contained motifs for a leucine zipper, a nuclear localization signal, and a stretch of acidic amino acids similar to the activation domains of some transcription factors. Southern analysis suggested that C-RZF is encoded by a single gene. Northern and in situ hybridization analyses of E8 chicken embryo tissues indicated that expression of the C-RZF gene was restricted primarily to brain and heart. Western analysis of the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of chicken embryo heart cells and immunofluorescent staining of chicken embryo cardiocytes with anti-C-RZF antibodies demonstrated that the C-RZF protein was present in the nucleus. The data suggest that we have identified another member of the RING-finger family of proteins whose expression in CEB cells may be affected by CT/TN and whose nuclear localization and sequence motifs predict a DNA-binding function in the nucleus. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
1200;27309986;Effects of fasting on serial measurements of hyperpolarized [1-(13) C]pyruvate metabolism in tumors.;Imaging of the metabolism of hyperpolarized [1-(13) C]pyruvate has shown considerable promise in preclinical studies in oncology, particularly for the assessment of early treatment response. The repeatability of measurements of (13) C label exchange between pyruvate and lactate was determined in a murine lymphoma model in fasted and non-fasted animals. The fasted state showed lower intra-individual variability, although the [1-(13) C]lactate/[1-(13) C]pyruvate signal ratio was significantly greater in fasted than in non-fasted mice, which may be explained by the higher tumor lactate concentrations in fasted animals. These results indicate that the fasted state may be preferable for the measurement of (13) C label exchange between pyruvate and lactate, as it reduces the variability and therefore should make it easier to detect the effects of therapy. © 2016 The Authors.

1205;35456690;Peptide-Based Vaccine against SARS-CoV-2: Peptide Antigen Discovery and Screening of Adjuvant Systems.;The SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused a global crisis, resulting in 0.5 billion infections and over 6 million deaths as of March 2022. Fortunately, infection and hospitalization rates were curbed due to the rollout of DNA and mRNA vaccines. However, the efficacy of these vaccines significantly drops a few months post immunization, from 88% down to 47% in the case of the Pfizer BNT162 vaccine. The emergence of variant strains, especially delta and omicron, have also significantly reduced vaccine efficacy. We propose peptide vaccines as a potential solution to address the inadequacies of the current vaccines. Peptide vaccines can be easily modified to target emerging strains, have greater stability, and do not require cold-chain storage. We screened five peptide fragments (B1-B5) derived from the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to identify neutralizing B-cell peptide antigens. We then investigated adjuvant systems for efficient stimulation of immune responses against the most promising peptide antigens, including liposomal formulations of polyleucine (L10) and polymethylacrylate (PMA), as well as classical adjuvants (CFA and MF59). Immune efficacy of formulations was evaluated using competitive ELISA, pseudovirion neutralization, and live virus neutralization assays. Unfortunately, peptide conjugation to L10 and PMA dramatically altered the secondary structure, resulting in low antibody neutralization efficacy. Of the peptides tested, only B3 administered with CFA or MF59 was highly immunogenic. Thus, a peptide vaccine relying on B3 may provide an attractive alternative to currently marketed vaccines.;polyleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
1208;9833934;Influence of laser photocoagulation for clinically significant diabetic macular oedema (DMO) on short-wavelength and conventional automated perimetry.;"The aim of the study was to determine the effect of laser photocoagulation for clinically significant diabetic macular oedema (DMO) on macular visual function as assessed by conventional and short-wavelength automated static threshold perimetry. The sample comprised 24 patients who required laser photocoagulation for clinically significant DMO (mean age 59.75 years, range 45-75 years). One eye of each patient was selected for the study. Patients underwent conventional and short-wavelength perimetry using programme 10-2 of the Humphrey Field Analyser on two separate occasions prior to treatment and subsequently within 1 week of, and at 1, 2, 4 and 12 weeks after, treatment. The pointwise pattern deviation plot was analysed for conventional perimetry and a pointwise horizontal and vertical hemifield asymmetry analysis was derived for short-wavelength perimetry (thereby negating the influence of pre-receptoral absorption). The extent of sensitivity loss was determined by counting the number of stimulus locations with statistical probability levels of p less than 0.05. Group mean log minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) visual acuity was largely unchanged over the course of the study. Conventional perimetry showed an increase in the group mean number of abnormal contiguous stimulus locations from 2.4 (SD 4.3, range 0-14) immediately prior to treatment, to 12.4 (SD 7.8, range 0-30) within 1 week of treatment; at 3 months post-treatment, the group mean number of abnormal contiguous stimulus locations was 8.1 (SD 6.5, range 0-20). A similar but less pronounced change was found for short-wavelength perimetry. The spatial position of the post-treatment localised sensitivity loss corresponded with the area of retinal photocoagulation. Despite proven benefit in the stabilisation of visual acuity, laser photocoagulation for clinically significant DMO invariably results in a localised loss of perimetric sensitivity within 10 degrees eccentricity of the fovea. Evidence for the value of laser therapy for clinically significant DMO must be re-examined.";-;-;-;hard_0
1210;16114874;Reconciling observations of sequence-specific conformational propensities with the generic polymeric behavior of denatured proteins.;"Radii of gyration of denatured proteins vary with chain length and are insensitive to details of amino acid sequence. Observations of sequence independence in polymeric properties conflict with results from spectroscopic experiments, which suggest the presence of sequence-specific residual structure in denatured states. Can we reconcile the two apparently conflicting sets of observations? To answer this question, we need knowledge of the ensemble of conformations accessible to proteins in good solvents. The excluded-volume limit provides an ideal mimic of polymers in good solvents. Therefore, we attempt to solve the ""reconciliation problem"" by simulating conformational ensembles accessible to peptides and proteins in the excluded-volume limit. Analysis of these ensembles for a variety of polypeptide sequences leads to results that are consistent with experimental observations of sequence-specific conformational preferences in short peptides and the scaling behavior of polymeric quantities for denatured proteins. Reconciliation in the excluded-volume limit comes about due to a tug of war between two factors, namely, minimization of steric overlap and the competing effects of conformational entropy. Minimization of steric overlap promotes chain stretching and leads to experimentally observed sequence-dependent preferences for locally extended segments such as polyproline II helices, beta-strands, and very short stretches of alpha-helix. Conformational entropy opposes chain stretching, and the calculated persistence length for sequence-dependent conformational preferences is less than five amino acids. This estimate does not vary with amino acid sequence. The short persistence lengths lead directly to experimental observations of generic sequence-independent behavior of radii of gyration for denatured proteins. ";polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function
1212;27142530;Expression of Sp7 in Satb2-induced osteogenic differentiation of mouse bone marrow stromal cells is regulated by microRNA-27a.;Satb2 is a special AT-rich binding transcription factor essential for osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Specific microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified to regulate the complex process of osteogenic differentiation. It remains unclear how miRNA expressions is changed in the Satb2-induced osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). From the miRNA expression profile data collected by us from Satb2-induced osteogenic differentiation of mouse BMSCs, we found that miR-27a was significantly down-regulated relative to non-treated cells 7 days post induction. By in silico analysis, we identified Sp7 as a miR-27a targeting gene and verified the findings by Western blot analysis, qRT-PCR, and luciferase reporter assays. We also analyzed the function of miR-27a in osteogenic differentiation by transfection of exogenous miR-27a into BMSCs. Overexpression of miR-27a remarkably inhibited the expression of Sp7 and attenuated Satb2-induced osteogenic differentiation. Our results suggest that expression of Sp7 during the early stage of Satb2-induced osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs is regulated by miR-27a.  ;polythreonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
1214;33297405;Regulation of Fetal Genes by Transitions among RNA-Binding Proteins during Liver Development.;Transcripts of alpha-fetoprotein (Afp), H19, and insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2) genes are highly expressed in mouse fetal liver, but decrease drastically during maturation. While transcriptional regulation of these genes has been well studied, the post-transcriptional regulation of their developmental decrease is poorly understood. Here, we show that shortening of poly(A) tails and subsequent RNA decay are largely responsible for the postnatal decrease of Afp, H19, and Igf2 transcripts in mouse liver. IGF2 mRNA binding protein 1 (IMP1), which regulates stability and translation efficiency of target mRNAs, binds to these fetal liver transcripts. When IMP1 is exogenously expressed in mouse adult liver, fetal liver transcripts show higher expression and possess longer poly(A) tails, suggesting that IMP1 stabilizes them. IMP1 declines concomitantly with fetal liver transcripts as liver matures. Instead, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that promote RNA decay, such as cold shock domain containing protein E1 (CSDE1), K-homology domain splicing regulatory protein (KSRP), and CUG-BP1 and ETR3-like factors 1 (CELF1), bind to 3' regions of fetal liver transcripts. These data suggest that transitions among RBPs associated with fetal liver transcripts shift regulation from stabilization to decay, leading to a postnatal decrease in those fetal transcripts.;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
1216;2308937;Isolation and characterization of cDNA encoding the 80-kDa subunit protein of the human autoantigen Ku (p70/p80) recognized by autoantibodies from patients with scleroderma-polymyositis overlap syndrome.;"Anti-Ku (p70/p80) autoantibodies in patients with scleroderma-polymyositis overlap syndrome recognize a 70-kDa/80-kDa protein heterodimer which binds to terminal regions of double-stranded DNA. In the present study, we isolated full-length cDNAs that encode the 80-kDa Ku subunit. Initial screening of a human spleen cDNA library with anti-Ku antibodies yielded a cDNA of 1.0 kilobase (kb) (termed K71) encoding a portion of the 80-kDa Ku polypeptide (identification based on immunological criteria). In RNA blots, this cDNA hybridized with two mRNAs of 3.4 and 2.6 kb. In rescreening of a cDNA library constructed from simian virus 40-transformed human fibroblast mRNA with the K71 cDNA as a hybridization probe, three positive clones were isolated, and that bearing the longest insert (termed Ku80-6) was selected for further characterization. In vitro transcription and translation experiments produced an immunoprecipitable polypeptide which comigrated with the 80-kDa Ku subunit. The Ku80-6 cDNA proved to be 3304 nucleotides in length, with an additional poly(A) tail, closely approximating the size of the larger mRNA. It contains a single long open reading frame encoding 732 amino acids (Mr = 82,713). The putative polypeptide has a high content of acidic amino acids and a region with periodic repeat of leucine in every seventh position which may form the ""leucine zipper"" structure. In genomic DNA blots, probes derived from the opposite ends of cDNA Ku80-6 hybridized with several nonoverlapping restriction fragments from human leukocyte DNA, indicating that the gene encoding the 80-kDa Ku polypeptide is divided into several exons by intervening sequences.

1217;5675508;Susceptibility of coagulase-negative staphylococci to lysostaphin and other antibiotics.;In general, coagulase-negative staphylococci were found to be relatively less susceptible to the lytic action of lysostaphin than coagulase-positive staphylococci. To achieve, arbitrarily, a lysis greater than 75%, it was necessary to use an increased concentration of enzyme or a longer incubation period than that usually required with coagulase-positive strains. For the most part, the cultures studied were sensitive to oxacillin, cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, nafcillin, ancillin, cephalothin, cephaloridine, fusidic acid, lincomycin, novobiocin, and neomycin [median minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 1.56 mug/ml or less]. Some degree of resistance (median MIC values of 12.5 mug/ml or greater) to benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, methicillin, tetracycline, chloretetracycline, erythromycin, ristocetin, and lysostaphin was found. Ten methicillin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococal strains were found to be cross-resistant to all nine of the penicillins tested, but much less resistant to the two cephalosporin analogues. In several instances, some of these strains seemed to be more sensitive to benzylpenicillin and to certain of the semisynthetic penicillins than to methicillin. Of the 18 antibiotics tested with the viable plate count method, the methicillin-resistant strains were found to be the most sensitive to lincomycin and novobiocin.;-;-;-;hard_0

Protein Phosphatases 1, 1-18] are the only phosphatases displaying significant activity toward the deinhibitor protein. Among them, the PCSH protein phosphatase represents more than 80% of the measurable deinhibitor phosphatase activity associated with the PCS phosphatases. The deinhibitor phosphatase activity co-purifies with the PCSH phosphatase to apparent homogeneity. In the last purification step two forms of PCSH phosphatase were separated (PCSH1, containing 62, 55 and 34 kDa subunits, and PCSH2, containing 62 and 35 kDa subunits), both showing the same deinhibitor/phosphorylase phosphatase activity ratio. The activity of the PCSH phosphatase toward the deinhibitor is not stimulated by polycations such as protamine, histone H1 or polylysine, unlike the stimulation observed with phosphorylase as the substrate. The phosphorylase phosphatase activity of PCSH phosphatase is inhibited by ATP, PPi and Pi, whereas the deinhibitor phosphatase activity of the enzyme is much less sensitive to these agents.;polylysine;phosphatase activity;-;LCR_with_function
1228;30122033;Differential Conformational Dynamics Encoded by the Linker between Quasi RNA Recognition Motifs of Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein H.;Members of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) F/H family are multipurpose RNA binding proteins that participate in most stages of RNA metabolism. Despite having similar RNA sequence preferences, hnRNP F/H proteins function in overlapping and, in some cases, distinct cellular processes. The domain organization of hnRNP F/H proteins is modular, consisting of N-terminal tandem quasi-RNA recognition motifs (F/HqRRM1,2) and a third C-terminal qRRM3 embedded between glycine-rich repeats. The tandem qRRMs are connected through a 10-residue linker, with several amino acids strictly conserved between hnRNP H and F. A significant difference occurs at position 105 of the linker, where hnRNP H contains a proline and hnRNP F an alanine. To investigate the influence of P105 on the conformational properties of hnRNP H, we probed the structural dynamics of its HqRRM1,2 domain with X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and small-angle X-ray scattering. The collective results best describe that HqRRM1,2 exists in a conformational equilibrium between compact and extended structures. The compact structure displays an electropositive surface formed at the qRRM1-qRRM2 interface. Comparison of NMR relaxation parameters, including Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) relaxation dispersion, between HqRRM1,2 and FqRRM1,2 indicates that FqRRM1,2 primarily adopts a more extended and flexible conformation. Introducing the P105A mutation into HqRRM1,2 alters its conformational dynamics to favor an extended structure. Thus, our work demonstrates that the linker compositions confer different structural properties between hnRNP F/H family members that might contribute to their functional diversity. ;polyglycine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
1232;8347274;Copper and gene regulation in yeast.;The essential trace element copper is also highly toxic when accumulated at high intracellular levels. Copper detoxification in the yeasts S.cerevisiae and C.glabrata is carried out, in large part, by small, cysteine-rich metal binding proteins known as metallothioneins (MTs). The biosynthesis of yeast metallothioneins, the S.cerevisiae copper, zinc superoxide dismutase, and presumably other important copper homeostatic proteins, is transcriptionally induced by elevated environmental copper concentrations through the action of copper metalloregulatory transcription factors (MRTFs). Copper coordination drives the formation of a structure distinct from the apo-protein, whereupon the DNA binding function of MRTFs is activated. The copper MRTFs, ACE1 from S.cerevisiae and AMT1 from C.glabrata, directly interact with specific copper-responsive cis-acting elements in the promotor regions of their respective target genes. The binding of copper, as a polynuclear cluster, to MRTFs provides a sensitive and rapid means of transducing the extracellular metal signal to activate gene transcription. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

Some groups have opted to test new agents in previously untreated patients with extensive-stage SCLC, and the second approach is to continue to test new agents only in previously treated patients.

1238;9164849;Transcriptional activation of human 12-lipoxygenase gene promoter is mediated through Sp1 consensus sites in A431 cells.;The functional 5' flanking region of the human 12-lipoxygenase in epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells was characterized. By a primer extension method, the transcription initiation sites were mapped at -47 adenosine, -48 guanosine and -55 guanosine upstream of the ATG translation start codon. Transient transfection with a series of 5' and 3' deletion constructs showed that the 5' flanking region spanning from -224 to -100 bp was important for the basal expression of 12-lipoxygenase gene. Gel mobility shift assays with antibodies of transcription factors showed that both Sp1 and Sp3 required highly GC-rich Sp1 sites within this region for binding. Disruption of two Sp1 recognition motifs residing at -158 to -150 bp and -123 to -114 bp by site-directed mutagenesis markedly reduced the basal 12-lipoxygenase promoter activity and abolished the retarded bands in a gel-shift assay, indicating that these two Sp1-binding sites were essential for gene expression. The same two Sp1-binding sites in this promoter region were also responsible for epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced expression of 12-lipoxygenase gene. Moreover, EGF also induced the transcriptional activation of luciferase driven by SV40 early promoter, which contained rich Sp1-binding sites. Taken together, the results suggest that two specific Sp1 consensus sites are involved in the mediation of the basal promoter activity as well as EGF induction of the 12-lipoxygenase gene and that Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors might have a role in their regulation.;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
1239;8212571;The CAEV tat gene trans-activates the viral LTR and is necessary for efficient viral replication.;"Caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV) is a lentivirus which is closely related by nucleotide sequence and biological properties to visna virus. Sequence analysis of the CAEV genome revealed the presence of a small open reading frame (ORF) which shares amino acid identity with the visna virus tat gene. Using an infectious molecular clone of CAEV the role of the tat ORF in viral replication was examined. Mutations were made in the tat ORF that introduced two in frame stop codons six amino acids downstream of the tat AUG; in addition, a deletion mutant was made that removed most of the tat ORF. Both of these mutants had greatly reduced virus titers (> 1000-fold less than the wild type infectious clone). Co-transfection of a tat expressing plasmid with these viruses containing the tat ORF mutations resulted in higher levels of virus production demonstrating that the effects of both mutants are tat specific. These mutants provide data that the CAEV tat gene is necessary for efficient virus replication. Analysis of the RNA in these transfected cells showed that complementation of the tat gene was in trans and not the result of recombination. Analysis of the gag and rev proteins in the transfected cells demonstrated that these proteins were not detectable in cells transfected with the tat mutants but could be readily detected when the mutations were complemented in trans with a tat expression vector. To test for tat mediated trans-activation a plasmid expressing the CAEV tat ORF was co-transfected with plasmids containing either the CAEV or visna virus LTR driving transcription of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (CAT). These experiments indicate that one function of the CAEV tat protein is to trans-activate gene expression from the viral promoter. RNase protection analysis of CAT mRNA from co-transfected cells demonstrated that CAEV Tat trans-activates gene expression by increasing steady-state levels of mRNA.";-;-;-;hard_0
1240;9010027;Macrophage-directed immunotherapy as adjuvant to photodynamic therapy of cancer.;The effect of Photofrin-based photodynamic therapy (PDT) and adjuvant treatment with serum vitamin D3-binding protein-derived macrophage-activating factor (DBPMAF) was examined using a mouse SCCVII tumour model (squamous cell carcinoma). The results show that DBPMAF can markedly enhance the curative effect of PDT. The most effective DBPMAF therapy consisted of a combination of intraperitoneal and peritumoral injections (50 and 0.5 ng kg-1 respectively) administered on days 0, 4, 8 and 12 after PDT. Used with a PDT treatment curative to 25% of the treated tumours, this DBPMAF regimen boosted the cures to 100%. The DBPMAF therapy alone showed no notable effect on the growth of SCCVII tumour. The PDT-induced immunosuppression, assessed by the evaluation of delayed-type contact hypersensitivity response in treated mice, was greatly reduced with the combined DBPMAF treatment. These observations suggest that the activation of macrophages in PDT-treated mice by adjuvant immunotherapy has a synergistic effect on tumour cures. As PDT not only reduces tumour burden but also induces inflammation, it is proposed that recruitment of the activated macrophages to the inflamed tumour lesions is the major factor for the complete eradication of tumours.;-;-;-;hard_0

These sequences were further characterized in silico by subjecting them to homology search, multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree construction, and protein functional analysis, revealing their identity to Dof like proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of cloned SbDof genes along with other reported Dof proteins revealed existence of two major groups A and B, while group A was further bifurcated into two sub-groups (viz., I and II). Motif scan analysis of SbDof proteins revealed the presence of glycine- and alanine-rich profiles in SbDof1, while proline-rich profile was observed in SbDof23. Asparagines, methionine, and serine-rich profiles were common in case of both SbDof19 and SbDof24 proteins.

This review provides the physician with a clinical approach to the diagnosis and management of spider bites. It examines the recent literature concerning management of bites causing dermonecrosis, secondary infection, neuromuscular damage, and allergic reactions.


METHODS
Using the key words ""spider bites,"" ""brown recluse spider bites,"" ""necrotic arachnidism,"" ""black widow spider bites,"" ""latrodectism,"" and ""Tegenaria agrestis (Hobo spider),"" the MEDLINE files were researched for articles pertinent to the practicing physician. Texts related to spiders and spider bites were also consulted.


RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
At least 60 species of spiders have been implicated in human bites. Most cause bites of minimal medical importance, requiring little treatment. Some (brown recluse, Hobo spider) cause severe cutaneous and systemic reactions requiring intensive medical management. The black widow bite can cause severe neurologic problems requiring the use of antivenin. Spider bites are frequently difficult to diagnose because the spider is not seen at the time of the suspected bite. Such bites should be labeled arthropod bites, vector unknown.";-;-;-;hard_0
1258;12554779;Egr-1 induction in rat granulosa cells by follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone: combinatorial regulation by transcription factors cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate regulatory element binding protein, serum response factor, sp1, and early growth response factor-1.;Early growth response factor (Egr-1) is an inducible zinc finger transcription factor that binds specific GC-rich enhancer elements and impacts female reproduction. These studies document for the first time that FSH rapidly induces Egr-1 expression in granulosa cells of small growing follicles. This response is transient but is reinitiated in preovulatory follicles exposed to the LH analog, human chorionic gonadotropin. Immunohistochemical analysis also showed gonadotropin induced Egr-1 in theca cells. The Egr-1 gene regulatory region responsive to gonadotropin signaling was localized within -164 bp of the transcription initiation site. Binding of Sp1/Sp3 to a proximal GC-box at -64/-46 bp was enhanced by FSH in immature granulosa cells but reduced after human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation of preovulatory follicles despite constant protein expression. This dynamic regulation of Sp1 binding was dependent on gonadotropin-regulated mechanisms that modulate Sp1/3-DNA binding activity. Serum response factor was active in granulosa cells and bound a consensus CArG-box/serum response element site, whereas two putative cAMP response elements within the -164-bp region bound cAMP regulatory element (CRE) binding protein (CREB) and a second cAMP-inducible protein immunologically related to CREB. Transient transfection analyses using Egr-1 promoter-luciferase constructs and site-specific mutations show that the serum response element, GC-box, and CRE-131 are involved in gonadotropin regulation of Egr-1 expression in granulosa cells. Specific kinase inhibitors of Erk or protein kinase A antagonized this induction while exogenously expressed Egr-1 enhanced reporter expression. These observations indicate that the Egr-1 gene is a target of both FSH and LH action that may mediate molecular programs of proliferation and/or differentiation during follicle growth, ovulation, and luteinization. ;polycysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function

We report new evidence showing that they also manifest deficits in interhemispheric integration of information, probably reflecting a corpus callosum dysfunction. Patients were given a battery of motor, somatosensory, and visual tests that had to be carried out by using either one or both hemispheres. Tasks were chosen such that subjects with Alzheimer's disease performed normally when using intrahemispheric processing. They, however, performed poorly when interhemispheric communication was required. This observation attests to the presence of a disconnection syndrome and suggests that these interhemispheric tasks can serve as diagnostic tools for the early assessment of their dementia.;-;-;-;hard_0

MDM2 also binds to the tumor suppressor pRB, as well as E2F-1. E2F-1 is a transcription factor that regulates S phase entry and has been shown to cause apoptosis in some cell types when overexpressed. To investigate the effect of adenovirus-mediated E2F-1 overexpression, MDM2-overexpressing tumor cell lines were treated by mock infection, infection with an adenoviral vector expressing beta galactosidase, or E2F-1 (Ad5CMV-E2F-1). Western blot analysis confirmed significant overexpression of E2F-1 in Ad5CMV-E2F-1-infected cells. E2F-1 overexpression resulted in marked growth inhibition and rapid loss of cell viability. Ad5CMV-E2F-1 infection resulted in early S phase entry, followed by apoptotic cell death. E2F-1 overexpression was associated with a marked decrease in MDM2 levels and no evidence of increased Bax levels, whereas p53 and Bcl-2 levels remained undetectable. Cleavage of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase and caspase 3/CPP32 implicated activation of the caspase cascade in E2F-1-mediated apoptosis. These results indicate that adenovirus-mediated E2F-1 overexpression in MDM2-overexpressing tumor cells results in decreased MDM2 expression and widespread apoptosis. Because MDM2-overexpressing tumors are often resistant to p53 gene therapy, adenovirus-mediated E2F-1 gene therapy may be a promising alternative strategy. ;polyalanine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

The bisalkylation (cross-linking) reaction appears to be concerted, and no ""second arm"" reaction has been detected. The results of thermal denaturation studies are consistent with general DNA binding, and suggest a preference for GC-rich sites.

1270;6840676;Abnormal matrix recognition by Morris hepatomas correlates with low glucagon binding capacity.;Liver biomatrix contains a group of connective tissue components needed for attachment, survival, and maintenance of liver-specific functions of adult rat hepatocytes in culture. An acidic extract of liver biomatrix that contains a group of glycoproteins can replace intact biomatrix in promoting attachment and survival of hepatocytes. However, except for albumin synthesis, liver-specific functions have not been tested. Acidic extracts of biomatrices prepared from heart, kidney, lung, and spleen (heterologous) contain a similar group of glycoproteins, but differ with respect to liver glycoproteins in their capacity to sustain hepatocyte binding. Normal hepatocytes attach poorly to heterologous glycoprotein extracts, although regenerating and tumoral hepatocytes attach to liver glycoproteins and adhere equally well or with greater efficiency to heterologous glycoprotein extracts. The increased efficiency of hepatocytes to attach to kidney biomatrix-derived glycoproteins showed a linear correlation with the decreased glucagon binding capacity of their isolated plasma membranes. An epithelioid cell-line derived from kidney (MDCK) attached with higher efficiency to kidney than to liver glycoproteins. These results suggest that biomatrices may contain specific glycoproteins needed for attachment and survival of their epithelial cells. This specificity is lost during the proliferative state of regenerating and tumoral hepatocytes and could be important in the general mechanism of tumor dissemination and metastases.;-;-;-;hard_0
1271;8379528;Relationship between p53 expression and other prognostic factors in human breast carcinoma. An immunohistochemical study.;Among 843 cases of breast cancer, p53 oncoprotein was detected by the monoclonal antibody (MoAb) Pab-1801 in only 13%. Low-grade carcinomas (tubular, mucinous, papillary, and invasive cribriform types) did not express p53 protein, but it was observed in 4.2% of infiltrating lobular carcinomas (6 of 140 cases) and 50% of pure medullary carcinomas (5 of 10 cases). In intermediate-grade neoplasms, no correlation was seen between p53 status and other putative determinants of a poor prognosis. The latter included high tumor stage, lymph nodal involvement, high growth fraction (as determined by labeling with the MoAb Ki-67), negative results for estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) proteins, and amplification of the c-erbB-2 oncogene product in the neoplastic cells. Ninety-nine of 640 (15.5%) cases of high-grade, invasive, ductal breast carcinoma, however, showed an inverse relationship between expression of p53 protein and positive results for ER/PR proteins and a direct correlation with large tumor size, Ki-67-determined growth fraction, and amplification of c-erbB-2 oncopeptide. All of the latter associations were highly significant statistically. The authors conclude that mutant p53 protein may serve a prognostic role in a subset of cases of invasive ductal mammary carcinoma.;-;-;-;hard_0
1274;8014405;Controlling resurgent tuberculosis: public health agencies, public policy, and law.;The reappearance of tuberculosis as a serious public health threat points up the fallacy of the widely held assumption that medical science had conquered the communicable diseases that were once leading causes of morbidity and mortality. In devising a strategy to prevent the spread of TB, public policymakers must adapt traditional TB control measures to reflect the current problem. Such a strategy can and should include the appropriate use of governmental coercion to compel observance of public health TB control measures. Public health approaches to control of human immunodeficiency virus, with their emphasis on the voluntary cooperation of those infected and at high risk for infection, are not a model for effective TB control. Additional resources, while needed, will not alone enable public health agencies to bring TB and other communicable diseases under control. In the present debate over health care reform, little attention has been paid to the importance of public health agencies in protecting the public health. The resurgence of TB is a warning of the consequences of neglecting public health agencies and ignoring the socioeconomic problems that underlie it and other communicable diseases.;-;-;-;hard_0

1286;14977961;Epitope mapping of a protective monoclonal antibody against Pneumocystis carinii with shared reactivity to Streptococcus pneumoniae surface antigen PspA.;Pneumocystis carinii is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes pneumonia in the immunocompromised host. A protective monoclonal antibody (MAb) termed 4F11 generated against mouse-derived P. carinii was shown by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) to bind surface antigens of P. carinii derived from multiple host species, including humans. We have identified multiple epitopes recognized by MAb 4F11 in two recombinant mouse P. carinii antigens. The epitopes mapped have similar proline content and positive charge distribution. The consensus 8-mer epitope recognized by MAb 4F11 is K/RPA/RPK/QPA/TP. Immune sera raised against intact mouse P. carinii recognized native antigens affinity purified with MAb 4F11 and a recombinant antigen reactive with MAb 4F11. Database searches for short, nearly exact matches to the mapped MAb 4F11 epitopes identified a bacterial surface antigen, Streptococcus pneumoniae PspA, with a similar proline-rich region. In an IFA, MAb 4F11 detected antigens on the S. pneumoniae surface, and Western blotting identified a protein in S. pneumoniae lysates consistent with the M(r) of PspA. A fragment of the S. pneumoniae PspA gene was cloned and sequenced, and the deduced amino acid sequence contained a region with strong similarity to the MAb 4F11 epitopes identified in P. carinii. The PspA recombinant polypeptide was recognized by MAb 4F11 in a Western blot. The ability of MAb 4F11 to recognize similar proline-rich epitopes may explain its ability to recognize P. carinii derived from multiple hosts and will permit testing of the epitopes recognized by this antibody in immunization against P. carinii. ;polyproline;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

1297;9016889;Treatment of lupus nephritis: a meta-analysis of clinical trials.;The best therapeutic choice in lupus nephritis remains shrouded in a body of controversial literature. The purpose of this review was to assess and compare by meta-analysis the efficacy of therapeutic agents used in the treatment of lupus nephritis using outcomes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and total mortality. An exhaustive search was performed using MEDLINE (1970 to 1995) and manual search of bibliographic notations and nonindexed sources. Twenty prospective controlled trials with treatment allocation by random assignment or consecutive enrollment were identified using diagnostic evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus based on American Rheumatism Association (ARA) criteria and clinical/biopsy evidence of lupus nephritis. One trial was excluded, resulting in 19 trials (n = 440) using treatment groups of oral prednisone alone, azathioprine with and without concomitant prednisone, oral cyclophosphamide with prednisone, azathioprine and oral cyclophosphamide with prednisone, and intravenous cyclophosphamide with prednisone. Crude risk data was pooled. An adjusted pooled risk was calculated using the random effects model of DerSimonian and Laird. Two measures of clinical effectiveness were used to compare treatments: absolute risk differences and number needed to treat. Analysis was completed between treatment groups as follows: oral prednisone compared with all immunosuppressive agents with prednisone and all treatment groups compared with one another. When compared with oral prednisone alone, immunosuppressive agents used in conjunction with oral prednisone were found to be statistically more effective for both total mortality and ESRD (absolute risk differences, 13.2% and 12.9%, respectively). When treatment groups were compared, intravenous cyclophosphamide in conjunction with oral prednisone was found to be statistically more effective than oral prednisone alone for both total mortality and ESRD (absolute risk differences, 19.9% and 16.2%, respectively). The simultaneous use of azathioprine and oral cyclophosphamide concomitant with oral prednisone was found to be 16.9% more effective than oral prednisone alone in reducing incidence of ESRD. No difference was seen in total mortality and data represented only two studies (n = 30). No immunosuppressive agent was found to be statistically more effective than another for either total mortality or ESRD.

1300;9786935;Biglycan gene expression in the human leiomyosarcoma cell line SK-UT-1. Basal and protein kinase A-induced transcription involves binding of Sp1-like/Sp3 proteins in the proximal promoter region.;In this study we demonstrate that the gene encoding the small leucine-rich proteoglycan biglycan is expressed in human myometrial tissue and in the human leiomyosarcoma cell line SK-UT-1. Treatment of SK-UT-1 cells with forskolin or 8-bromo-cAMP strongly increased biglycan mRNA and this effect was transcriptional as shown by transient transfection experiments with biglycan promoter-luciferase reporter fusion genes. The cAMP-mediated induction of the transfected biglycan promoter in SK-UT-1 cells was abolished by coexpression of a specific protein kinase A inhibitor, and was mimicked by overexpression of the catalytic subunit (Cbeta) of protein kinase A. By 5' deletion analysis, part of the cAMP response was localized to the segment from residues -78 to -46 of the biglycan promoter. This region conferred strong cAMP responsiveness to a heterologous promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift and antibody supershift assays identified two specific complexes that contained nuclear proteins antigenically related to the ubiquitous transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3, respectively. The binding site of these proteins was mapped to a CT-rich sequence extending from -59 to -49 in the biglycan promoter. Mutating this sequence eliminated complex formation and markedly reduced basal and cAMP-dependent promoter activity of transfected reporter genes. In vitro binding studies using recombinant Sp1 revealed that the nuclear factor binding to the CT element was not Sp1 but a Sp1-like protein(s). Western blot analysis of SK-UT-1 nuclear proteins confirmed expression of Sp3, Sp1 and nuclear proteins that crossreacted with Sp1 antibody but according to their molecular weight were not Sp1. These results indicate that all cAMP-dependent as well as some basal biglycan transcription in SK-UT-1 cells is mediated through activated protein kinase A and that both functions are conferred at the promoter level through the interaction of Sp1-like/Sp3 factors with the CT element at -59 in the biglycan promoter.;polythreonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
1301;6372034;Prophylaxis for intraabdominal surgery.;"Great progress has been made in the last decade concerning the appropriate use of antibiotic prophylaxis in the patient undergoing abdominal surgery. Well-controlled, prospective, blind studies have outlined many of the areas in which antibiotic prophylaxis is of benefit as well as those clinical settings in which the risks of antibiotic prophylaxis outweigh the expected value. Historically, the most common errors in usage included the widespread use of antibiotic prophylaxis in clean surgical procedures as well as the faulty timing of initial administration. Currently, the most common error is the practice of continuing the administration of the antibiotic agents beyond the time necessary for maximal benefit (greater than 72 hr). In order to administer prophylactic antibiotics appropriately in the various clinical settings on the surgical service in which this practice has been of proven value, one must be aware of the following nuances: (1) the choice of the antibiotic agent should be based on the type of organisms usually causing infection; (2) the route of administration must be appropriate; (3) the dosage necessary to attain efficacious levels of antibiotic in tissue or serum must be appropriate; and (4) the timing of administration should offer the maximal benefits without risk of the adverse effects.";-;-;-;hard_0
1303;21378162;Musashi1 cooperates in abnormal cell lineage protein 28 (Lin28)-mediated let-7 family microRNA biogenesis in early neural differentiation.;Musashi1 (Msi1) is an RNA-binding protein that is highly expressed in neural stem/progenitor cells (NS/PCs) as well as in other tissue stem cells. Msi1 binds to the 3'-UTR of its target mRNAs in NS/PCs, prevents their translation, and interferes with NS/PC differentiation. We previously showed that Msi1 competes with eIF4G to bind poly(A)-binding protein and inhibits assembly of the 80 S ribosome. Here we show that Msi1 works in concert with Lin28 to regulate post-transcriptional microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis in the cropping step, which occurs in the nucleus. Lin28 and its binding partner terminal uridylyltransferase 4 (TUT4) are known to maintain embryonic stem cell pluripotency by blocking let-7 miRNA biogenesis at the dicing step. Interestingly, we found that during early neural differentiation of embryonic stem cells, Msi1 enhanced the localization of Lin28 to the nucleus and also inhibited the nuclear cropping step of another let-7 family miRNA, miR98. These results suggest that Msi1 can influence stem cell maintenance and differentiation by controlling the subcellular localization of proteins involved in miRNA biogenesis, as well as by regulating the translation of its target mRNA. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
1306;8450530;Zinc finger mutations that alter domain interactions in the glucocorticoid receptor.;The DNA binding domain of steroid receptors coincides with the cysteine-rich region encompassing the two conserved zinc fingers. In the case of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a weak transactivation function has been described to be adjacent or partly overlapping to the DNA binding domain, whereas stronger trans-acting functions are encoded by the amino and the carboxy domain. In this report we describe the phenotype produced by stochastic mutations of the zinc finger region. The mutants were obtained either by selected rearrangements of the rat GR cDNA, or by semi-random nucleotide substitutions. All the identified permissive rearrangements were confined to a region downstream from the first zinc finger (duplications starting between residue 474 and 492). In general, the phenotype of point mutations is compatible with established structural data. Nevertheless, we found two unexpected phenotypes. First, we noticed that the double mutant His451 Asn/Ser459Gly is stronger than the wild-type sequence in DNA binding. Secondly, substitution of the conserved Lys461 results in an abnormal behavior of the mutated GR. In particular, the mutant Lys461Tyr (61Y) displays about the same transactivation when tested in form of a minimal GR fragment (amino acids 407/556) as when tested in the amino-prolongued GR fragment (amino acids 3-556, which contains the major transactivation domain of the GR). This is in contrast with the behavior of the other mutants in which the residue 461 is intact. In these cases, transactivation capacity is normally increased more than 30-fold from GR407-556 to GR3-556. These results are discussed in terms of possible cross-talk among the DNA binding domain and other functions residing in the amino domain of the GR. ;polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
1308;9619513;The intrinsic curvature of a 51 bp K-DNA fragment of Leishmania tarentolae: a molecular model.;DNA intrinsic structure and curvature is a subject of debate because of the importance of these attributes in processes such as DNA packaging, transcription, and gene regulation. X-ray crystallography of DNA single crystals has provided a wealth of information about the local, short range conformational features of DNA. On the other hand, gel electrophoresis analysis of DNA has not only uncovered the macroscopic curvature of DNA but it also provides most of the available data on DNA intrinsic curvature. However, gel electrophoresis can not identify features of DNA structure at the nucleotide or atomic level. In order to address the problem of DNA intrinsic curvature in an attempt to bridge the gap between X-ray crystallography and gel electrophoresis, we use the computational method of molecular dynamics (MD). In this study, we report the results of 2.0 ns MD simulations on a 51 bp fragment of the K-DNA of Leishmania tarentolae containing several A-tracts. The K-DNA double helix is very stable and remains in an intermediate state between the canonical A and B forms of the duplex. The magnitude of global curvature (75 degrees) agrees well with the experimental estimate (72 degrees) available. Analysis of local (every base triplet) and sublocal (every helix turn) curvature shows that the 51 bp K-DNA fragment has curvature features also present in the Wedge, Junction and Calladine's models of DNA intrinsic curvature. We further characterize the flexibility of individual nucleotides in the molecule and find the sugar flexibility within the A-tracts to be strongly correlated with the pattern of A-tract cleavage by the hydroxyl radical. Differential curvature and flexibility at the 5' and 3'junctions between A-tracts and general-sequence DNA are found to modulate the global curvature of the K-DNA fragment.; polyalanine ;helix;-;LCR_with_function

1310;1262342;Function and structure in ribonucleic acid phage Qbeta ribonucleic acid replicase. Effect of inhibitors of EF-Tu on ribonucleic acid synthesis and renaturation of active enzyme.;Escherichia coli Phage Qbeta RNA replicase, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is a tetramer composed of one phage-coded polypeptide and three host-supplied polypeptides which are known to function in the biosynthesis of proteins in the uninfected host. Two of these polypeptides, protein synthesis elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-Ts, are required for initiation of transcription by Qbeta replicase with all templates. Using a previously developed reconstitution system we have examined the effects of modification of EF-Tu on reconstituted replicase activity. The poly(G) polymerase activity of the enzyme can be recovered after pretreatment of the EF-Tu-GDP with either L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone or N-ethylmaleimide, both of which inhibit the aminoacyl-tRNA binding activity of EF-Tu. This suggests that the aminoacyl-tRNA binding site of EF-Tu is not required for Qbeta replicase activity. When Qbeta replicase is treated with kirromycin, an antibiotic which modifies EF-Tu activity by an unknown mechamism, the protein synthetic activity of the EF-Tu in the replicase complex is eliminated but the Qbeta RNA replication activity is only slightly affected. Treatment of pure EF-Tu with kirromycin, however, prevents it from functioning in the renaturation of Qbeta replicase. This antibiotic is not effective against the EF-Tu-Ts complex in the reconstitution assay. Kirromycin at the relatively high concentration used here is found to prevent the formation of the EF-Tu-Ts complex. GDP, which binds to EF-Tu and inhibits formation of the complex with EF-Ts, also inhibits renaturation of Qbeta replicase. It is suggested that the EF-Tu-Ts complex, rather than the individual polypeptides, functions in the renaturation of Qbeta replicase and that the kirromycin and GDP act by preventing formation of this complex. ;polyglycine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

By the end of 2003 there were 900 000 adults and children in Malawi living with HIV/AIDS. Adult prevalence was estimated to be 15%, which is higher than the 7.1% average rate for sub-Saharan Africa. In order to understand the spread of HIV/AIDS it is imperative to address the economic, social, cultural, and political issues that impact on women's contraction and spread of the virus. We do so in this paper by critically examining the gendered context of HIV/AIDS with reference to Malawi. The theoretical framework for this research focuses on poverty, gender relations, regional migration patterns, and global economic changes which place women in highly vulnerable situations. The study was conducted in a low-income area in Lilongwe, the capital city of Malawi. In 2003 and 2004, 60 randomly selected women who lived in a low socioeconomic residential area completed a structured interview on issues concerning individual economic situations, marriage history, fertility, family planning and social networks, gender, sexual partnerships, and HIV/AIDS. Focus group interviews were also conducted with an additional 20 women. The results of our study indicate that the rising epidemic among women in Malawi is firstly driven by poverty which limits their options. Secondly, gender inequality and asymmetrical sexual relations are basic to spreading HIV/AIDS among women. Thirdly, in spite of their awareness through media and health care professionals, women are unable to protect themselves, which further increases their vulnerability.;-;-;-;hard_0

(1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 2750-2753). A tyrosine kinase phosphorylating the band 3 protein in situ has been extracted from ghosts by non-ionic detergent and partially characterized (Phan-Dinh-Tuy, F., Henry, J. and Kahn, A.

We have studied the properties of the tyrosine kinase activity which remains bound to the ghosts after detergent extraction using the 43 kDa fragment of protein 3 as substrate. This activity, solubilized from the detergent-resistant material at 0.25 M NaCl and concentrated by phosphocellulose and tyrosine-agarose chromatographies, remains linked to high molecular weight complexes. It is specific for tyrosine. Assayed with the purified 43 kDa fragment it requires the presence of Mn2+ which cannot be replaced by Mg2+. Its affinity for 43 kDa fragment is very high with a Km of 3.3 microM. ATP acts as a phosphoryl donor with a Km of 0.55 microM. The tyrosine kinase activity was not modified by insulin, DMSO, phorbol ester and epidermal growth factor, vanadate and xanthine derivatives. Polyamines spermidine and the polylysine are inhibitors in the presence of Mn2+ but not in the presence of Mg2+. Heparin is a competitive inhibitor of ATP. 2,3-Diphosphoglycerate is an inhibitor at physiological concentrations (Ki = 2 mM). Purified red cell actin is not phosphorylated by the tyrosine kinase.

Using macrophage-specific Slc39a10-knockout (Slc39a10;LysM-Cre ) mice, we found that Slc39a10 plays an essential role in macrophage survival by mediating Zn homeostasis in response to LPS stimulation.

The deduced sequence of lrp130 exhibits sequences weakly homologous to the consensus sequence for the ATP binding site in ATP-dependent kinases and the protein kinase C phosphorylation site of the epidermal growth factor receptor. Consistent with the higher levels of expression of lrp130 antigen, Northern hybridization analysis indicated that HepG2 cells express high levels of the major 4.8 kilobase lrp130 mRNA relative to other hepatoma cells.

The study is a prospective comparison of helical CT with nonhelical CT arterial portography (CTAP) in the detection of liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma, using surgical and histologic findings as the gold standard.


SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Thirty-five patients with colorectal carcinoma and suspected liver metastases were prospectively examined with helical CT and CTAP before surgery. In nine cases, surgery was not performed. In the remaining 26 patients, imaging results were correlated with surgical and pathologic findings. Three radiologists prospectively assessed metastatic involvement with both techniques. The results were compared with pathologic and surgical findings on a lesion-by-lesion basis. In a second phase, three radiologists not directly concerned in the design of the study independently assessed metastatic involvement of the liver as revealed on helical CT and CTAP on a segment-by-segment basis with a five-level scale of confidence. Results were analyzed by receiver operating characteristic methods.


RESULTS
The results of the histologic study disclosed 50 metastatic lesions. Helical CT had a sensitivity of 76% (38/50) and a positive predictive value of 90%. CTAP had a sensitivity of 74% (37/50) and positive predictive value of 69%. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed a greater area under the curve (Az index), 0.96, for helical CT than for CTAP (0.86). Differences were statistically significant (p < .001).

Helical CT is superior to nonhelical CTAP in the detection of hepatic metastases from colorectal carcinoma.";-;-;-;hard_0
1331;8897602;Cation selective promotion of tubulin polymerization by alkali metal chlorides.;A role for charge-based interactions in protein stability at the monomer or dimer level is well known. We show here that such interactions can also be important for the higher-order structures of microtubule assembly. Alkali metal chlorides increase the rate of polymerization of pure tubulin driven by either taxol or dimethyl sulfoxide. The effect is cation selective, exhibiting a sequence Na+ > K+ > Li+ > Cs+, with optimal concentrations for Na+ at approximately 160 mM. Hofmeister anion effects are additive with these rate stimulations. Sodium is less potent than guanidinium ion stimulation reported previously, but produces a larger fraction of normal microtubules. Alkali metal cations lower the critical concentration by a factor of approximately 2, produce cold reversible polymers whose formation is sensitive to podophyllotoxin inhibition, increase the fraction of polymers present as microtubules from approximately 0.9 to 0.99, and reverse or prevent urea-induced depolymerization of microtubules. In the presence of microtubule-associated proteins, the promotion of polymerization is no longer cation selective. In the polymerization of tubulin S, in which the acidic C termini of both monomers have been cleaved, the cation enhancement is markedly decreased, although selective persists. Because the selectivity sequence is similar to that of the coil/helix transition of polyglutamic acid, we suggest that a major part, although not all, of the cation selective enhancement of polymerization results from shielding of the glutamate-rich C termini of the tubulin monomers. ;polyglutamic;helix;-;LCR_with_function
1337;11029879;EGF receptor activation of the human gastrin gene: a tale of two zinc finger transcription factor families.;Gastrin is one of the oldest and most actively studied of the gastrointestinal peptides. Adult expression of the mature peptide is restricted to the stomach and duodenum. However, it is antral gastrin that is subject to feedback regulation from the counter-regulatory peptide somatostatin as a function of gastric pH. Yet little is known about the molecular steps required to modulate the synthesis of this peptide. Using cell culture models, a GC-rich regulatory element called gERE has been identified that binds two families of zinc finger transcription factors--Sp and ZBP. Competitive binding of these two transcription factor families in association with changes in their phosphorylation state appears to mediate the positive and negative activation of this gene in response to EGF receptor ligands. These findings contribute to our understanding of gastrin gene expression in the presence of the activated ras oncogene, e.g., during colonic transformation. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
1342;6310297;Direct modulation of epidermal growth factor binding by cholecystokinin.;The effects of cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK8), the biologically active C-terminal moiety of cholecystokinin (CCK), on the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) were studied in isolated rat pancreatic acini. CCK8 inhibited 125I-EGF binding in a dose-dependent manner. One-half maximal inhibition occurred at 5 X 10(-10)M, and maximal inhibition at 10(-8)M CCK8. This inhibitory effect was detectable within 5 minutes of addition of CCK8, and was not associated with enhanced degradation of 125I-EGF in incubation media. Unlabeled EGF exerted only a slightly greater inhibitory effect than CCK8 on 125I-EGF binding at equivalent molar concentrations. In contrast to CCK8, the gastrointestinal hormone vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) did not significantly alter EGF binding. CCK8 also inhibited EGF binding in mouse pancreatic acini, but did not alter binding in A-431 human carcinoma cells. These findings suggest that physiological levels of CCK may regulate EGF binding in the pancreas and other tissues with receptors for both hormones. They thus point to a previously unrecognized mechanism for hormonal interaction.;-;-;-;hard_0
1344;34869581;An Unbound Proline-Rich Signaling Peptide Frequently Samples Cis Conformations in Gaussian Accelerated Molecular Dynamics Simulations.;Disordered proline-rich motifs are common across the proteomes of many species and are often involved in protein-protein interactions. Proline is a unique amino acid due to the covalent bond between the backbone nitrogen and the proline side chain. The resulting five-membered ring allows proline to sample the cis state about its peptide bond, which other residues cannot do as readily. Because proline-rich disordered sequences exist as ensembles that likely include structures with the proline peptide bond in cis, a robust methodology to accurately account for these conformations in the overall ensemble is crucial. Observing the cis conformations of proline in a disordered sequence is challenging both experimentally and computationally. Nitrogen-hydrogen NMR spectroscopy cannot directly observe proline residues, which lack an amide bond, and computational methods struggle to overcome the large kinetic barrier between the cis and trans states, since isomerization usually occurs on the order of seconds. In the current work, Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics was used to overcome this free energy barrier and simulate proline isomerization in a tetrapeptide (KPTP) and in the 12-residue proline-rich SH3 binding peptide, ArkA. We found that Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics, when combined with a lowered peptide bond dihedral angle potential energy barrier (15 kcal/mol), allowed sufficient sampling of the proline cis and trans states on a microsecond timescale. All ArkA prolines spend a significant fraction of time in cis, leading to a more compact ensemble with less polyproline II helix structure than an ArkA ensemble with all peptide bonds in trans. The ensemble containing cis prolines also matches more closely to in vitro circular dichroism data than the all-trans ensemble. The ability of the ArkA prolines to isomerize likely affects the peptide's ability to bind its partner SH3 domain, and should be studied further. This is the first molecular dynamics simulation study of proline isomerization in a biologically relevant proline-rich sequence that we know of, and a similar protocol could be applied to study multi-proline isomerization in other proline-containing proteins to improve conformational diversity and agreement with in vitro data.;polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function
1348;8162461;A clinical, serological and neurophysiological study of restless legs syndrome in rheumatoid arthritis.;The restless legs syndrome (RLS), defined by Gibb and Lees criteria, was investigated in patients with RA. RLS symptoms were more frequent in RA patients (25%) than in non-RA controls with OA or seronegative arthropathy (4%). RLS was significantly more common in females. Judged by a variety of clinical and laboratory indices, RA disease severity and current disease activity were greater in patients with RLS than in RA patients unaffected by RLS. In five out of 14 RLS patients undergoing neurophysiological study, delays in the P40 component of posterior tibial somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) were observed suggesting the existence of myelopathy, whilst in another four RLS patients evidence of peripheral neuropathy was found. Though the higher frequency of neurophysiological abnormalities in RA patients with RLS was not statistically significant, possibly because of the small numbers of patients studied, these data suggest that RLS symptoms in RA may reflect the presence of neurological disorder.;-;-;-;hard_0
1352;20509624;Conjugation to nickel-chelating nanolipoprotein particles increases the potency and efficacy of subunit vaccines to prevent West Nile encephalitis.;Subunit antigens are attractive candidates for vaccine development, as they are safe, cost-effective, and rapidly produced. Nevertheless, subunit antigens often need to be adjuvanted and/or formulated to produce products with acceptable potency and efficacy. Here, we describe a simple method for improving the potency and efficacy of a recombinant subunit antigen by its immobilization on nickel-chelating nanolipoprotein particles (NiNLPs). NiNLPs are membrane mimetic nanoparticles that provide a delivery and presentation platform amenable to binding any recombinant subunit immunogens featuring a polyhistidine tag. A His-tagged, soluble truncated form of the West Nile virus (WNV) envelope protein (trE-His) was immobilized on NiNLPs. Single inoculations of the NiNLP-trE-His produced superior anti-WNV immune responses and provided significantly improved protection against a live WNV challenge compared to mice inoculated with trE-His alone. These results have broad implications in vaccine development and optimization, as NiNLP technology is well-suited to many types of vaccines, providing a universal platform for enhancing the potency and efficacy of recombinant subunit immunogens. ;polyhistidine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
1357;9407088;Ionizing radiation-inducible apoptosis in the absence of p53 linked to transcription factor EGR-1.;The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a pivotal regulator of apoptosis, and prostate cancer cells that lack p53 protein are moderately resistant to apoptotic death by ionizing radiation. Genes encoding the transcription factor early growth response-1 (EGR-1) and cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were induced upon irradiation of prostate cancer cells, and inhibition of EGR-1 function resulted in abrogation of both TNF-alpha induction and apoptosis. Induction of the TNF-alpha gene by ionizing radiation and EGR-1 was mediated via a GC-rich EGR-1-binding motif in the TNF-alpha promoter. Because TNF-alpha induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cells, these findings suggest that, in the absence of p53, ionizing radiation-inducible apoptosis is mediated by EGR-1 via TNF-alpha transactivation.;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

Among these strains were Rhizobium sp. (Ononis) and Rhizobium (Genista), producing hydroxamates and phenolates. These compounds could promote the growth of siderophore-negative bacteria on iron-deficient media.

The approach employs the P-Curves algorithm [H. Sklenar, C. Etchebest, and R. Lavery, (1989) Proteins: Structure, Function and Genetics, Vol. 6, pp. 46-60] to determine the helical axis and a set of helicoidal parameters describing the axis curvature and the position of the repeating units with respect to the axis and each other. The vibrations are analyzed in terms of time correlation functions of the fluctuations of P-Curves parameters and their Fourier transforms. Simulations of polyalanine and myoglobin are analyzed. For polyalanine, global twisting, bending, and stretching vibrations are found at 11, 20, and 40 cm-1, respectively. In myoglobin, the spectra of the global helix vibrations are qualitatively different from those of polyalanine and considerably more complicated. Local vibrations of individual amino acid units in the helix backbones are also analyzed with P-Curves and compared.; polyalanine ;helix;-;LCR_with_function
1365;35717763;A C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor, MdZAT17, acts as a positive regulator in response to salt stress.;Salt stress restricts plant growth and productivity worldwide. Zinc finger proteins play important roles in response to various abiotic plant stresses. In this research, we identified and characterized the ZAT17 gene in Malus domestica, which encodes a C2H2-type zinc finger protein. MdZAT17 has two typical conserved zinc finger domains and an ERF-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif. Promoter analysis showed that MdZAT17 contains several stress-related response elements (ABRE, CGTCA-motif, and TC-rich repeats), and qRT-PCR analysis showed that the expression level of MdZAT17 was induced by various abiotic stress treatments. The overexpression of MdZAT17 improved tolerance to salt stress in apple calli. The ectopic expression of MdZAT17 in Arabidopsis enhanced salt stress tolerance and led to lower malondialdehyde (MDA) content, lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and greater anthocyanin accumulation under salt stress. Moreover, the overexpression of MdZAT17 transgenic apple calli and Arabidopsis reduced the sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA). In conclusion, our results indicate that MdZAT17 plays a positive regulatory role in salt tolerance, providing a theoretical basis for further research on its molecular mechanisms.;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
1371;23500490;The C-terminal region of cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein is a ZZ domain with potential for protein-protein interactions.;Cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein (CPEB) provides temporal and spatial control of protein synthesis required for early development and neuronal synaptic plasticity. CPEB regulates protein expression by inhibiting polyadenylation of selected mRNA transcripts, which prevents binding of the ribosome for protein synthesis. Two RNA recognition motif domains and a C-terminal binuclear zinc-binding domain are required for mRNA binding, but the zinc-binding domain is not required for sequence-specific recognition of the targeted mRNA transcript. The structure and function of the zinc-binding domain of CPEB are unknown. The C-terminal region of CPEB may participate in assembly of the ribonucleoprotein complex that includes the scaffold protein, Symplekin, and the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor. Sumoylation of Symplekin is required for polyadenylation, and both cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor and poly(A) polymerase are sumoylated. The foreshortened poly(A) tail is maintained by poly(A) ribonuclease, which associates with CPEB. While zinc-binding domains are renowned for nucleic acid recognition, binuclear zinc-binding structural motifs, such as LIM (Lin-11, Isl-1, Mec-3), RING (really interesting new gene), PHD (plant homeodomain) and ZZ (ZZ-type zinc finger) domains, participate in protein-protein interactions. Here, we report the solution structure of the C-terminal zinc-binding domain of CPEB1 (CPEB1-ZZ), which has a cross-braced zinc binding topology. The structural similarity to other ZZ domains suggests that the CPEB1-ZZ domain recruits sumoylated proteins during assembly of the ribonucleoprotein complex prior to mRNA export from the nucleus. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
1372;1883515;Regulation of cytokine and viral gene expression in monocytes infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.;Monocytes treated with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) at virus challenge show no evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection: no p24 antigen or reverse transcriptase (RT) activity, no viral mRNA and no proviral DNA. Levels of p24 antigen and RT activity in monocytes infected with HIV 1-3 weeks before IFN-alpha treatment gradually decrease to baseline. HIV-induced cytopathic changes are markedly reduced, as are levels of HIV mRNA: the frequency of productively infected cells is less than or equal to 1%. But, levels of proviral DNA in the IFN-alpha-treated and control HIV-infected cells are indistinguishable, and remain so through 3 weeks. Large quantities of proviral DNA in IFN-alpha-treated cells with little active transcription suggest true microbiological latency. The major potential source for IFN-alpha in HIV-infected patients is the macrophage. With any of 15 virus isolates, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, IFN-omega or IFN-beta are not detected nor the mRNA expressed in HIV-infected or uninfected monocytes. Both uninfected and HIV-infected monocytes produce high levels of these cytokines after treatment with synthetic double-stranded RNA (poly-I:C). Uninfected monocytes also produce high levels of IFN-alpha after treatment with Poly-I:C, Newcastle disease virus or herpes simplex virus. In marked contrast, HIV-infected monocytes express no IFN-alpha activity or mRNA before or after treatment with any of these agents. The markedly diminished capacity of HIV-infected monocyte to produce IFN-alpha reflects a specific transcriptional block and may be an adaptive mechanism of virus to alter basic microbicidal functions of this cell.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS);polyisoleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

It shares 94.6% and 95.4% identity with RDV of Japanese H isolate in terms of nucleotide and amino acid sequences, respectively, and it also shows some homology with VP2 of rotavirus at the level of amino acid sequence. The search of deduced RDV S2 amino acid sequence in Blast network found that there were 4 leucine-rich motifs in P2 protein, and ten amino acids within the hydrophibic region at amino-terminus could form an alpha-helix. Predicted secondary structure of S2 cDNA indicated that a hairpin and a stem loop are present in the 5'-end within 50 bp, and a stem loop in the 3'-end within 50 bp.

We have isolated a novel gene from this region, AIRE (autoimmune regulator), which encodes a protein containing motifs suggestive of a transcription factor including two zinc-finger (PHD-finger) motifs, a proline-rich region and three LXXLL motifs. Two mutations, a C-->T substitution that changes the Arg 257 (CGA) to a stop codon (TGA) and an A-->G substitution that changes the Lys 83 (AAG) to a Glu codon (GAG), were found in this novel gene in Swiss and Finnish APECED patients. The Arg257stop (R257X) is the predominant mutation in Finnish APECED patients, accounting for 10/12 alleles studied. These results indicate that this gene is responsible for the pathogenesis of APECED. The identification of the gene defective in APECED should facilitate the genetic diagnosis and potential treatment of the disease and further enhance our general understanding of the mechanisms underlying autoimmune diseases.;polyproline;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function

[14C]temoporfin was administered intravenously (0.73 mumol/kg) to tumor-free mice or to mice implanted with the Colo 26 colorectal carcinoma. Blood, tissue and fecal samples were collected for 35 days and 10 days postdose from tumor-free mice and tumor-bearing mice, respectively.

Despite the use of instruments by many agencies within the U.S. to determine the appropriate placements for youth, research has shown that placement decisions are often influenced by factors such as gender, age, and severity of social-emotional and behavior problems. This study examined ratings of risk across multiple domains using a structured assessment tool used by caseworkers in the Rhode Island child welfare system.

Mice were divided into three groups: control (C), Plasmodium berghei infection (I) and sodium arsenite exposure with Plasmodium berghei infection (As-I). The results showed that splenocyte proliferation stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and pokeweed mitogen (PWM) was suppressed in the I group, and the suppression was more pronounced in the As-I group, suggesting that acquired immunity in infected mice was worsening following arsenic exposure. ICAM-1, an adhesion protein involved in parasite-infected red blood cell (iRBC) binding to endothelium, and HIF-1α, a hypoxia marker protein in the descending aorta, were increased in the As-I group compared to the I group. Collectively, our results suggest that arsenic may increase host susceptibility to malaria through suppression of B cell proliferation and enhancement of adhesion between iRBC and endothelium by increasing ICAM-1.;-;-;-;hard_0
1386;28192523;Bead-based immunoassay allows sub-picogram detection of histidine-rich protein 2 from Plasmodium falciparum and estimates reliability of malaria rapid diagnostic tests.;Detection of histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) from the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum provides evidence for active or recent infection, and is utilized for both diagnostic and surveillance purposes, but current laboratory immunoassays for HRP2 are hindered by low sensitivities and high costs. Here we present a new HRP2 immunoassay based on antigen capture through a bead-based system capable of detecting HRP2 at sub-picogram levels. The assay is highly specific and cost-effective, allowing fast processing and screening of large numbers of samples. We utilized the assay to assess results of HRP2-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) in different P. falciparum transmission settings, generating estimates for true performance in the field. Through this method of external validation, HRP2 RDTs were found to perform well in the high-endemic areas of Mozambique and Angola with 86.4% and 73.9% of persons with HRP2 in their blood testing positive by RDTs, respectively, and false-positive rates of 4.3% and 0.5%. However, in the low-endemic setting of Haiti, only 14.5% of persons found to be HRP2 positive by the bead assay were RDT positive. Additionally, 62.5% of Haitians showing a positive RDT test had no detectable HRP2 by the bead assay, likely indicating that these were false positive tests. In addition to RDT validation, HRP2 biomass was assessed for the populations in these different settings, and may provide an additional metric by which to estimate P. falciparum transmission intensity and measure the impact of interventions. ;polyhistidine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

Genes involved in its biogenesis and regulation are tightly regulated by PerA (BfpT), a member of the AraC/XylS family of transcriptional regulators. The aim of this work was to purify PerA and determine its association with bfpA and perA (bfpT) regulatory regions by electrophoretic mobility shift and DNase I footprinting assays. PerA was purified as a maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion, which was capable of complementing bfpA expression and which was able to restore the localized adherence phenotype of an EPEC perA mutant strain. Upstream of bfpA and perA, MBP-PerA recognized with similar affinity asymmetric nucleotide sequences in which a 29-bp-long AT-rich consensus motif was identified. These DNA motifs share 66% identity and were previously shown, by deletion analysis, to be involved in the PerA-dependent expression of both genes. Interestingly, in perA, this motif spans the sequence between positions -75 and -47, approximately one helix turn upstream of the -35 promoter sequence, while in bfpA, it spans the sequence between positions -83 and -55, approximately two helix turns upstream from the promoter. An additional PerA binding site was identified at the 5' end of the bfpA structural gene, which was not required for its activation. Experiments with LexA-PerA fusions suggested that PerA acts as a monomer to activate the transcription of both perA and bfpA, in contrast to what has been documented for other members of this family of transcriptional regulators. ;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Immunohistochemical study of sections of medulla oblongata revealed that seizures are followed by induction of c-fos IR in nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMN 10), and ventrolateral medulla (VLM), while there is negligible c-fos IR after saline sham injections. Seizures were associated with blood pressure elevation peaking at 31 +/- 17% (+/- SD) above baseline. Experimental hypertension at a similar level induced by i.p. phenylephrine also resulted in induction of c-fos IR in NTS. When seizures were preceded by antihypertensive treatment with the alpha-adrenergic antagonist, phentolamine, peak blood pressure tended to remain near the baseline level and lower than sham-injected controls. Normotensive seizures were associated with c-fos IR in NTS, DMN 10, and VLM similar to the pattern following hypertensive seizures. Seizure-induced activation of c-fos IR occurred despite normal blood pressure, and thus can be attributed to a direct effect of the seizure, and not to an indirect effect mediated by hypertension.;-;-;-;hard_0
1392;19000823;Structural basis for catalytic and inhibitory mechanisms of human prostaglandin reductase PTGR2.;PTGR2 catalyzes an NADPH-dependent reduction of the conjugated alpha,beta-unsaturated double bond of 15-keto-PGE(2), a key step in terminal inactivation of prostaglandins and suppression of PPARgamma-mediated adipocyte differentiation. Selective inhibition of PTGR2 may contribute to the improvement of insulin sensitivity with fewer side effects. PTGR2 belongs to the medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily. The crystal structures reported here reveal features of the NADPH binding-induced conformational change in a LID motif and a polyproline type II helix which are critical for the reaction. Mutation of Tyr64 and Tyr259 significantly reduces the rate of catalysis but increases the affinity to substrate, confirming the structural observations. Besides targeting cyclooxygenase, indomethacin also inhibits PTGR2 with a binding mode similar to that of 15-keto-PGE(2). The LID motif becomes highly disordered upon the binding of indomethacin, indicating plasticity of the active site. This study has implications for the rational design of inhibitors of PTGR2. ;polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function
1395;7493963;Identification of a novel Giardia lamblia cyst wall protein with leucine-rich repeats. Implications for secretory granule formation and protein assembly into the cyst wall.;Giardia lamblia trophozoites, like most intestinal parasitic protozoa, undergo fundamental biological changes to survive outside the intestine of their mammalian host by differentiating into infective cysts. This complex process entails the coordinated production, processing, and transport of cyst wall constituents for assembly into a protective cyst wall. Yet, little is known about this process and the identity of cyst wall constituents. We previously identified a 26-kDa cyst wall protein, CWP1. In the present work, using monoclonal antibodies to cyst wall antigens, we cloned the gene that encodes a novel 39-kDa cyst wall protein, CWP2. Expression of CWP1 and CWP2 was induced during encystation with identical kinetics. Soon after synthesis, these two proteins combine to form a stable complex, which is concentrated within the encystation-specific secretory granules before incorporation into the cyst wall. Both proteins contain five tandem copies of a 24-residue leucine-rich repeat, a motif implicated in protein-protein interactions. Unlike CWP1, CWP2 has an extremely basic 121-residue COOH-terminal extension that might be involved in the sorting of these proteins to the secretory granules.; polyleucine ;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

We measured hydrogen peroxide production by neutrophils and the filterability, through 5 microm Nucleopore filters, of isolated red blood cells and of diluted blood. Samples were obtained from patients undergoing aortic surgery and blood intended for transfusion: either salvaged during surgery or stored bank blood. Both salvaged and bank blood were much less filterable than patient blood, with reduced deformability of both red and white blood cells. However, salvaged blood contained highly activated neutrophils with a prolonged transit time of the 'fast-flowing' cells in the analysis compared to bank blood. Bank blood contained significantly more particles which acted as pore-blockers. Cells in bank and salvaged blood therefore have markedly abnormal flow and biochemical properties compared to patient blood.;-;-;-;hard_0
1400;8879214;Inducible nitric oxide synthase in tangle-bearing neurons of patients with Alzheimer's disease.;In Alzheimer's disease (AD), affected neurons accumulate beta amyloid protein, components of which can induce mouse microglia to express the high-output isoform of nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) in vitro. Products of NOS2 can be neurotoxic. In mice, NOS2 is normally suppressed by transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1). Expression of TGF-beta 1 is decreased in brains from AD patients, a situation that might be permissive for accumulation of NOS2. Accordingly, we investigated the expression of NOS2 in patients with AD, using three monospecific antibodies: a previously described polyclonal and two new monoclonal antibodies. Neurofibrillary tangle-bearing neurons and neuropil threads contained NOS2 in brains from each of 11 AD patients ranging in age from 47 to 81 years.

Clinical and urodynamic evaluation].;"Urinary dysfunction in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) has already been described, however its incidence, urodynamic pattern, dependence on the severity of parkinsonism as well as improvement with levodopa treatment are not exactly known. The aim of the study was to evaluate the frequency of urinary disturbances in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and their relationship to treatment with levodopa. The investigation was carried out on 41 IPD patients aged 37-84 (mean 61.6) years. The neurological examination, including evaluation of parkinsonism according to UP-DRS scale was conducted together with the urological tests, including uroflowmetry and cystometry. Patients with infection of the urinary tract and with prostate hypertrophy were excluded from the study. 32 (78%) patients had urinary symptoms: frequency in 27 cases (65%), urgency in 9 cases (21%), urge incontinence in 1 case and dysuria in 1 case. Disorders in urodynamic examination were found in 26 cases (63%); they were: detrusor hyperactivity in 21 cases (51%), prolonged time of micturition in 18 cases (44%) and decrease of maximum flow rate in 19 cases (46%). Detrusor hyperactivity was more frequent in patients with extended parkinsonian motor signs. The results of the examination indicate frequent urinary disturbances (70%) in IPD, which improve during treatment with increased dose of levodopa.";-;-;-;hard_0
1406;9260966;Mutations that render the promoter of the histidine operon of Salmonella typhimurium insensitive to nutrient-rich medium repression and amino acid downshift.;The effects of mutations in the promoter of the histidine operon of Salmonella typhimurium were examined in vivo. The wild-type chromosomal copy of the his promoter was replaced with mutations in the -10 hexamer sequence and in the region between the -10 hexamer and the transcriptional start point-termed the discriminator sequence. The substitutions were performed with a phage M13 allele replacement system. Expression of the his operon is known to correlate with levels of guanosine 5',3'-bispyrophosphate (ppGpp) in vivo. Strains containing either the wild-type his promoter or his promoter mutations were grown in both nutrient-rich and minimal media under steady-state conditions known to alter intracellular levels of ppGpp in a predictable way. The effect of the presence or absence of the his attenuator was assessed under these conditions as well. Expression of the his operon was studied by measuring the differential rate of beta-galactosidase synthesis with a his-lac transcriptional fusion. Regulation of the his operon in the promoter mutants was also studied under conditions of a transient amino acid downshift induced by the addition of serine hydroxamate to cultures growing in nutrient-rich medium. These growth conditions cause elevated levels of ppGpp. The results provide physiological confirmation of previous evidence obtained with a coupled transcription-translation system in vitro which indicated that ppGpp regulates interaction of RNA polymerase at the his promoter. More specifically, the in vivo evidence shows that the region of the his promoter that includes the -10 hexamer and discriminator sequences is the target at which ppGpp stimulates transcription.;-;-;-;hard_0

The DIET sequence uses an initial echo spacing longer than that of a conventional FSE sequence, thus allowing J coupling-induced dephasing to take effect. The sequence is evaluated theoretically, and its effectiveness on a hydrocarbon (1-pentene) is demonstrated numerically using density matrix calculations.

1412;30899588;NiSn nanoparticle-incorporated carbon nanofibers as efficient electrocatalysts for urea oxidation and working anodes in direct urea fuel cells.;Synthesis of NiSn alloy nanoparticle-incorporated carbon nanofibers was performed by calcining electrospun mats composed of nickel acetate, tin chloride and poly(vinyl alcohol) under vacuum. The electrochemical measurements indicated that utilization of tin as a co-catalyst could strongly enhance the electrocatalytic activity if its content and calcination temperature were optimized. Typically, the nanofibers prepared from calcination of an electrospun solution containing 15 wt% SnCl2 at 700 °C have a current density almost 9-fold higher than that of pristine nickel-incorporated carbon nanofibers (77 and 9 mA/cm2, respectively) at 30 °C in a 1.0 M urea solution. Furthermore, the current density increases to 175 mA/cm2 at 55 °C for the urea oxidation reaction. Interestingly, the nanofibers prepared from a solution with 10 wt% of co-catalyst precursor show an onset potential of 175 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl) at 55 °C, making this proposed composite an adequate anode material for direct urea fuel cells. Optimization of the co-catalyst content to maximize the generated current density resulted in a Gaussian function peak at 15 wt%. However, studying the influence of the calcination temperature indicated that 850 °C was the optimum temperature because synthesizing the proposed nanofibers at 1000 °C led to a decrease in the graphite content, which dramatically decreased the catalyst activity. Overall, the study opens a new venue for the researchers to exploit tin as effective co-catalyst to enhance the electrocatalytic performance of the nickel-based nanostructures. Moreover, the proposed co-catalyst can be utilized with other functional electrocatalysts to improve their activity toward oxidation of different fuels.;-;-;-;hard_0
1414;9166782;Fluorescence, phosphorescence, and optically detected magnetic resonance studies of the nucleic acid association of the nucleocapsid protein of the murine leukemia virus.;"Fluorescence, phosphorescence, and optical detection of triplet state magnetic resonance (ODMR) are employed to investigate the interaction of p10, the nucleocapsid protein of the Moloney murine leukemia virus, with nucleic acids. p10 is a 55-amino acid protein containing a single zinc finger motif, C26C29H34C39, that includes Y at position 28 and W at position 35. In addition, the interactions of a zinc finger peptide, p10-ZF, comprising residues 24-41 of p10, and a doubly mutated 24-41 peptide, p10-ZF' in which the positions of Y and W are interchanged, also are reported. The measurements focus on the direct involvement of the sole W residue in the nucleic acid interaction. Fluorescence quenching and salt-back titrations indicate complex formation of p10 with several octanucleotides--(dT)8, (dI)8, (dU)7dT, and (5-BrdU)7dT--and with the polynucleotides poly(dT) and poly(dI). Poly(dI) binds with the highest affinity. Apparent binding constants and salt-back midpoints are reported. Neither p10-ZF nor p10-ZF' exhibits significant fluorescence quenching by these DNA substrates. Binding of p10-ZF to fluorescent poly(ethenoadenylic acid) was detected with greatly reduced affinity relative to p10, but binding of p10-ZF' was undetectable. These results are in general agreement with phosphorescence and ODMR measurements monitoring W. Addition of poly(I) to p10 leads to a phosphorescence red shift, reduction in the zero-field splitting (ZFS) parameters D and E, and a significantly reduced phosphorescence lifetime, each consistent with aromatic stacking interactions between W and the nucleobases. These effects are smaller with p10-ZF and undetectable with p10-ZF'. Poly(U) produces no significant changes in the triplet state parameters of W; no stacking interactions are observed even for p10. (5-BrdU)7dT yields large phosphorescence red shifts in p10 and p10-ZF, and reductions of D, but no significant heavy atom effects. These effects probably are due to enhanced local polarizability caused by Br, but any stacking interactions in these complexes would exclude van der Waals contacts between W and the Br atoms.";polyisoleucine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function

1424;1429736;Structure and expression of the Kas12 gene encoding a beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase I isozyme from barley.;The beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) synthase I in the plant fatty acid synthetase catalyzes the condensations of acetate units to a growing acyl-ACP leading to the synthesis of palmitoyl-ACP. Barley chloroplasts contain three cerulenin sensitive beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I isoforms, alpha 2, alpha beta, and beta 2. The Kas12 gene encoding the beta 2 isozyme has been isolated and sequenced. The gene spans 3.8 kilobases and contains seven exons separated by six intervening sequences varying from 75 to 1008 base pairs in length. The mosaic gene structure is different compared with that of the beta-ketoacyl synthase in the multifunctional rat and goose fatty acid synthetases. Southern blot analyses of genomic DNA from barley, wheat, and the barley-wheat chromosome addition lines indicate that Kas12 is a single copy gene located on chromosome 2. Primer extension analyses identified four transcription start sites located 168-171 nucleotides upstream from the translation initiation codon. The Kas12 promoter lacks an appropriately positioned TATA box and contains a GC-rich region including two GC elements similar to the Sp1 transcription factor-binding site. In this regard Kas12 closely resembles a set of ubiquitously expressed eucaryotic genes. In accord with this deduction, polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the Kas12 transcript is present in barley roots, germinating embryos, developing kernels, and leaves. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

The murine anti-EGP2 (MOC31) single chain variable fragment (scFv) and the humanized anti-CD3 (Ucht1v9) scFv were cast into a diabody format (designated Dia5v9) using a short 5 amino acid Gly-Ser linker between immunoglobulin heavy-chain and light-chain variable domains.

1433;8249277;Large T-antigen and sequences within the regulatory region of JC virus both contribute to the features of JC virus DNA replication.;The requirements for the DNA replication of the human papovavirus JC were analyzed using JC T-antigen as well as the T-antigens of the related viruses SV40 and BK. With all three T-antigens, the boundary of the core origin mapped on the early side to position 5093 of the viral genome. In conjunction with earlier studies, the core origin of DNA replication was therefore defined as a 68-bp region which, similar to the SV40 core origin, contains three major structural elements, early palindrome, T-antigen binding site II, and A/T-rich tract. Replication was stimulated by sequences flanking the core origin on the early side. Specifically, the stimulating sequences on the early side were identified as T-antigen binding site I. The degree to which flanking sequences were able to stimulate viral DNA replication was dependent on the T-antigen used in the experiment, with JC T-antigen relying most and BK T-antigen relying least on the flanking sequences. SV40 T-antigen showed an intermediate dependence. The same hierarchy was observed when replication activities were compared. BK T-antigen was more active in replicating DNA than SV40 T-antigen, which in turn was more effective than JC T-antigen. Dependence on flanking sequences is, thus, inversely correlated to the replicating activity of the respective T-antigen, showing that, in addition to the origin, the T-antigen contributes to the characteristics of JC virus DNA replication.;polythreonine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
1434;7906503;Kinetics of the reduction of cytochrome b5 with mutations in its membrane-binding domain.;In an attempt to understand which amino acids in the membrane anchor of cytochrome b5 might be determinants of its ability to support the cytochrome P450-catalyzed oxidation of selected substrates, the synthetic rat cytochrome b5 gene has been mutated by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant proteins have been expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, purified and assayed for their ability to support the cytochrome P450-catalyzed metabolism of the cytochrome b5 requiring substrate methoxyflurane (G. Vergères and L. Waskell, 1992, J. Biol. Chem. 267, 12583-12591). The rate of reduction of the cytochromes b5 by cytochrome P450 reductase has been examined by stopped-flow spectrophotometry to determine whether an altered rate of reduction of cytochrome b5 could explain the observed activity of cytochrome b5 in the purified reconstituted mixed-function oxidase system. A mutant in which the 22-amino-acid membrane anchor was replaced by a sequence of 22 leucines was unable to support methoxyflurane metabolism in the reconstituted system and was reduced by cytochrome P450 reductase at a rate (k = 4.5 x 10(-3) s-1) slow enough to explain this finding. Comparison of the rate of reduction of this mutant cytochrome b5 in 0.025% Tergitol and 40 microM dilauroylphosphatidylcholine suggests that this slow rate of reduction may be explained partially by aggregation of the polyleucine protein. The Pro115Stop mutant protein, which has been truncated by 19 amino acids in its COOH terminus resulting in a protein with one-half of the putative membrane anchor, supports methoxyflurane oxidation at 12-20% of the rate of the wild type protein. In addition it is reduced by cytochrome P450 reductase at a rate which should be capable of supporting a normal rate of production formation. The fact that the Pro115Stop mutant can be reduced at a rate capable of supporting a normal rate of methoxyflurane oxidation but in fact only supports methoxyflurane oxidation at 30% of the normal rate suggests that the mutant protein is deficient in its interactions with cytochrome P450. The mutant proteins, Pro115Ala and Ala116Pro, behaved essentially as did the wild type protein demonstrating that the presence (Pro115Ala) or absence (Ala116Pro) of an alpha helix in the middle of the putative membrane-binding domain of cytochrome b5 was not a determinant of the interaction of cytochrome b5 with cytochrome P450 reductase and cytochrome P450.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) ;polyleucine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
1437;8583738;Reading grade levels and health behaviors of parents at child clinics.;"OBJECTIVES
Recent reports suggest alarmingly low levels of literacy among adults in the U.S., but these are not expressed in grade levels. Assessment of the epidemiology of reading grade levels is necessary for development of patient education materials written at appropriate levels.


METHODS
We measured demographics, reading ability and self-described health behaviors of 646 parents at two private, two university, two indigent and six public child-related clinics in a midwestern city using a bilingual oral interview and the Wide Range Achievement Test.


RESULTS
Parents were 59% white, 92% female, with mean age 28 years, mean years of school 12.1 and mean reading grade 8.7. Parents tended to read four to five grades below their highest completed school grade. Analysis of self-reported health behaviors showed that 69% had no private insurance, 31% smoked cigarettes, 35% had body mass index greater than 27, and 46% of parous mothers had never breast-fed. Prevalence odds ratios showed that all adverse health risks except obesity were associated with low reading ability.


CONCLUSIONS
These findings have important implications for public health professionals working in clinical care, health education and agency policy. Persons with low literacy levels appear to be at particularly high risk for adverse health behaviors.

1445;1939057;Phosphorylation by cdc2 kinase modulates DNA binding activity of high mobility group I nonhistone chromatin protein.;"Chromatin high mobility group protein I (HMG-I) is a mammalian nonhistone protein that has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo to preferentially bind to A.T-rich sequences of DNA. Recently the DNA-binding domain peptide that specifically mediates the in vitro interaction of high mobility group protein (HMG)-I with the narrow minor groove of A.T-DNA has been experimentally determined. Because of its predicted secondary structure, the binding domain peptide has been called ""the A.T hook"" motif. Previously we demonstrated that the A.T hook of murine HMG-I protein is specifically phosphorylated by purified mammalian cdc2 kinase in vitro and that the same site(s) are also phosphorylated in vivo in metaphase-arrested cells. We also found that the DNA binding affinity of short synthetic binding domain peptides phosphorylated in vitro by cdc2 kinase was significantly reduced compared with unphosphorylated peptides. Here we extend these findings to intact natural and recombinant HMG-I proteins. We report that the affinity of binding of full-length HMG-I proteins to A.T-rich sequences is highly dependent on ionic conditions and that phosphorylation of intact proteins by cdc2 kinase reduces their affinity of in vitro binding to A.T-DNA by about 20-fold when assayed near normal mammalian physiological salt concentrations. Furthermore, in cell synchronization studies, we demonstrated that murine HMG-I proteins are phosphorylated in vivo in a cell cycle-dependent manner on the same amino acid residues modified by purified cdc2 kinase in vitro. Together these results strongly support the assertion that HMG-I proteins are natural substrates for mammalian cdc2 kinase in vivo and that their cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation by this enzyme(s) significantly modulates their DNA binding affinity, thereby possibly altering their biological function(s).

Of 43 informative (heterozygous) tumors, 41.9% [95% confidence interval (CI)=27.0, 57.9] contained LOH at 5q21-22. LOH at 5q21-22 was strongly associated with stage at diagnosis: 100%, (3/3), 50% (13/26), and 14% (2/14) of tumors from patients with distant metastases, regional spread, and localized disease, respectively, contained this genetic alteration (P=0.01). There were no statistically significant associations between LOH at 5q21-22 and other patient or tumor characteristics, but LOH was more commonly found in the tumors of heavy smokers, infrequent alcohol consumers, and in tumors containing either p53 mutations or HPV-DNA. In univariate analyses, LOH at 5q21-22 was associated with poor prognosis (hazard ratio=1.8, 95%, CI 0.8, 4.5); this relationship did not persist after adjustment for stage of disease (hazard ratio=1.1, 95% CI=0.4, 3.1). These data provide further evidence that inactivation of the APC gene and/or other genes at 5q21-22 is common and may be involved in the development and/or progression of oral SCC. Larger studies are needed to determine whether LOH at 5q21-22 is linked to known oral SCC etiologic factors and/or the prognosis of oral SCC patients, as well as to genetic instability at other loci involved in these malignancies.";-;-;-;hard_0

1457;9806311;The development of cardiovascular disease in relation to anthropometric indices and hypertension in British adults.;"OBJECTIVE
To examine the predictive ability of simple anthropometric indices for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) over seven years in British adults, and the influence of hypertension on these associations.


DESIGN
Longitudinal study of the development of CVD (morbidity or mortality) over a seven year period in a random stratified sample of British adults who were respondents in the 1984-1985 Health and Lifestyle Survey (HALS1) and who were seen again in 1991-1992 (HALS2) or who had died by then.


METHODS
Face-to-face interviews at HALS1 and HALS2 recorded socio-demographic, health and lifestyle details followed by measurements of height, weight, waist circumference and blood pressure (BP). The quintiles of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, waist: height ratio (WHTR) and height were calculated for those aged between 35 and 75 y, at HALS1. Dates and causes of death were recorded. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios (OR) of developing CVD in 1284 men and 1570 women, aged 35-75 y who were free of known CVD, cancer and diabetes at HALS1.


RESULTS
By HALS2, 316 respondents in the qualifying population had developed CVD, 114 of whom were dead. There were linear trends in the development of CVD (adjusted for age and smoking) for all the men from the lowest to the highest quintile of WHTR (P = 0.034), but not for waist circumference (P = 0.095), or BMI (P > 0.2). Excluding the hypertensive men increased the significance of the trend for WHTR (P = 0.005) and waist circumference (P = 0.027). The significant interactions with hypertension for WHTR (P < 0.001), waist circumference (P = 0.006) and BMI (P = 0.044) showed that there was an increasing incidence of CVD with increasing adiposity in non-hypertensive men but, in men with treated hypertension, although the overall incidence of CVD was higher, the relationship with adiposity was inverse. In the women, there were no significant linear trends for waist circumference, WHTR or BMI. Quintile estimates were more consistent with J-shaped curves with the lowest risk in the second quintile. Excluding the hypertensive women, increased the significance of these trends. In normotensive women, there was a significant quadratic trend (P = 0.039) for the association between the incidence of CVD and the quintiles of waist circumference, but no associations for WHTR or BMI. For waist circumference there was weak evidence of an interaction with hypertension (P = 0.053).


CONCLUSIONS
For the men, indices involving waist circumference, particularly WHTR, had stronger linear associations with the log odds of CVD development than BMI. The interactions with hypertension were significant for WHTR, waist circumference and also BMI. In women, none of the indices was linearly associated with the log odds of CVD development, but there was a significant J-shaped curve for waist circumference and evidence of an interaction with hypertension. These results suggest that studies in which hypertensives are included, but in which possible hypertension interactions are overlooked, important hypertensive-specific associations between anthropometric indices and CVD development may be masked. Men on anti-hypertensive medication with the lowest central adiposity, experienced higher short-term CVD risk than those with greater central adiposity.";-;-;-;hard_0

Chemical and 31P-NMR analyses of these fractions indicated that at least two types of fat particles coexist in parenteral emulsions: (i) TG-rich particles (mean diameter: 330, 400, 470 nm in the 10, 20, 30% emulsion) which contain practically all the TG and esterified phytosterols of native emulsions, but only a fraction of their PL, unesterified cholesterol and phytosterols, and other minor lipids; (ii) PL-bilayer particles or liposomes (mean diameter: 80-100 nm) which are constituted with the remaining PL and relatively very small amounts of TG and other lipids. The higher the oil content of the emulsion, the lower the amount of these PL-rich particles, which represent the major particle population of the mesophase. Indeed, minute amounts of TG-rich particles (probably the smallest ones) are also present in the mesophase, even in the PL-rich subfraction which contains the bulk of liposomal PL. Since the PL-rich particles of the infused emulsion generate lipoprotein X-like particles, only the large TG-rich particles can be considered as true chylomicron counterparts.";-;-;-;hard_0

The three components share the 3-O-sulfated reducing GlcN and the 6-O-sulfated internal GlcN, indicating that they are structural variants derived from the nonreducing portion of the minimal pentasaccharide sequence required for binding to antithrombin III. Isolation of the pentasulfated component has never been reported. Their unexpected resistance to heparitinases I and II indicates that 3-O-sulfation of the reducing GlcN contributes to the resistant nature of these tetrasaccharides to the enzymes. The present study demonstrates that the nonreducing trisaccharide portion of the structural variants of the antithrombin III-binding pentasaccharide sequence can be isolated in tetrasaccharides resistant to heparinase/heparitinases I and II, while the rest of the repeating region is degraded into disaccharide units.

Swiss HIV Cohort Study.;"The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors associated with tuberculosis among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons living in Switzerland, a country with low prevalence of tuberculous infection. We performed a nested case-control study and logistic regression. Cases (n = 239) were patients participating in the Swiss-HIV Cohort study (n = 7,103), diagnosed with bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis. The rest of the cohort population was used as control. Patients from industrialized countries had a risk of tuberculosis similar to those from Switzerland (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.1; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.7-1.5); whereas the risk among patients from Eastern Europe (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.9-3.7), Brazil (OR 10.6; 95% CI 9.6-11.5), and Africa (OR 3.0; 95% CI 2.4-3.6) was markedly higher. Immune suppression, as indicated by low CD4 + cell count, was an independent risk factor for tuberculosis (OR 7.8; 95% CI 7.3-8.3 for patients with CD4 + < 50 cells.mm-3 compared to those with CD4 + > 500 cells.mm-3). Age, sex and HIV-transmission category did not appear to increase the risk of tuberculosis after adjustment for other patient characteristics. In conclusion, in countries of low prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, to originate from a country with high prevalence of tuberculosis infection and to have advanced immunodeficiency are significant risk factors for tuberculosis. They may be used to complement the tuberculin skin test in targeting patients for preventive chemotherapy.";-;-;-;hard_0
1471;24998228;Ribotrap analysis of proteins associated with FHL3 3'untranslated region in glioma cells.;To screen the proteins associated with four-and-a-half LIM domains 3 (FHL3) 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) in glioma cells. Western blot was adopted to detect the regulatory effect of poly(C)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2) on FHL3. Biotin pull-down and sliver staining were employed to screen and verify the candidate binding proteins of FHL3 3'UTR. Then liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and molecule annotation system were used to identify and analyze the candidate binding proteins. Immuno- precipitation was conducted to study the interaction between PCBP2 and polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1), a binding protein identified by LC-MS/MS. PCBP2 could bind to FHL3 mRNA 3'UTR-A and inhibited the expression of FHL3 in T98G glioms cells. 22 candidate binding proteins were identified. Among them, there were 11 RNA binding proteins, including PCBP2. PTBP1 associated with FHL3 mRNA 3'UTR and interacted with PCBP2 protein. PCBP2 and PTBP1 can both associate with FHL3 mRNA 3'UTR through forming a protein complex. ;polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
1473;7478580;The protein product of the c-cbl oncogene rapidly complexes with the EGF receptor and is tyrosine phosphorylated following EGF stimulation.;The cbl oncogene was first identified as part of a transforming retrovirus which arose in a mouse pre-B cell lymphoma. Its protein product, p120cbl, is cytoplasmic and has several distinctive domains including a highly basic region, a RING finger motif and a large proline-rich domain. A mutation to cbl in the 70Z/3 pre-B cell lymphoma produces an oncogenic protein which exhibits a marked enhancement of tyrosine phosphorylation. Parallel studies have demonstrated that p120cbl is a substrate of protein tyrosine kinases activated by engagement of the T cell antigen receptor and that cbl is phosphorylated by oncogenic forms of the Abl tyrosine kinase. A genetic analysis of the Caenorhabditis elegans cbl homologue, sli-1, demonstrates that sli-1 negatively regulates the LET-23 tyrosine kinase receptor. Here we show that p120cbl is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues following EGF stimulation and that it forms an inducible complex with the receptor. Our results also show that the oncogenic 70Z/3 form of cbl has enhanced binding to the EGF receptor and that peptides spanning the proline-rich region bind a range SH3 domains. These findings are consistent with a conserved role for cbl/sli-1 proteins in mammals and nematodes.;polyproline;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
1479;35639772;HNRNPH1 destabilizes the G-quadruplex structures formed by G-rich RNA sequences that regulate the alternative splicing of an oncogenic fusion transcript.;In the presence of physiological monovalent cations, thousands of RNA G-rich sequences can form parallel G-quadruplexes (G4s) unless RNA-binding proteins inhibit, destabilize, or resolve the formation of such secondary RNA structures. Here, we have used a disease-relevant model system to investigate the biophysical properties of the RNA-binding protein HNRNPH1's interaction with G-rich sequences. We demonstrate the importance of two EWSR1-exon 8 G-rich regions in mediating the exclusion of this exon from the oncogenic EWS-FLI1 transcripts expressed in a subset of Ewing sarcomas, using complementary analysis of tumor data, long-read sequencing, and minigene studies. We determined that HNRNPH1 binds the EWSR1-exon 8 G-rich sequences with low nM affinities irrespective of whether in a non-G4 or G4 state but exhibits different kinetics depending on RNA structure. Specifically, HNRNPH1 associates and dissociates from G4-folded RNA faster than the identical sequences in a non-G4 state. Importantly, we demonstrate using gel shift and spectroscopic assays that HNRNPH1, particularly the qRRM1-qRRM2 domains, destabilizes the G4s formed by the EWSR1-exon 8 G-rich sequences in a non-catalytic fashion. Our results indicate that HNRNPH1's binding of G-rich sequences favors the accumulation of RNA in a non-G4 state and that this contributes to its regulation of RNA processing.;polyglycine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
1489;8070411;Sp1-mediated transcriptional activation is repressed by Sp3.;Sp1, Sp3 (SPR-2) and Sp4 (SPR-1) are human sequence-specific DNA binding proteins with very similar structural features. In this report, we have analyzed Sp3 in direct comparison with Sp1. We have raised antibodies against both Sp1 and Sp3, and show that Sp3 protein, like Sp1, is expressed in various cell lines. Co-transfection experiments in different mammalian cell lines reveal that in contrast to Sp1 and Sp4, Sp3 is not able to activate several Sp1 responsive promoters. In addition, Sp3 also fails to activate reporter constructs in Drosophila SL2 cells lacking endogenous Sp factors. Instead, we find that Sp3 represses Sp1-mediated activation in a linear dose-dependent manner. A mutant of Sp3 lacking the DNA binding domain does not affect activation by Sp1, suggesting that the inhibition is most likely due to the competition with Sp1 for their common binding sites. To determine if any structurally similar domain of Sp3 is able to replace partially homologous domains of Sp1, we have generated chimeric proteins and tested their activation characteristics in gene transfer experiments. It appears that neither the glutamine-rich domains A and B nor the D domain of Sp1 can be replaced by the homologous regions of Sp3. Our results suggest that Sp3 is an inhibitory member of the Sp family.;polyglutamine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
1490;11145900;The equine herpesvirus 1 immediate-early protein interacts with EAP, a nucleolar-ribosomal protein.;The equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) immediate-early (IE) phosphoprotein is essential for the activation of transcription from viral early and late promoters and regulates transcription from its own promoter. The IE protein of 1487 amino acids contains a serine-rich tract (SRT) between residues 181 and 220. Deletion of the SRT decreased transactivation activity of the IE protein. Previous results from investigation of the ICP4 protein, the IE homolog of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), revealed that a domain containing a serine-rich tract interacts with EAP (Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small nuclear RNA-associated protein), a 15-kDa nucleolar-ribosomal protein (R. Leopardi, and B. Roizman, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93, 4572-4576, 1996). DNA binding assays revealed that (i) glutathione S-transferase (GST)-EAP disrupted the binding of HSV-1 ICP4 to its cognate DNA in a dose-dependent manner, (ii) GST-EAP interacted with the EHV-1 IE protein, but did not disrupt its binding to its cognate site in viral DNA. GST-pulldown assays indicated that the SRT of the IE protein is required for physical interaction with EAP. The IE protein and EAP colocalized in the cytoplasm of the infected equine ETCC cells at late times of the infection cycle. This latter finding may be important in EHV-1 gene regulation since late viral gene expression is greatly influenced by the EICP0 trans-activator protein whose function is antagonized by the IE protein. ;polyserine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
1491;2869483;ATP-binding site of adenylate kinase: mechanistic implications of its homology with ras-encoded p21, F1-ATPase, and other nucleotide-binding proteins.;The MgATP binding site of adenylate kinase, located by a combination of NMR and x-ray diffraction, is near three protein segments, five to seven amino acids in length, that are homologous in sequence to segments found in other nucleotide-binding phosphotransferases, such as myosin and F1-ATPase, ras p21 and transducin GTPases, and cAMP-dependent and src protein kinases, suggesting equivalent mechanistic roles of these segments in all of these proteins. Segment 1 is a glycine-rich flexible loop that, on adenylate kinase, may control access to the ATP-binding site by changing its conformation. Segment 2 is an alpha-helix containing two hydrophobic residues that interact with the adenine-ribose moiety of ATP, and a lysine that may bind to the beta- and gamma-phosphates of ATP. Segment 3 is a hydrophobic strand of parallel beta-pleated sheet, terminated by a carboxylate, that flanks the triphosphate binding site. The various reported mutations of ras p21 that convert it to a transforming agent all appear to involve segment 1, and such substitutions may alter the properties of p21 by hindering a conformational change at this segment. In F1-ATPase, the flexible loop may, by its position, control both the accessibility and the ATP/ADP equilibrium constant on the enzyme.; polyglycine ;helix;-;LCR_with_function
1492;10779504;p300 and p300/cAMP-response element-binding protein-associated factor acetylate the androgen receptor at sites governing hormone-dependent transactivation.;The androgen receptor (AR) is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that plays a key role in prostate cancer cellular proliferation by dihydrotestosterone and the induction of secondary sexual characteristics. In this study we demonstrate that the AR can be modified by acetylation in vitro and in vivo. p300 and p300/cAMP-response element-binding protein acetylated the AR at a highly conserved lysine-rich motif carboxyl-terminal to the zinc finger DNA-binding domain. [(14)C]acetate-labeling experiments demonstrated that AR acetylation by p300 in cultured cells requires the same residues identified in vitro. Point mutation of the AR acetylation site (K632A/K633A) abrogated dihydrotestosterone-dependent transactivation of the AR in cultured cells. Mutation of the p300 CH3 region or the p300/cAMP-response element-binding protein histone acetylase domain reduced ligand-dependent AR function. The identification of the AR as a direct target of histone acetyltransferase co-activators has important implications for targeting inhibitors of AR function. ;polylysine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function

In the present study, we compared gliosis in the hippocampal CA1 region of the young gerbil with those in the adult gerbil induced by 5 min of transient cerebral ischemia by immunohistochemistry and western blot for glial cells. We used male gerbils of postnatal month 1 (PM 1) as the young and PM 6 as the adult. Neuronal death in CA1 pyramidal neurons in the adult gerbil occurred at 4 days post-ischemia; the neuronal death in the young gerbil occurred at 7 days post-ischemia. The findings of glial changes in the young gerbil after ischemic damage were distinctively different from those in the adult gerbil. Glial fibrillary acidic protein-immunoreactive astrocytes, ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule (Iba-1), and isolectin B4-immunoreactive microglia in the ischemic CA1 region were activated much later in the young gerbil than in the adult gerbil.

1495;15632178;Mitotic phosphorylation rescues Abl from F-actin-mediated inhibition.;We have previously shown that F-actin exerts a negative effect on Abl tyrosine kinase activity. This inhibition results from a direct association of F-actin with the C terminus of Abl and accounts, in part, for the loss of Abl activity in detached fibroblasts. We report here that Abl from mitotic cells or cells treated with the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid remains active when detached from the extracellular matrix. Aspartic acid substitution of Thr(566), which is phosphorylated in mitotic or okadaic acid-treated cells, is sufficient to abolish F-actin-mediated inhibition and to maintain Abl activity despite cell detachment. A recent crystal structure of the Abl N-terminal region has revealed autoinhibitory interactions among the Src homology 3 (SH3), SH2, and kinase domains. We found that deletion of the SH2 domain also abolished the negative effect of F-actin on kinase activity. Immediately following the kinase domain in Abl is a proline-rich linker (PRL) that binds to several SH3 adaptor proteins. Interestingly, binding of the Crk N-terminal SH3 domain to the PRL also disrupted F-actin-mediated inhibition of Abl kinase. These results suggest that F-actin may reinforce the autoinhibitory interactions to regulate Abl kinase and that inhibition can be relieved through phosphorylation and/or protein interactions with the Abl PRL region. ;polyproline;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
1496;6741879;Bone marrow biopsy technic. Artifact induced by aspiration.;Bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy specimens are of additive value when assessing various marrow disorders. Many physicians obtain both an aspirate and a trephine core when taking a biopsy of bone marrow, but opinions differ about which biopsy specimen should be obtained first. Some authors mention the possibility of artifactual hypocellularity and hemorrhage in the trephine biopsy specimen when trephine biopsy follows aspiration at the same site. This report describes the occurrence and significance of bone marrow aspiration artifact. The artifact usually occupies a relatively small area of the biopsy specimen and satisfactory evaluation of the marrow is still possible. However, the artifact occasionally hinders marrow evaluation, particularly when the trephine biopsy specimen is relatively short. Because the artifact is not observed in specimens obtained away from the aspiration site, it is best to perform the trephine biopsy before aspiration, or away from the aspiration site, especially when technical problems prevent obtaining a large amount of trephine material.;-;-;-;hard_0
1502;8648298;"The mechanism of inward rectification of potassium channels: ""long-pore plugging"" by cytoplasmic polyamines.";"The mechanism of inward rectification was examined in cell-attached and inside-out membrane patches from Xenopus oocytes expressing the cloned strong inward rectifier HRK1. Little or no outward current was measured in cell-attached patches. Inward currents reach their maximal value in two steps: an instantaneous phase followed by a time-dependent ""activation"" phase, requiring at least two exponentials to fit the time-dependent phase. After an activating pulse, the quasi-steady state current-voltage (I-V) relationship could be fit with a single Boltzmann equation (apparent gating charge, Z = 2.0 +/- 0.1, n = 3). Strong rectification and time-dependent activation were initially maintained after patch excision into high [K+] (K-INT) solution containing 1 mM EDTA, but disappeared gradually, until only a partial, slow inactivation of outward current remained. Biochemical characterization (Lopatin, A. N., E. N. Makhina, and C. G. Nichols, 1994. Nature. 372:366-396.) suggests that the active factors are naturally occurring polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine). Each polyamine causes reversible, steeply voltage-dependent rectification of HRK1 channels. Both the blocking affinity and the voltage sensitivity increased as the charge on the polyamine increased. The sum two Boltzmann functions is required to fit the spermine and spermidine steady state block. Putrescine unblock, like Mg2+ unblock, is almost instantaneous, whereas the spermine and spermidine unblocks are time dependent. Spermine and spermidine unblocks (current activation) can each be fit with single exponential functions. Time constants of unblock change e-fold every 15.0 +/- 0.7 mV (n = 3) and 33.3 +/- 6.4 mV (n = 5) for spermine and spermidine, respectively, matching the voltage sensitivity of the two time constants required to fit the activation phase in cell-attached patches. It is concluded that inward rectification in intact cells can be entirely accounted for by channel block. Putrescine and Mg2+ ions can account for instantaneous rectification; spermine and spermidine provide a slower rectification corresponding to so-called intrinsic gating of inward rectifier K channels. The structure of spermine and spermidine leads us to suggest a specific model in which the pore of the inward rectifier channel is plugged by polyamines that enter deeply into the pore and bind at sites within the membrane field. We propose a model that takes into account the linear structure of the natural polyamines and electrostatic repulsion between two molecules inside the pore. Experimentally observed instantaneous and steady state rectification of HRK1 channels as well as the time-dependent behavior of HRK1 currents are then well fit with the same set of parameters for all tested voltages and concentrations of spermine and spermidine.";-;-;-;hard_0

Development of such an instrument was undertaken and included item generation, reduction and pilot-testing phases. By interviewing acne subjects and dermatologists and literature review, 168 possible items were identified. Next, 165 acne subjects identified which items affected them and rated importance on a 5-point scale. Reduction to a brief questionnaire was performed by evaluating patient-perceived importance and factor analysis; four domains were identified (self-perception, role-emotional, role-social, acne symptoms). After pilot-testing for comprehension in acne subjects, further revisions were made to improve clarity and applicability. The resulting instrument takes 10 minutes to complete, and consists of 24 questions assessing how acne affected certain aspects of patients' lives during the past week on a 7-point scale. Thus, an instrument with excellent content validity was developed to assess health-related quality of life in patients with facial acne, and is comprised of statistically meaningful items of importance to patients. Other measurement characteristics are being assessed in a recently initiated study to evaluate test-retest reliability and responsiveness to therapy.";-;-;-;hard_0
1505;15516976;Predisposition to mouse thymic lymphomas in response to ionizing radiation depends on variant alleles encoding metal-responsive transcription factor-1 (Mtf-1).;Genetic predisposition to cancers is significant to public health because a high proportion of cancers probably arise in a susceptible human subpopulation. Using a mouse model of gamma-ray-induced thymic lymphomas, we performed linkage analysis and haplotype mapping that suggested Mtf-1, metal-responsive transcription factor-1 (Mtf-1), as a candidate lymphoma susceptibility gene. Sequence analysis revealed a polymorphism of Mtf-1 that alters the corresponding amino acid at position 424 in the proline-rich domain from a serine in susceptibility strains to proline in resistant strains. The transcriptional activity of Mtf-1 encoding serine and proline was compared by transfecting the DNA to Mtf-1-null cells, and the change to proline conferred a higher metal responsiveness in transfections. Furthermore, the resistant congenic strains possessing the Mtf-1 allele of proline type exhibited higher radiation inducibility of target genes than susceptible background strains having the Mtf-1 allele of serine type. Since products of the targets such as metallothionein are able to suppress cellular stresses generated by irradiation, these results suggest that highly inducible strains having Mtf-1 of proline type are refractory to radiation effects and hence are resistant to lymphoma development. ;polyproline;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

To understand how tristetraprolin mechanistically functions, we biopanned with a phage-display library for proteins that interact with tristetraprolin and retrieved, among others, a fragment of poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1, which assists in the 3'-polyadenylation of mRNA by binding to immature poly(A) tails and thereby increases the activity of poly(A) polymerase, which is directly responsible for polyadenylation. The tristetraprolin/poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 interaction was characterized using tristetraprolin and poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 deletion mutants in pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Tristetraprolin interacted with the carboxyl-terminal region of poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 via its tandem zinc finger domain and another region. Although tristetraprolin and poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 are located in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, they interacted in vivo in only the nucleus. In vitro, tristetraprolin bound both poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 and poly(A) polymerase and thereby inhibited polyadenylation of AU-rich element-containing mRNAs encoding tumor necrosis factor ?, GM-CSF, and interleukin-10. A tandem zinc finger domain-deleted tristetraprolin mutant was a less effective inhibitor. Expression of a tristetraprolin mutant restricted to the nucleus resulted in downregulation of an AU-rich element-containing tumor necrosis factor ?/luciferase mRNA construct. In addition to its known cytosolic mRNA-degrading function, tristetraprolin inhibits poly(A) tail synthesis by interacting with poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 in the nucleus to regulate expression of AU-rich element-containing mRNA. ;polyalanine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function

We have examined the prothrombin dimorphism among 99 unselected outpatients with phlebography verified deep venous thrombosis, and in 282 healthy controls. The prevalence of the 20210 A allele was 7.1% (7/99) in the patient group, and 1.8% (5/282) in the healthy control group (p = 0.0095).

As previously reported, 28% of the patients were carriers of the factor V:R506Q mutation. Thus, 34% (one patient carried both traits) of unselected patients with deep venous thrombosis were carriers of an inherited prothrombotic disorder.

Five of these 17 samples were verified as positive in an antigen detection assay for histidine-rich protein 2. A comparison of alleles from these compartments indicates that single clonal infections were predominant for the cord samples, while double and triple infections were more common for peripheral and placental samples.

Absorption of lormetazepam was found to be rapid following both sublingual and oral administration. While a trend was observed towards a more rapid rate of absorption after sublingual dosing, statistically, there was no significant difference (p greater than 0.05) between the speed with which lormetazepam was absorbed following sublingual and oral dosing. After absorption, plasma lormetazepam levels rapidly reached mean (+/- s.d.) peak concentrations of 4.9 +/- 0.9 ng/ml and 5.2 +/- 1.7 ng/ml for the sublingual and oral routes, respectively, there being no significant difference (p greater than 0.05) between these values. Likewise, there was no significant difference (p greater than 0.05) in the times at which peak plasma levels were attained in the two groups. Furthermore, measurement of the area under each plasma concentration-time curve showed that the bioavailability of lormetazepam was the same for the two routes of administration. Elimination of lormetazepam followed a similar pattern following sublingual and oral dosing, the mean terminal half-lives being 13.0 h and 13.8 h, respectively. The findings in the present study clearly indicate that the plasma profiles of lormetazepam attained on sublingual and oral dosing are similar, indeed the pharmacokinetic characteristics of this drug appear identical being independent of its route of administration.;-;-;-;hard_0
1525;15715964;PLAUF is a novel P. lividus sea urchin RNA-binding protein.;"Preliminary results have shown that various proteins bind long 3'UTR of the transcript for Paracentrotus lividus sea urchin H3.3 histone variant and are probably implicated in mRNA instability. In order to identify these RNA-binding proteins, we screened a lambda-ZAPII cDNA expression library prepared from poly(A) mRNA extracted from sea urchin embryos at blastula stage. We isolated a cDNA that codes for a novel RNA-binding protein homologous to rat and human AUF1 family proteins and we refer to it as PLAUF. Proteins present in the whole lysate of the phages expressing PLAUF bound specifically in vitro the 3'UTR of the H3.3 histone transcript. Northern blot analysis revealed three PLAUF transcripts that are already present in unfertilized eggs; during development their amount increased starting from 4-blastomere embryos and reached the plateau at blastula stage. While the transcription start point was unique, longer 3'UTRs were revealed by 3'RACE approach and further cDNA library screening. Moreover RT-PCR showed the presence of at least one alternative spliced mRNA that codes for a protein with different COOH terminus. The structure of the PLAUF gene was determined by screening a P. lividus sea urchin genomic library with the PLAUF cDNA as probe. Analysis of the positive clones showed that the PLAUF gene is split in 10 exons and 9 introns spanning a distance of about 10 kb. Moreover we demonstrated that the exon 9 was alternative spliced during mRNA processing. ";polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
1526;10595452;A direct binding assay for thyrotropin receptor autoantibodies.;"There is, at present, no assay in clinical use for the direct assay of autoantibody binding to the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR). We now describe a direct thyrotropin receptor autoantibody binding assay (DTAb) using a secreted form of the TSHR ectodomain (TSHR-289) without the need for antigen purification. The assay compensates for the low TSHR autoantibody concentration in serum by capturing a relatively large amount of patient immunoglobulin G (IgG) on high-capacity beads, a reversal of standard methods that typically first immobilize antigen. TSHR-289 captured by Graves' IgG was detected in a colorimetric reaction using a biotinylated murine monoclonal antibody to the poly-histidine tail engineered into the antigen. By this approach, sera from 11 normal individuals provided a mean optical density (OD) value of 0.20 +/- 0.08 SD (range 0.06-0.33). Of 38 sera from unselected patients with a history of Graves' disease (untreated and treated), 29 (76%) generated OD values > 0.37 (2 SD above the mean for the normal sera), the highest being OD 1.38. Surprisingly, 3 of 13 (23%) sera from TPO autoantibody-positive patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis also provided values > 2 SD above the normal sera. The extent of direct autoantibody binding to the TSHR correlated closely with the thyrotropin binding inhibition (TBI) values (r = 0.881; p < 0.001). One serum was clearly positive in only the direct binding assay and another in only the TBI assay. The data obtained with the direct binding assay correlated less well with the thyroid-stimulating antibody (TSAb) assay (r = 0.582; p < 0.001). In summary, we describe a new direct DTAb assay that correlates more closely with the TBI than with the TSI assays. Future studies in a large series of clinically defined patients will be needed to evaluate the clinical utility of the DTAb assay. ";polyhistidine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

Moreover, overexpression of the Jmj protein in COS-7 and NIH3T3 cells remarkably reduced cell proliferation compared with control cells transfected with vector alone. These results show that the Jmj protein acts in cell nuclei and participates in the negative regulation of cell proliferation signaling. ;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
1530;2196566;The B subunit of a rat heteromeric CCAAT-binding transcription factor shows a striking sequence identity with the yeast Hap2 transcription factor.;CBF is a heteromeric mammalian transcription factor that binds to CCAAT sequences in a number of promoters such as the two type I collagen promoters, the albumin promoter, the major histocompatibility complex class II promoter, and others. It is composed of two components, A and B, that are both needed for DNA binding. We have isolated a rat cDNA containing the complete 341-amino acid coding sequence of the B component of CBF. Expression of this cDNA in vitro generates a polypeptide that shows the same dependency on the A component as the native B component in the formation of a complex with a CCAAT-containing DNA. The C-terminal portion of the B component from residue 260 to residue 312 shows a 75% sequence identity with a portion of the Hap2 protein, a component of a heteromeric CCAAT-binding protein in yeast. In contrast, the rest of the protein shows little sequence homology with Hap2, although both proteins contain glutamine-rich domains. In the B component of CBF this domain spans the amino-terminal 60% of the protein, whereas in Hap2 this domain is much smaller. Hence, only a few changes in one domain of this protein were tolerated during evolution between yeast and mammals, whereas the rest of the protein diverged much more extensively. ;polyglutamine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
1531;9271405;The matrix attachment region-binding protein SATB1 participates in negative regulation of tissue-specific gene expression.;The nuclear matrix has been implicated in several cellular processes, including DNA replication, transcription, and RNA processing. In particular, transcriptional regulation is believed to be accomplished by binding of chromatin loops to the nuclear matrix and by the concentration of specific transcription factors near these matrix attachment regions (MARs). A number of MAR-binding proteins have been identified, but few have been directly linked to tissue-specific transcription. Recently, we have identified two cellular protein complexes (NBP and UBP) that bind to a region of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) long terminal repeat (LTR) previously shown to contain at least two negative regulatory elements (NREs) termed the promoter-proximal and promoter-distal NREs. These NREs are absent from MMTV strains that cause T-cell lymphomas instead of mammary carcinomas. We show here that NBP binds to a 22-bp sequence containing an imperfect inverted repeat in the promoter-proximal NRE. Previous data showed that a mutation (p924) within the inverted repeat elevated basal transcription from the MMTV promoter and destabilized the binding of NBP, but not UBP, to the proximal NRE. By using conventional and affinity methods to purify NBP from rat thymic nuclear extracts, we obtained a single major protein of 115 kDa that was identified by protease digestion and partial sequencing analysis as the nuclear matrix-binding protein special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 1 (SATB1). Antibody ablation, distamycin inhibition of binding, renaturation and competition experiments, and tissue distribution data all confirmed that the NBP complex contained SATB1. Similar types of experiments were used to show that the UBP complex contained the homeodomain protein Cux/CDP that binds the MAR of the intronic heavy-chain immunoglobulin enhancer. By using the p924 mutation within the MMTV LTR upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene, we generated two strains of transgenic mice that had a dramatic elevation of reporter gene expression in lymphoid tissues compared with reporter gene expression in mice expressing wild-type LTR constructs. Thus, the 924 mutation in the SATB1-binding site dramatically elevated MMTV transcription in lymphoid tissues. These results and the ability of the proximal NRE in the MMTV LTR to bind to the nuclear matrix clearly demonstrate the role of MAR-binding proteins in tissue-specific gene regulation and in MMTV-induced oncogenesis. ;polythreonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
1533;9843664;Parameters for the two-dimensional crystallization of the membrane protein microsomal glutathione transferase.;Various crystallization parameters were investigated to obtain two-dimensional crystals of the detoxification enzyme microsomal glutathione transferase for structural analysis by electron crystallography. The protein was crystallized by reconstitution of the solubilized trimer into proteoliposomes. Crystallization occurs when minimal amounts of lipid in the range of three lipid molecules per protein trimer are added to the dialysate. Once crystals were obtained, the effect of several parameters on the crystallization was determined. The temperature and initial detergent concentration were found to be crucial parameters in influencing the size of the crystals, and conclusions could be drawn about the rate dependence of the crystallization process. Two highly ordered crystal forms, which are suitable for structural analysis by electron crystallography, were obtained under the two-dimensional crystallization conditions described here.;-;-;-;hard_0
1539;6320166;Mapping of the late promoter of simian virus 40.;"Mapping of the simian virus 40 (SV40) late promoter was carried out in the absence of the viral early protein, large tumor (T) antigen, and replication of the viral DNA template. SV40 late control region DNA fragments, containing specific deletions, were cloned directly upstream from the coding region of the herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) thymidine kinase (TK; ATP:thymidine 5'-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.21) gene (tk). The promoter activities of the fragments were determined by measuring the tk transformation frequencies of the chimeric tk constructs in mouse L TK- APRT- (adenine phosphoribosyltransferase-negative) and human 143B TK- cell lines. The following results were obtained. (i) The SV40 control region functions with equal efficiencies in the early and late promoter orientations. (ii) A major late control element has been localized within the G+C-rich 21-base-pair (bp) repeat. Thus, in conjunction with our earlier results, the 21-bp repeat is a bidirectional promoter element functioning as a major component of both the early and late promoters and is an element that enhances the replication efficiency of SV40 DNA. (iii) Minor late promoters have been localized within the minimal replication origin and the 72-bp repeat. (iv) The minimal replication origin is not per se a constituent of the major late promoter; however, both the minimal replication origin and the 21-bp repeat are required for obtaining high levels of late gene expression observed at late times after infection by SV40. (v) The 72-bp repeat exerts a 4- to 5-fold enhancement of late promoter expression.";polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
1542;8911084;[A case study of immunohistochemical findings of rheumatic pseudocystic lesions in the femoral lateral condyle and tibial plateau--the comparison with synovial lesions].;Rheumatoid pseudocysts of which pathogenesis are not well known, are commonly observed in the major joints of the body, especially knees in rheumatoid patients. This report investigated the pseudocysts in the knee of a rheumatoid patient radiologically and immunohistochemically. A sixty-three-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis who had pseudocysts in the femoral lateral condyle and tibial plateau was hospitalized to have the lesions surgically removed. The MRI findings showed a connection between the pseudocysts and the joint cavity. A window of 1 x 1 cm2 was made at the tibial anterior cortex and the contents of the pseudocyst were resected and hydroxyapatite granules were inserted into the lesion after the removal of the pseudocyst tissue. In the histological findings, the specimen from the tibial pseudocyst revealed fibrous connective tissue with a few inflammatory cells, while the synovial specimen revealed the fibrous tissue with intense inflammatory cells infiltration forming lymphoid follicules. In immunohistochemical findings, both specimens showed positive with anti-HLA class I, anti-HLA DR, anti-CD44 and anti-HSP70 antibodies. The pathological findings of the pseudocystic lesion were similar to those of synovia, and it was considered that the synovia had invaded into the bone and formed the pseudocystic lesion. The MRI findings also support this hypothesis. The pseudocystic lesion was surrounded by bone and it was isolated from cytokain-rich joint effusion. This isolation from rheumatic joint effusion may explain the weaker inflammation of the pseudocystic lesion than that of synovia.;-;-;-;hard_0
1543;8806843;Identification of a cell-specific transcription activation domain within the human Ah receptor nuclear translocator.;In the presence of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and related chemicals, the Ah receptor nuclear translocator (Arnt) forms a heterodimeric complex with the ligand-bound Ah receptor, leading to recognition of dioxin-responsive elements within the enhancer of the CYP1A1 gene and transcription activation by an unknown mechanism. To understand the role of Arnt in transcription activation by the Ah receptor-Arnt heterodimer, we performed a deletion analysis of Arnt to locate domains that are directly involved in transcription activation. We showed that the C-terminal 34 amino acids of Arnt encode a transcription activation domain (TAD) that functions independently of other sequences in the Ah receptor complex when attached to the heterologous Gal4 DNA binding domain. Deletion of the C-terminal acidic-rich 14 amino acids completely abolishes activity. Sequences important in Arnt TAD function were independent of the glutamine-rich region which is an important structural feature in the TAD of other transcription factors. The strength of the Arnt TAD when compared with the strong TAD from the herpes simplex virus VP16 protein was cell-type specific. Both the Arnt and VP16 TAD were equally strong in COS-1 cells, but the Arnt TAD had weak activity in an Arnt-deficient mouse hepatoma cell line and was not needed for restoration of CYP1A1 activation. These results imply that for CYP1A1 activation the Ah receptor provides the dominant activation function for the heterodimer in hepatoma cells. The potential of the Arnt TAD to contribute to activation by the Ah receptor complex is likely determined by availability or activity of cell-specific factors with which the TAD interacts. ;polyglutamine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
1544;9341142;Adhesion and activation of human platelets induced by convulxin involve glycoprotein VI and integrin alpha2beta1.;We analyzed the interaction of convulxin (Cvx), a 72-kDa protein isolated from the venom of Crotalus durissus terrificus, with human platelets. Cvx is a potent platelet agonist that induces an increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), granule exocytosis and aggregation. 125I-Labeled Cvx binds specifically and rapidly to platelets at binding sites of high and moderate affinity. Platelets adhere to immobilized Cvx in a time-dependent but cation-independent manner. Platelet exocytosis and aggregation induced by Cvx were inhibited by an anti-integrin alpha2beta1 monoclonal antibody (6F1) and by the Fab fragments of a polyclonal anti-glycoprotein VI (GPVI) antibody. Both the adhesion of platelets to Cvx and the Cvx-induced increase in [Ca2+]i were inhibited by anti-GPVI Fab fragments but not by 6F1. Ligand blotting assay showed that 125I-Cvx binds to a 57-kDa platelet protein with an electrophoretic mobility identical to that of GPVI. In addition, we observed the following: (i) 125I-Cvx binds to GPVI immunoprecipitated by the anti-GPVI antibody from a platelet lysate, and (ii) Cvx inhibits the binding of anti-GPVI IgG to GPVI. Taken together, these results demonstrate that GPVI behaves as a Cvx receptor and that the alpha2beta1 integrin appears to be involved in the later stages of Cvx-induced platelet activation, i.e. exocytosis and aggregation.;-;-;-;hard_0
1548;8542985;Onchocerca volvulus: identification and characterization of an immunogenic eggshell protein (Oveg1).;A major antigen recognized by human sera in Onchocerca volvulus infections is a parasite eggshell protein. The cDNA clone for this antigen was isolated from a lambda gt11 O. volvulus cDNA library using antisera from patients with high microfilarial counts. Sequence analysis of the cDNA clone predicts a polyglutamine repeat near the 5' end of the cDNA, and a motif of four arginines near the 3' end, reminiscent of that found in many regulatory proteins. The cDNA was subcloned into a yeast expression vector and reagent quantities of recombinant antigen produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Antisera produced to the recombinant purified protein localized the antigen to the eggshell of developing microfilariae within the adult female uterus. No other sites of Oveg1 expression were noted in adult worms, but labeling was seen in internal membrane structures of L3 larvae.

1550;6092791;Age-dependent changes of nuclear envelope protein phosphokinase and protein phosphatase activities. Significance for altered nucleo-cytoplasmic mRNA translocation during development.;"Nuclear envelopes are associated with a protein phosphokinase and a phosphoprotein phosphatase, whose activities are modulated by poly(A) in an opposite manner. The activities of these enzymes were determined in nuclear ghosts from liver and oviduct of quails of different age and of different hormone status. Under optimal conditions, kinase activity was found to increase in immature animals 8-fold in response to diethylstilbestrol; co-administration of progesterone had no marked effect on enzyme activity. After the initial burst, the activity of the enzyme increased only slightly during ageing. Two proteins present in nuclear ghosts of Mr 64 000 and of Mr 106 000 are phosphorylated during the kinase reaction; both the relative and the absolute extents of phosphate incorporation into these proteins alter drastically during ageing or hormone treatment of immature animals. Like the kinase activity, the activity of protein phosphatase increased in immature animals markedly in response to hormone treatment. Thereafter the activity remained constant in liver while in oviducts the phosphatase activity dropped to 30% in both mature and old animals. ";polyalanine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function

Here it is reported that IE63 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttle protein able to travel from snRNP- and RNA-rich nuclear foci to the cytoplasm, where it accumulates during actinomycin D treatment. This newly identified property suggests that IE63 facilitates nuclear export of HSV-1 transcripts, in addition to retaining intron-containing transcripts in the nucleus. The mechanism by which IE63 controls RNA export has yet to be defined. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

In 9 responders, the active renin increased markedly while the inactive renin decreased. On the other hand, in 20 non-responders, both renin activities increased only slightly.

1554;9698566;Crystal structure of the abl-SH3 domain complexed with a designed high-affinity peptide ligand: implications for SH3-ligand interactions.;"The Abl-SH3 domain is implicated in negative regulation of the Abl kinase by mediating protein-protein interactions. High-affinity SH3 ligands could compete for these interactions and specifically activate the Abl kinase, providing control and a better understanding of the molecular interactions that underlie diseases where SH3 domains are involved. The p41 peptide (APSYSPPPPP) is a member of a group of peptide ligands designed to bind specifically the Abl-SH3 domain. It binds to Abl-SH3 with a Kd of 1.5 microM, whereas its affinity for the Fyn-SH3 domain is 273 microM. We have determined the crystal structure of the Abl-SH3 domain in complex with the high-affinity peptide ligand p41 at 1.6 A resolution. In the crystal structure, this peptide adopts a polyproline type II helix conformation through residue 5 to 10, and it binds in type I orientation to the Abl-SH3 domain. The tyrosine side-chain in position 4 of the peptide is hydrogen bonded to two residues in the RT-loop of the Abl-SH3 domain. The tight fit of this side-chain into the RT-loop pocket is enhanced by conformational adjustment of the main chain at position 5. The SH3 ligand peptides can be divided into two distinct parts. The N-terminal part binds to the SH3 domain in the region formed by the valley between the nSrc and RT-loops. It determines the specificity for different SH3 domains. The C-terminal part adopts a polyproline type II helix conformation. This binds to a well-conserved hydrophobic surface of the SH3 domain. Analysis of two ""half""-peptides, corresponding to these ligand parts, shows that both are essential components for strong binding to the SH3 domains. The crystal structure of the Abl-SH3:p41 complex explains the high affinity and specificity of the p41 peptide towards the Abl-SH3 domain, and reveals principles that will be exploited for future design of small, high-affinity ligands to interfere efficiently with the in vivo regulation of Abl kinase activity.

1557;9673795;Antinociceptive and morphine modulatory actions of spinal orphanin FQ.;Orphanin FQ (nociceptin, OFQ), a hepatdecapeptide peptide, has been designated as an endogenous ligand at the orphan receptor ORL1, which lacks affinity for opioid receptor ligands. OFQ-like immunoreactivity has been localized in spinal cord areas that are involved in the processing of nociceptive signals. In this study, the effects of spinally administered OFQ on thermal and mechanical nociceptive stimuli were investigated following intrathecal (i.t.) injection in unanesthetized rats bearing chronic indwelling catheters in the subarachnoid space. Intrathecal OFQ produced two distinct acute actions: an opioid-like antinociceptive effect, and antagonism of morphine-induced antinociception. Chronic administration produces tolerance. Acute actions were as follows. First, injection of OFQ alone in the dose range 10-100 nmol produced sustained antinociceptive effects in the tail-flick (baseline latency 1.5-2 s) and paw-pressure tests. These effects peaked at 45-60 min post-injection, were fully reversible, and were observed in absence of discernable motor impairments. Intrathecal naloxone (5 nmol) significantly attenuated the antinociceptive effects of OFQ (50 nmol i.t.) in tail-flick and paw-pressure tests. A 24-h pretreatment with the irreversible opioid receptor antagonist, beta-flunatrexamine (2 nmol i.t.), also attenuated the antinociceptive effects of OFQ (50, 100 nmol i.t.) and of morphine (7.5 nmol i.t.) in both tests. Low doses (1, 5 nmol) of OFQ, which failed to produce antinociception in the tail-flick test involving a baseline latency of 1.5-2 s, produced a strong antinociceptive response when the baseline latency was increased to 5-6 s. Second, intrathecal OFQ, at doses (0.5, 1.0, and 5.0 nmol) that had no antinociceptive activity in the tail-flick (baseline latency 1.5-2 s) and paw-pressure tests, attenuated the antinociceptive effect of morphine (7.5 nmol i.t.) in these tests. However, a threshold OFQ dose (10 nmol) significantly extended the duration of antinociception induced by morphine (7.5 nmol i.t.) or deltorphin (20 nmol i.t.). Chronic actions were as follows. In rats that were rendered tolerant to spinal morphine, by a continuous intrathecal infusion (7.5 nmol/h) of the agonist for 5 days, the OFQ dose-response curves for its antinociceptive effect in the tail-flick and paw-pressure tests were significantly shifted to the right. In separate experiments, repeated intrathecal injection of OFQ (50 nmol) or morphine (7.5 nmol) produced a significant decline in their antinociceptive effects. Thus, intrathecally administered OFQ produces both development of tolerance to its antinociceptive actions and cross-tolerance to the action of morphine.;-;-;-;hard_0

The randomly cell-populated scaffolds usually used for tissue engineering often fail to mimic the highly anisotropic characteristics of native tissue. In this work, an ultrasound standing-wave-based tissue engineering acoustophoretic (TEA) set-up was developed to organize murine mesenchymal stromal cells (mMSCs) in an in situ polymerizing 3-D fibrin hydrogel. The resultant constructs, consisting of 17 cell layers spaced at 300 µm, were obtained by continuous wave ultrasound applied at a 2.5 MHz frequency. The patterned mMSCs preserved the structured behavior within 10 days of culturing in osteogenic conditions. Cell viability was moderately increased 1 day after the patterning; it subdued and evened out, with the cells randomly encapsulated in hydrogels, within 21 days of culturing. Cells in the structured hydrogels exhibited enhanced expression of certain osteogenic markers, i.e., Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), osterix (Osx) transcription factor, collagen-1 alpha1 (COL1A1), osteopontin (OPN), osteocalcin (OCN), and osteonectin (ON), as well as of certain cell-cycle-progression-associated genes, i.e., Cyclin D1, cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (CYR61), and anillin (ANLN), when cultured with osteogenic supplements and, for ANLN, also in the expansion media. Additionally, OPN expression was also augmented on day 5 in the patterned gels cultured without the osteoinductive media, suggesting the pro-osteogenic influence of the patterned cell organization. The TEA set-up proposes a novel method for non-invasively organizing cells in a 3-D environment, potentially enhancing the regenerative properties of the designed anisotropic constructs for bone healing.";polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
1569;1885006;Different activation domains of Sp1 govern formation of multimers and mediate transcriptional synergism.;The process of transcriptional activation in eukaryotes by site-specific DNA-binding proteins is a key step in gene regulation. Here we have examined the properties of four distinct activator domains of the human transcription factor Sp1. In vivo transient cotransfection assays with Sp1 show that templates bearing multiple Sp1 sites activate transcription with a high degree of synergism. However, there is no evidence of cooperative binding of Sp1 to adjacent sites. Using deletion mutants of Sp1 we have determined that the glutamine-rich activation domains A and B and the previously uncharacterized carboxy-terminal domain D are all required for Sp1 to activate transcription synergistically. Gel-shift, DNase footprinting, and chemical cross-linking experiments reveal a strong correlation between the ability of Sp1 mutants to form homomultimeric complexes and their ability to activate transcription synergistically when bound to multiple sites. We have also examined the process of superactivation, in which a molecule of Sp1 tethered to DNA via its zinc fingers can be transcriptionally enhanced by interacting directly with fingerless Sp1 molecules. The domains involved in superactivation appear to be a subset of those necessary to achieve synergistic activation. These findings suggest that different domains of Sp1 carry out distinct functions and that the formation of multimeric complexes may direct synergism and superactivation. ;polyglutamine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

Because differentiation increases ferritin formation in several cell types, thereby leading to an accumulation of H-rich isoferritins, we investigated whether differentiation affects iron metabolism in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes. To this aim, we evaluated the expression of the genes coding for the H and L ferritin subunits and for cytoplasmic iron regulatory protein (IRP) during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells in adipocytes induced by the addition of isobutylmethylxanthine, insulin, and dexamethasone. Differentiation enhanced ferritin formation and caused overexpression of the H subunit, thus altering the H/L subunit ratio. Northern blot analysis showed increased levels of H subunit mRNA. A gel retardation assay of cytoplasmic extract from differentiated cells, using an iron-responsive element as a probe, revealed enhanced an RNA binding capacity of IRP1, which correlated with the increase of IRP1 mRNA. The observed correlation between differentiation and iron metabolism in adipocytes suggests that an accumulation of H-rich isoferritin may limit the toxicity of iron in adipose tissue, thus exerting an antioxidant function. ;polyhistidine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

1576;35776134;Molecular insights into the interaction of CAG trinucleotide RNA repeats with nucleolin and its implication in polyglutamine diseases.;Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are a type of inherited neurodegenerative disorders caused by cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) trinucleotide expansion within the coding region of the disease-associated genes. We previously demonstrated that a pathogenic interaction between expanded CAG RNA and the nucleolin (NCL) protein triggers the nucleolar stress and neuronal cell death in polyQ diseases. However, mechanisms behind the molecular interaction remain unknown. Here, we report a 1.45 Å crystal structure of the r(CAG)5 oligo that comprises a full A'-form helical turn with widened grooves. Based on this structure, we simulated a model of r(CAG)5 RNA complexed with the RNA recognition motif 2 (RRM2) of NCL and identified NCL residues that are critical for its binding to CAG RNA. Combined with in vitro and in vivo site-directed mutagenesis studies, our model reveals that CAG RNA binds to NCL sites that are not important for other cellular functions like gene expression and rRNA synthesis regulation, indicating that toxic CAG RNA interferes with NCL functions by sequestering it. Accordingly, an NCL mutant that is aberrant in CAG RNA-binding could rescue RNA-induced cytotoxicity effectively. Taken together, our study provides new molecular insights into the pathogenic mechanism of polyQ diseases mediated by NCL-CAG RNA interaction.;polyglutamine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
1577;10906280;Augmented humoral immune function in metallothionein-null mice.;Stress response proteins can play integral roles as modulators of cellular function and can be involved in mechanisms that are important to immune function. Metallothionein (MT), a cysteine-rich stress response protein, has been shown to play numerous roles in the cell: it serves as a reservoir of essential heavy metals, it scavenges free radicals, and it can sequester heavy metals. These various functions suggest that MT may also participate in modulating immune responses. In previous work, we have shown that exogenous metallothionein can suppress the developing humoral immune response when coinjected with antigen. The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of endogenous MT on the development of humoral immunity. We compared the humoral immune function of animals with a targeted disruption of Mt-1 and -2 genes (MTKO) and their wild-type counterparts. MTKO mice displayed a significantly higher humoral response to challenge with ovalbumin (OVA) compared to wild-type controls. The secondary anti-OVA response in MTKO mice is as much as 58% higher than the response in control mice injected at the same time. Overall circulatory immunoglobulin levels are also substantially higher in MTKO mice (0.039 mg/ml IgM and 0.42 mg/ml IgG) than wild-type controls. MTKO mice displayed increased B cell differentiation following OVA challenge and an enhanced lymphoproliferative response to mitogenic stimulation. These changes in immune functional capacity occur in the context of changes in the makeup of the lymphoid compartments of the blood and spleen. There are substantially fewer T and B cells in the circulation of MTKO mice, but more T cells in the spleen of these mice than in control animals. Finally, we have found that splenocytes from MTKO animals displayed significantly elevated levels of NF-kappaB activity compared to wild-type controls. In conclusion, we have provided evidence that endogenous metallothionein can modulate the immune response in vivo and that intracellular MT may modulate immune function by regulation of transcription factor activity. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
1578;1339378;Regulation of alpha-amylase-encoding gene expression in germinating seeds and cultured cells of rice.;Four alpha-amylase-encoding cDNA (alpha Amy-C) clones were isolated from a cDNA library derived from poly(A)+RNA of gibberellic acid (GA3)-treated rice aleurone layers. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicates that the four cDNAs were derived from different alpha Amy genes. Expression of the individual alpha Amy gene in germinating seeds and cultured suspension cells of rice was studied using gene-specific probes. In germinating seeds, expression of the alpha Amy genes is positively regulated by GA3 in a temporally coordinated but quantitatively distinct manner. In cultured suspension cells, in contrast, expression of the alpha Amy genes is negatively and differentially regulated by sugars present in the medium. In addition, one strong and one weak carbohydrate-starvation-responsive alpha Amy genes have been identified. Interactions between the promoter region (HS501) of a rice alpha Amy gene and GA3-inducible DNA binding proteins in rice aleurone cells were also studied. A DNA mobility-shift assay showed that the aleurone proteins interact with two specific DNA fragments within HS501. One fragment is located between nt -131 to -170 and contains two imperfect directly repeated pyrimidine elements and a putative GA3-response element. The other fragment is located between nt -92 to -130 that contains a putative enhancer sequence. The interactions between aleurone proteins and these two fragments are sequence-specific and GA-responsive. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
1580;28973460;Distinct roles of Pcf11 zinc-binding domains in pre-mRNA 3'-end processing.;New transcripts generated by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) are generally processed in order to form mature mRNAs. Two key processing steps include a precise cleavage within the 3' end of the pre-mRNA, and the subsequent polymerization of adenosines to produce the poly(A) tail. In yeast, these two functions are performed by a large multi-subunit complex that includes the Cleavage Factor IA (CF IA). The four proteins Pcf11, Clp1, Rna14 and Rna15 constitute the yeast CF IA, and of these, Pcf11 is structurally the least characterized. Here, we provide evidence for the binding of two Zn2+ atoms to Pcf11, bound to separate zinc-binding domains located on each side of the Clp1 recognition region. Additional structural characterization of the second zinc-binding domain shows that it forms an unusual zinc finger fold. We further demonstrate that the two domains are not mandatory for CF IA assembly nor RNA polymerase II transcription termination, but are rather involved to different extents in the pre-mRNA 3'-end processing mechanism. Our data thus contribute to a more complete understanding of the architecture and function of Pcf11 and its role within the yeast CF IA complex. ;polyalanine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
1581;32571919;Antifungal symbiotic peptide NCR044 exhibits unique structure and multifaceted mechanisms of action that confer plant protection.;In the indeterminate nodules of a model legume Medicago truncatula, ∼700 nodule-specific cysteine-rich (NCR) peptides with conserved cysteine signature are expressed. NCR peptides are highly diverse in sequence, and some of these cationic peptides exhibit antimicrobial activity in vitro and in vivo. However, there is a lack of knowledge regarding their structural architecture, antifungal activity, and modes of action against plant fungal pathogens. Here, the three-dimensional NMR structure of the 36-amino acid NCR044 peptide was solved. This unique structure was largely disordered and highly dynamic with one four-residue α-helix and one three-residue antiparallel β-sheet stabilized by two disulfide bonds. NCR044 peptide also exhibited potent fungicidal activity against multiple plant fungal pathogens, including Botrytis cinerea and three Fusarium spp. It inhibited germination in quiescent spores of B. cinerea In germlings, it breached the fungal plasma membrane and induced reactive oxygen species. It bound to multiple bioactive phosphoinositides in vitro. Time-lapse confocal and superresolution microscopy revealed strong fungal cell wall binding, penetration of the cell membrane at discrete foci, followed by gradual loss of turgor, subsequent accumulation in the cytoplasm, and elevated levels in nucleoli of germlings. Spray-applied NCR044 significantly reduced gray mold disease symptoms caused by the fungal pathogen B. cinerea in tomato and tobacco plants, and postharvest products. Our work illustrates the antifungal activity of a structurally unique NCR peptide against plant fungal pathogens and paves the way for future development of this class of peptides as a spray-on fungistat/fungicide.;polycysteine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
1582;8742320;Protection against acetaminophen hepatotoxicity by a single dose of clofibrate: effects on selective protein arylation and glutathione depletion.;Previous reports demonstrated that repeated administration of peroxisome proliferators protects against acetaminophen (APAP) hepatotoxicity in mice. This protection was associated with a decrease in APAP's selective protein arylation and glutathione depletion. This study was conducted to determine if a single dose of clofibrate (CFB), rather than repeated doses, would similarly prevent APAP toxicity. CD-1 male mice received a single dose of 500 mg CFB/kg and controls were given corn oil 24 hr prior to APAP challenge. After an 18-hr fast, mice were challenged with 800 mg APAP/kg (in 50% propylene glycol) and killed at 4 or 12 hr. Other mice similarly pretreated were killed without APAP challenge. The results showed that pretreatment with a single CFB dose significantly decreased APAP-induced hepatotoxicity. At 12 hr after APAP plasma sorbitol dehydrogenase activity and the severity of hepatocellular necrosis were decreased in CFB pretreated mice. Surprisingly, no differences in hepatic nonprotein sulfhydryl (NPSH) depletion or selective arylation of target proteins in cytosol were observed at 4 hr after APAP challenge. Neither did a single dose of CFB significantly alter hepatic NPSH content prior to APAP challenge. These results indicate that protection against APAP hepatotoxicity by CFB does not require repeated administration, and the absence of significant alterations in APAP's selective protein arylation or glutathione depletion suggests that the protection against APAP hepatotoxicity after a single treatment with CFB may differ mechanistically from the protection observed after repeated CFB dosing.;-;-;-;hard_0
1587;27482114;CCN1/CYR61-mediated meticulous patrolling by Ly6Clow monocytes fuels vascular inflammation.;Inflammation is characterized by the recruitment of leukocytes from the bloodstream. The rapid arrival of neutrophils is followed by a wave of inflammatory lymphocyte antigen 6 complex (Ly6C)-positive monocytes. In contrast Ly6C(low) monocytes survey the endothelium in the steady state, but their role in inflammation is still unclear. Here, using confocal intravital microscopy, we show that upon Toll-like receptor 7/8 (TLR7/8)-mediated inflammation of mesenteric veins, platelet activation drives the rapid mobilization of Ly6C(low) monocytes to the luminal side of the endothelium. After repeatedly interacting with platelets, Ly6C(low) monocytes commit to a meticulous patrolling of the endothelial wall and orchestrate the subsequent arrival and extravasation of neutrophils through the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. At a molecular level, we show that cysteine-rich protein 61 (CYR61)/CYR61 connective tissue growth factor nephroblastoma overexpressed 1 (CCN1) protein is released by activated platelets and enables the recruitment of Ly6C(low) monocytes upon vascular inflammation. In addition endothelium-bound CCN1 sustains the adequate patrolling of Ly6C(low) monocytes both in the steady state and under inflammatory conditions. Blocking CCN1 or platelets with specific antibodies impaired the early arrival of Ly6C(low) monocytes and abolished the recruitment of neutrophils. These results refine the leukocyte recruitment cascade model by introducing endothelium-bound CCN1 as an inflammation mediator and by demonstrating a role for platelets and patrolling Ly6C(low) monocytes in acute vascular inflammation. ;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
1590;11054411;PRH represses transcription in hematopoietic cells by at least two independent mechanisms.;PRH (proline-rich homeodomain protein) is strongly expressed in the hematopoietic compartment. Here we show that PRH is a repressor of transcription in hematopoietic cells. A fragment of PRH that includes the homeodomain can bind to TATA box sequences in vitro and can also bind to the TATA box-binding protein. PRH represses transcription from TATA box-containing promoters in intact cells but does not repress transcription from a promoter lacking a TATA box. A mutation in the PRH homeodomain that blocks binding to DNA but that has little or no effect on binding to the TATA box-binding protein significantly reduces the ability of the protein to repress transcription and provides the first clear demonstration that a homeodomain can bring about transcriptional repression in vivo by binding to a TATA box. However, we also show that mutation of the PRH homeodomain does not block the ability of PRH to repress transcription when this protein is tethered upstream of the TATA box via a heterologous DNA-binding domain. PRH also contains an N-terminal proline-rich repression domain that is separate from the homeodomain. Deletion mapping suggests that this repression domain contains at least two regions that both independently contribute to transcriptional repression. ;polyproline;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
1592;2312159;A human fetal monoclonal DNA-binding antibody shares idiotypes with fetal and adult murine monoclonal DNA-binding antibodies.;A human DNA-binding monoclonal antibody was produced by fusing the hepatocytes from a 12-week-old human fetus with the lymphoblastoid cell line GM 4672 using polyethylene glycol. This antibody, designated BEG 2, binds to single-stranded (ss) DNA but also binds to double-stranded (ds) DNA, poly(dT), polyI and poly(ADP-ribose), but not to RNA, cardiolipin or K-30. The binding of BEG 2 to these polynucleotides can be inhibited by incubation with polynucleotides in the fluid phase. A rabbit polyclonal anti-idiotype was raised, and using this reagent it was shown that the BEG 2 idiotype is present in normal human serum (7%), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) sera (8%) and rheumatoid arthritis sera (23%). The extent of idiotypic sharing between BEG 2 and murine monoclonal DNA-binding antibodies, in particular monoclonal antibody (mAb) 423 (derived from a 15-day-old fetal MRL/Mp-lpr/lpr mouse) and mAb 402 (derived from an adult MRL/lpr mouse), was also investigated. Using a competition ELISA, it was shown that preincubation of BEG 2 with rabbit anti-423 and rabbit anti-402 inhibits the binding of BEG 2 to DNA, and the binding of 402 to DNA by anti-BEG 2 and anti-423. These data suggest that mAb BEG 2, 423 and 402 share common idiotypes, that autoreactivity is present in early fetal life, and that autoantibodies may be encoded for by germline genes, which have been conserved through evolution.;polyisoleucine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

TM-906 inhibited the contractile responses to cholinergic nerve stimulation (5 Hz) and to acetylcholine (3 X 10(-8) g/ml) to the same extent, both of which produced much the same amplitude of contraction. TM-906 noncompetitively antagonized the contractile response to methacholine, and it caused a parallel shift of dose-response curves for the contractile response to CaCl2 to higher concentrations. Moreover, TM-906 inhibited the contractile response to 50 mM KCl in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, TM-906 itself evoked a slight contractile response in a dose-dependent manner. The contractile response induced by TM-906 was prevented by exposure to Ca++-free solution, but not by tetrodotoxin or atropine. From these results, it was suggested that TM-906 inhibited the contractile responses to cholinergic nerve stimulation, acetylcholine, methacholine and 50 mM KCl by reducing the influx of calcium ion across the cell membrane, while it was assumed that TM-906 itself evoked a slight contractile response by increasing in some way the concentration of the intracellular free calcium ion available for the contractile systems.;-;-;-;hard_0
1595;28748179;Structure-Activity Relationships of Insect Defensins.;Insects make up the largest and most diverse group of organisms on earth with several million species to exist in total. Considering the sheer number of insect species and the vast variety of ways they interact with their environment through chemistry, it is clear that they have significant potential as a source of new lead molecules. They have adapted to a range of ecological habitats and exhibit a symbiotic lifestyle with various microbes such as bacteria and fungi. Accordingly, numerous antimicrobial compounds have been identified including for example defensin peptides. Insect defensins were found to have broad-spectrum activity against various gram-positive/negative bacteria as well as fungi. They exhibit a unique structural topology involving the complex arrangement of three disulfide bonds as well as an alpha helix and beta sheets, which is known as cysteine-stabilized αβ motif. Their stability and amenability to peptide engineering make them promising candidates for the development of novel antibiotics lead molecules. This review highlights the current knowledge regarding the structure-activity relationships of insect defensin peptides and provides basis for future studies focusing on the rational design of novel cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides. ;polycysteine;helix;-;LCR_with_function

Therapeutically, effective concentrations of 100 ng/ml were achieved within 20 min and lasted up to a maximum of 15.6 h. The decline of concentrations below this value thereafter, guarantees the absence of tolerance development in chronic therapy. In a three-period change-over study, two other commercial SR preparations exhibited only 79% and 53% of the bioavailability of the new formulation, which was significant in both cases. Compared with literature data, the absolute bioavailability of the new form should lie in the order of at least 85%.;-;-;-;hard_0
1600;7698229;The murine nucleolin protein is an inducible DNA and ATP binding protein which is readily detected in nuclear extracts of lipopolysaccharide-treated splenocytes.;A 100-kDa DNA binding protein was found to be dramatically up-regulated upon the mitogenic stimulation of murine splenocytes with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The induced DNA binding protein was also found to exhibit moderate binding specificity for the immunoglobulin isotype switch DNA repeats. Furthermore, the induction of the 100-kDa protein by LPS was found to be mediated by both an increase in the protein's stability and an increase in the synthesis of the protein. In vitro phosphorylation experiments revealed that the 100-kDa DNA binding protein was one of the most heavily phosphorylated proteins in both lymphoid and nonlymphoid nuclear extracts. Although this in vitro phosphorylation initially appeared to be mediated by a potent nuclear kinase activity, it was later determined that a significant part of the detected labeling was due to the direct binding of ATP by the 100-kDa protein. Antibodies raised to the 100-kDa DNA binding protein were used to isolate cDNA clones from a lymphocyte cDNA lambda gt11 expression library. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the cloned cDNAs were identical to the mouse nucleolin gene. The beta-galactosidase fusion proteins (encoded by exons 3-14 of nucleolin) and a more severely truncated 45-kDa protein (encoded by exons 5-14 of nucleolin) were both found to bind strongly to DNA and ATP. Furthermore, the strength of DNA binding was found to be highly dependent on the overall dG content of the DNA probes. Our experiments also revealed that apart from binding ATP and G-rich DNA, nucleolin directly bound GTP, dATP, and dGTP, but not dCTP, dTTP, or dUTP. Computer analysis revealed that the putative ATP binding domains appear to fall within two of the phylogenetically conserved RNA binding domains of nucleolin. ;polyglycine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
1605;16263756;The structure and location of SIMP/STT3B account for its prominent imprint on the MHC I immunopeptidome.;Proteins show drastic discrepancies in their contribution to the collection of self-peptides that shape the repertoire of CD8 T cells (MHC I self-immunopeptidome). To decipher why selected proteins are the foremost sources of MHC I-associated self-peptides, we chose to study SIMP/STT3B because this protein generates very high amounts of MHC I-associated peptides in mice and humans. We show that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation pathway and MHC I processing intersect at SIMP/STT3B. Relevant key features of SIMP/STT3B are its lysine-rich region, its propensity to misfold and its location in the ER membrane in close proximity to the immunoproteasome. Moreover, we show that coupling to SIMP/STT3B can be used to foster MHC I presentation of a selected peptide, here the ovalbumin peptide SIINFEKL. These data yield novel insights into relations between the cell proteome and the MHC I immunopeptidome. They suggest that the contribution of a given protein to the MHC I immunopeptidome results from the interplay of at least three factors: the presence of degrons (degradation signals), the tendency of the protein to misfold and its subcellular localization. Furthermore, they indicate that substrates of the ER-associated degradation pathway may have a prominent imprint on the MHC I self-immunopeptidome. ;polylysine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
1608;10611500;Survival and process regrowth of purified chick retinal ganglion cells cultured in a growth factor lacking medium at low density. Modulation by extracellular matrix proteins.;"Panning-purified retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) were cultured at low density in a chemical-defined growth factor (GF)-lacking medium on substrate of different extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. The process regrowth under these severe conditions were evaluated by morphometric measurements and by cell ELISA (CELISA) performed for neurofilaments regardless of their phosphorylated state (NF-CELISA), or for phosphorylated neurofilaments (PNF-CELISA), to respectively assess process regrowth or axonal development. The development obtained in cultures performed on laminin was taken as standard to refer the other substrata. The cellular content of Thy-1 required for panning purification as well as the gangliotetraosylganglioside (GTOG) expression and the lack of the immunolabeling of the RA4 antigen strongly suggest that the purified RGCs were mature neurons. About 80% of the 7-day-old embryo (E7)-RGCs survived 4 days in culture on any substrate, including polylysine. Conversely, E10-RGCs in about 75% of cultures on polylysine did not survive for 4 days. E7-RGCs developed better on thrombospondin and vitronectin. E10-RGCs cultured on vitronectin grew better than on laminin; on thrombospondin and collagen, E10-RGCs grew like on laminin and on fibronectin they had a poor development. The values of PNF-CELISA obtained on vitronectin, collagen and fibronectin on E7-RGC cultures were significantly higher than on laminin, which are in agreement with the longer processes observed. The flavoridin disintegrin caused a dose-response inhibition on E7-RGC cultures on thrombospondin but not on laminin, suggesting on process regrowth, the integrin-thrombospondin interaction(s) are significantly involved, while on laminin, it is the non-integrin receptor(s) which are significant involved.

1611;24055449;Single-stranded DNA aptamer that specifically binds to the influenza virus NS1 protein suppresses interferon antagonism.;Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of the influenza A virus (IAV) inhibits the host's innate immune response by suppressing the induction of interferons (IFNs). Therefore, blocking NS1 activity can be a potential strategy in the development of antiviral agents against IAV infection. In the present study, we selected a single-stranded DNA aptamer specific to the IAV NS1 protein after 15 cycles of systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) procedure and examined the ability of the selected aptamer to inhibit the function of NS1. The selected aptamer binds to NS1 with a Kd of 18.91±3.95nM and RNA binding domain of NS1 is determined to be critical for the aptamer binding. The aptamer has a G-rich sequence in the random sequence region and forms a G-quadruplex structure. The localization of the aptamer bound to NS1 in cells was determined by confocal images, and flow cytometry analysis further demonstrated that the selected aptamer binds specifically to NS1. In addition, luciferase reporter gene assay, quantitative RT-PCR, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) experiments demonstrated that the selected aptamer had the ability to induce IFN-β by suppressing the function of NS1. Importantly, we also found that the selected aptamer was able to inhibit the viral replication without affecting cell viability. These results indicate that the selected ssDNA aptamer has strong potential to be further developed as a therapeutic agent against IAV.  ;polyglycine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
1613;26121669;Kinetoplastid Specific RNA-Protein Interactions in Trypanosoma cruzi Ribosome Biogenesis.;RNA binding proteins (RBP) play essential roles in the highly conserved and coordinated process of ribosome biogenesis. Our laboratory has previously characterized two essential and abundant RBPs, P34 and P37, in Trypanosoma brucei which are required for several critical steps in ribosome biogenesis. The genes for these proteins have only been identified in kinetoplastid organisms but not in the host genome. We have identified a homolog of the TbP34 and TbP37 in a T. cruzi strain (termed TcP37/NRBD). Although the N-terminal APK-rich domain and RNA recognition motifs are conserved, the C-terminal region which contains putative nuclear and nucleolar localization signals in TbP34 and TbP37 is almost entirely missing from TcP37/NRBD. We have shown that TcP37/NRBD is expressed in T. cruzi epimastigotes at the level of mature mRNA and protein. Despite the loss of the C-terminal domain, TcP37/NRBD is present in the nucleus, including the nucleolus, and the cytoplasm. TcP37/NRBD interacts directly with Tc 5S rRNA, but does not associate with polyadenylated RNA. TcP37/NRBD also associates in vivo and in vitro with large ribosomal protein TcL5 and, unlike the case of T. brucei, this association is strongly enhanced by the presence of 5S rRNA, suggesting that the loss of the C-terminal domain of TcP37/NRBD may alter the interactions within the complex. These results indicate that the unique preribosomal complex comprised of L5, 5S rRNA, and the trypanosome-specific TcP37/NRBD or TbP34 and TbP37 is functionally conserved in trypanosomes despite the differences in the C-termini of the trypanosome-specific protein components.  ;polylysine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Microbiologic diagnosis of many of these cases was hindered by delayed presentation for care and by prior antibiotic therapy. In a retrospective investigation, we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to measure antibody titers to components of anthrax edema toxin (edema factor [EF] and protective antigen [PA]), lethal toxin (lethal factor [LF] and PA), and poly-D-glutamic acid capsule. Electrophoretic-immunotransblots (EITB, Western blot) were used to detect antibodies to PA and LF. Nine patients with cutaneous anthrax, 10 patients with oral-oropharyngeal anthrax, and 43 healthy unexposed Thai control villagers were studied. Over all, EITB was positive in 13/18 patients (sensitivity 72%) and 0/43 controls (specificity 100%). The sensitivity of the ELISA was 72% for PA, 42% for LF, 26% for EF, and 95-100% for capsule. Although a few control sera had apparent false positive titers to PA, the specificity of the ELISA confirmed by EITB (100%) demonstrated the applicability of these tests for the diagnosis of anthrax. ;polyaspartic;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

1628;33231687;The expression of Rpb10, a small subunit common to RNA polymerases, is modulated by the R3H domain-containing Rbs1 protein and the Upf1 helicase.;The biogenesis of eukaryotic RNA polymerases is poorly understood. The present study used a combination of genetic and molecular approaches to explore the assembly of RNA polymerase III (Pol III) in yeast. We identified a regulatory link between Rbs1, a Pol III assembly factor, and Rpb10, a small subunit that is common to three RNA polymerases. Overexpression of Rbs1 increased the abundance of both RPB10 mRNA and the Rpb10 protein, which correlated with suppression of Pol III assembly defects. Rbs1 is a poly(A)mRNA-binding protein and mutational analysis identified R3H domain to be required for mRNA interactions and genetic enhancement of Pol III biogenesis. Rbs1 also binds to Upf1 protein, a key component in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) and levels of RPB10 mRNA were increased in a upf1Δ strain. Genome-wide RNA binding by Rbs1 was characterized by UV cross-linking based approach. We demonstrated that Rbs1 directly binds to the 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of many mRNAs including transcripts encoding Pol III subunits, Rpb10 and Rpc19. We propose that Rbs1 functions by opposing mRNA degradation, at least in part mediated by NMD pathway. Orthologues of Rbs1 protein are present in other eukaryotes, including humans, suggesting that this is a conserved regulatory mechanism.;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
1631;17950909;PARP-1 activation in the ERK signaling pathway.;PARP-1 is a highly conserved DNA-binding protein, the most abundant member of the polyADP-ribose polymerases (PARP) family, which catalyzes post-translational modification of proteins by polyADP-ribosylation. This modification affects protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. Binding of PARP-1 to breakages in damaged DNA causes its activation and auto-polyADP-ribosylation in a process that is pivotal for DNA repair. Our recent findings outlined an alternative mechanism of PARP-1 activation via a direct interaction with phosphorylated ERK2 (externally regulated kinase), which is unrelated to DNA damage and does not involve PARP-1 binding to DNA. Furthermore, ERK2-induced PARP-1 activation dramatically amplifies ERK-signals, enhancing ERK-induced phosphorylation of the transcription factor Elk1 and enhancing core histone acetylation and expression of the Elk1 target gene, c-fos. Thus, PARP-1 activation in the ERK signaling pathway mediates epigenetic mechanisms promoting growth, proliferation and differentiation regulated by the Raf-MEK-ERK phosphorylation cascade. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
1632;35053093;Presence of a Mitovirus Is Associated with Alteration of the Mitochondrial Proteome, as Revealed by Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) and Co-Expression Network Models in Chenopodium quinoa Plants.;"Plant mitoviruses belong to Mitoviridae family and consist of positive single-stranded RNA genomes replicating exclusively in host mitochondria. We previously reported the biological characterization of a replicating plant mitovirus, designated Chenopodium quinoa mitovirus 1 (CqMV1), in some Chenopodium quinoa accessions. In this study, we analyzed the mitochondrial proteome from leaves of quinoa, infected and not infected by CqMV1. Furthermore, by protein-protein interaction and co-expression network models, we provided a system perspective of how CqMV1 affects mitochondrial functionality. We found that CqMV1 is associated with changes in mitochondrial protein expression in a mild but well-defined way. In quinoa-infected plants, we observed up-regulation of functional modules involved in amino acid catabolism, mitochondrial respiratory chain, proteolysis, folding/stress response and redox homeostasis. In this context, some proteins, including BCE2 (lipoamide acyltransferase component of branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex), DELTA-OAT (ornithine aminotransferase) and GR-RBP2 (glycine-rich RNA-binding protein 2) were interesting because all up-regulated and network hubs in infected plants; together with other hubs, including CAT (catalase) and APX3 (L-ascorbate peroxidase 3), they play a role in stress response and redox homeostasis. These proteins could be related to the higher tolerance degree to drought we observed in CqMV1-infected plants.

1637;26870818;Adjuvant-enhanced CD4 T Cell Responses are Critical to Durable Vaccine Immunity.;Protein-based vaccines offer a safer alternative to live-attenuated or inactivated vaccines but have limited immunogenicity. The identification of adjuvants that augment immunogenicity, specifically in a manner that is durable and antigen-specific, is therefore critical for advanced development. In this study, we use the filovirus virus-like particle (VLP) as a model protein-based vaccine in order to evaluate the impact of four candidate vaccine adjuvants on enhancing long term protection from Ebola virus challenge. Adjuvants tested include poly-ICLC (Hiltonol), MPLA, CpG 2395, and alhydrogel. We compared and contrasted antibody responses, neutralizing antibody responses, effector T cell responses, and T follicular helper (Tfh) cell frequencies with each adjuvant's impact on durable protection. We demonstrate that in this system, the most effective adjuvant elicits a Th1-skewed antibody response and strong CD4 T cell responses, including an increase in Tfh frequency. Using immune-deficient animals and adoptive transfer of serum and cells from vaccinated animals into naïve animals, we further demonstrate that serum and CD4 T cells play a critical role in conferring protection within effective vaccination regimens. These studies inform on the requirements of long term immune protection, which can potentially be used to guide screening of clinical-grade adjuvants for vaccine clinical development.  ;polyisoleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

Monocyte-derived DCs from PCa patients were matured using the ""standard"" cytokine cocktail (IL-1β/TNFα/IL-6/PGE₂) or using the αDC1-polarizing cocktail (IL-1β/TNFα/IFNα/IFNγ/poly-I:C), loaded with UV-irradiated LNCaP cells, and used to sensitize autologous CD8(+) T cells. αDC1s from PCa patients secreted 10-30 times higher levels of IL-12p70 than sDCs. Importantly this elevated capacity for IL-12p70 secretion was not inhibited by loading with apoptotic tumor cells. Compared to standard DCs, αDC1s induced higher numbers of CD8(+) T cells capable of recognizing both the original PCa cells as well as another PCa cell line, DU145, in MHC class I-restricted fashion. Furthermore, αDC1s induced higher numbers of CD8(+) T cells recognizing defined PCa-specific class I-restricted peptide epitopes of prostate-specific antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase: PAP(135-143) (average 49-fold higher), PAP(112-120) (average 24-fold), PSA(141-150) (average 5.5-fold), and PSA(146-154) (average 11-fold). Type-1 polarization of GM-CSF/IL-4-generated DCs enhances their ability to present allogeneic tumor cells and to induce CD8(+) T cells recognizing different PCa cells and multiple defined PCa-specific epitopes. These observations help to develop improved immunotherapies of PCa for patients with different HLA types and lacking autologous tumor material. ";polyisoleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
1642;24626991;LETM1 haploinsufficiency causes mitochondrial defects in cells from humans with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome: implications for dissecting the underlying pathomechanisms in this condition.;"Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) represents an archetypical example of a contiguous gene deletion disorder - a condition comprising a complex set of developmental phenotypes with a multigenic origin. Epileptic seizures, intellectual disability, growth restriction, motor delay and hypotonia are major co-morbidities in WHS. Haploinsufficiency of LETM1, which encodes a mitochondrial inner-membrane protein functioning in ion transport, has been proposed as an underlying pathomechanism, principally for seizures but also for other core features of WHS, including growth and motor delay. Growing evidence derived from several model organisms suggests that reduced LETM1 expression is associated with some element of mitochondrial dysfunction. Surprisingly, LETM1-dependent mitochondrial functional deficits have not previously been described in cells from individuals with WHS. Here, using a unique panel of WHS-patient-derived cell lines with deletions of differing sizes, incorporating LETM1 or not, we show, for the first time, that LETM1 expression is reduced in mitochondria isolated from WHS-patient cells. Furthermore, we show that this is associated with distinct mitochondrial phenotypes, including altered intracellular [Ca(2+)] levels, dysfunctional mitochondrial transition-pore opening, hyperpolarization and superoxide leakage from resting mitochondria. Interestingly, we find that these phenotypes segregate with seizures in our WHS cohort. Our findings identify novel cellular phenotypes in WHS attributable to a 50% reduction in LETM1 expression level; these phenotypes could underlie and/or contribute to some of the core clinical features of this condition.";-;-;-;hard_0
1643;7973892;Southern adolescents: a survey of attitudes and beliefs about smoking.;Using data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics, we examined the relationships between smoking-related beliefs and attitudes and smoking status for a sample of adolescents (N = 3,198) from southern states. Stepwise logistic regression was used to identify the best predictors of smoking prevalence. Results indicated that 8 of 13 variables in the logistic model significantly differentiated between smokers and nonsmokers. Smokers were more likely to believe that it is safe to smoke for only a year or 2 and that smoking helps reduce stress and boredom while promoting relaxation. Smokers also reported a higher tolerance than nonsmokers for being around other smokers, and reported their parents would not mind their smoking. The logistic model attained a predictive accuracy of 93.2%. The implication of these findings is that if smoking interventions targeted at adolescents address smoking-related beliefs and attitudes, there is an enhanced likelihood that such interventions will positively influence the smoking behavior of southern adolescents.;-;-;-;hard_0
1647;32440474;"Small Protein Hidden in lncRNA LOC90024 Promotes ""Cancerous"" RNA Splicing and Tumorigenesis.";"Conventional therapies for late-stage colorectal cancer (CRC) have limited effects because of chemoresistance, recurrence, and metastasis. The ""hidden"" proteins/peptides encoded by long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) may be a novel resource bank for therapeutic options for patients with cancer. Here, lncRNA LOC90024 is discovered to encode a small 130-amino acid protein that interacts with several splicing regulators, such as serine- and arginine-rich splicing factor 3 (SRSF3), to regulate mRNA splicing, and the protein thus is named ""Splicing Regulatory Small Protein"" (SRSP). SRSP, but not LOC90024 lncRNA itself, promotes CRC tumorigenesis and progression, while silencing of SRSP suppresses CRC tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, SRSP increases the binding of SRSF3 to exon 3 of transcription factor Sp4, resulting in the inclusion of Sp4 exon 3 to induce the formation of the ""cancerous"" long Sp4 isoform (L-Sp4 protein) and inhibit the formation of the ""noncancerous"" short Sp4 isoform (S-Sp4 peptide), which lacks the transactivation domain. The upregulated SRSP level is positively associated with malignant phenotypes and poor prognosis in patients with CRC. Collectively, the findings uncover that a lncRNA-encoded small protein SRSP induces ""cancerous"" Sp4 splicing variant formation and may be a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for patients with CRC.";polyarginine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
1649;9039225;Major glossectomy: end results of 106 cases.;Advanced cancers of the oral cavity continue to be a therapeutic challenge. Despite significant improvements in radiotherapeutic techniques and adjuvant chemotherapy, patients usually die after a short period. Recent progress in reconstructive techniques has made major glossectomy (subtotal, near total, total or extended total) a reasonable palliative and potentially curative approach. It is the purpose of this study to report a series of 106 patients treated from 1985 to 1994 regarding surgical complications and prognosis. All but 1 patient undergoing major glossectomy had squamous cell carcinoma. Primary tumour sites were oral tongue (50 cases), base of the tongue (18 cases), floor of the mouth (28 cases) and other parts of the mouth (10 cases). Tumour stages were: 25 T3, 57 T4, 24 Tx, 34 N0, 20 N1, 32 N2a-N3, 20 Nx. The types of glossectomy were as follows: 24 subtotal, 31 near total and 51 total. A total laryngectomy was performed in only 6 cases. A neck dissection was performed in all but 3 patients: 12 unilateral radical neck dissection (RND), 1 unilateral supra, omohyoid (SOH), 39 simultaneous bilateral RND, 8 simultaneous bilateral SOH, and 43 RND associated to contralateral SOH. A pectoralis major myocutaneous flap was used to repair the operative defect in 96 cases. Complications were seen in 52 cases (49%). The most common complications were wound infection (17 cases), flap necrosis (15 cases) and fistula (15 cases). Significant transient aspiration was seen in 8 patients. At the study closing date, 30 patients were alive without disease, 5 had recurrent disease, 47 died of cancer, 14 died of causes not related to cancer or treatment and 10 were lost to follow-up. The 5-year actuarial survival rates were, respectively, 45%, 18% and 18% for T3, T4 and Tx. Other significant variables were pN stage (P = 0.0672) and year of admission (0.0318). In conclusion a major glossectomy without laryngectomy whenever possible is a safe procedure for a selected group of patients with advanced tongue and floor of the mouth cancer. The actuarial survival rates presented suggests that, in a very select group of patients, major glossectomy is a surgical procedure to be considered.;-;-;-;hard_0
1650;4346879;Alteration of the relative stability of dA-dT and dG-dC base pairs in DNA.;"Several small alkylammonium ions can eliminate, or even reverse, the usual dependence of the DNA transition temperature on base composition. For example, in 3 M tetramethylammonium chloride, or 2.4 M tetraethylammonium chloride, DNAs of different base compositions all melt at a common temperature, and with a greatly decreased breadth of transition reflecting only the sequence-independent components of melting cooperativity. At still higher concentrations of such additives, dG.dC-rich DNAs melt at lower temperatures than dA.dT-rich molecules. Circular dichroism spectra show that these additives alter the structure of the DNA double helix very little at room temperature. This differential (base-specific) effect on helix stability is investigated with several small additives related to the tetraalkylammonium ions. Additives larger than tetraethylammonium ion have little differential effect on helix stability. Preferential binding of ions to dA.dT base pairs, requiring fit into a ""groove"" of DNA, is consistent with these data and with equilibrium binding studies. These differential effects can be distinguished from general destabilizing effects, which are independent of specific features of macromolecular conformation or chemistry. Possible experimental uses of this ability to alter the base-composition-dependent components of the stability of the DNA helix are discussed, as well as the insight this phenomenon provides into the molecular basis for the differential stability of dA.dT and dG.dC base pairs.

1653;8609543;Genetic aspects of methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and methods used for its detection in clinical laboratories in the United States.;The mecA gene in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) directs production of a novel penicillin-binding protein (PBP 2A), an enzyme active in cell wall synthesis. MecA, alone, however, does not determine the degree of resistance expressed by strains of MRSA. Differential resistance or variations in other genes that participate in cell wall synthesis, such as laboratory mutant fem genes, may account, in part, for the heterogeneity of methicillin resistance expression in MRSA. The exact mechanisms of methicillin resistance expression in clinical isolates remain to be elucidated. Laboratories use selective agars containing oxacillin and turbidity pattern recognition programs in automated instruments to identify MRSA, although not all mecA-containing strains are detected.

1654;18039683;Quantitative analysis of CUG-BP1 binding to RNA repeats.;CUG-binding protein 1 (CUG-BP1) is a member of the CUG-BP1 and ETR-3-like factors (CELF) family of RNA-binding proteins, and is involved in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Several mRNA targets of CUG-BP1 have been identified, including the insulin receptor, muscle chloride channel, and cardiac troponin T. On the other hand, CUG-BP1 has only a weak affinity for CUG repeats. We conducted quantitative-binding assays to assess CUG-BP1 affinities for several repeat RNAs by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Although we detected interactions between CUG-BP1 and CUG repeats, other UG-rich sequences actually showed stronger interactions. Binding constants of CUG-BP1 for RNAs indicated that the affinity for UG repeats was far stronger than for CUG repeats. We also found that N-terminal deletion mutant of CUG-BP1 has UG repeat-binding activity in a yeast three-hybrid system, although C-terminal deletion mutant does not. Our data indicates that CUG-BP1 specifically recognized UG repeats, probably through cooperative binding of RNA recognition motifs at both ends of the protein. This is the first report of a binding constant for CUG-BP1 calculated in vitro. ;polyglycine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

1657;18445631;Insights into anti-termination regulation of the hut operon in Bacillus subtilis: importance of the dual RNA-binding surfaces of HutP.;The anti-termination protein, HutP, regulates the gene expression of the hut (histidine utilization) operon of Bacillus subtilis, by destabilizing the hut terminator RNA located upstream of the coding region encoding l-histidine degradation enzymes. On the basis of biochemical, in vivo and X-ray structural analyses, we now report that HutP uses its dual RNA-binding surfaces to access two XAG-rich regions (sites I and II) within the terminator RNA to mediate the destabilization process. In this process, HutP initiates destabilization at the 5'-end of its mRNA by binding to the first XAG-rich region (site I) and then accesses the second XAG-rich region (site II), located downstream of the stable G-C-rich segment of the terminator stem. By this action, HutP appears to disrupt the G-C-rich terminator stem, and thus prevents premature termination of transcription in the RNA segment preceding the regions encoding for the histidine degradation enzymes. ;polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Alteration of the blood-brain barrier and activation of neuroinflammation seem to play an important role in AD neurodegeneration, especially in the decrease of Aß peptide clearance, therefore suggesting a role of infectious agents. Epidemiological and experimental studies on cellular or murine models related to herpes simplex virus (HSV), spirochetes, Chlamydia pneumoniae or Borrelia, and systemic inflammation are reviewed. Aß peptide or tau protein could also behave like a prion protein. Infectious agents could thus have an impact on AD by direct interaction with neurotropism or systemic inflammation.

1663;9765261;An extended alpha-helix and specific amino acid residues opposite the DNA-binding surface of the cAMP response element binding protein basic domain are important for human T cell lymphotropic retrovirus type I Tax binding.;The human T cell lymphotropic retrovirus type I (HTLV-I) trans-activator, Tax, interacts specifically with the basic-domain/leucine-zipper (bZip) protein, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), bound to the viral Tax-responsive element consisting of three imperfect 21-base pair repeats, each with a cAMP response element core flanked by G/C-rich sequences. Here, the minimal CREB-bZip necessary for Tax binding is shown to be composed of amino acid residues 280-341. The Tax-CREB interaction involves an uninterrupted and extended alpha-helix in CREB that spans most of its basic domain to include amino acid residues localized to the NH2 terminus of the DNA binding region. Mutational analyses indicate that three residues, Arg284, Met291, and Glu299 unique to this region of the CREB/activating transcription factor-1 subfamily of bZip proteins, constitute the contact surface for Tax. Amino acid substitutions in these positions had little impact on CREB-bZip binding to DNA but abrogated its binding to Tax. Each of the contact residues for Tax are spaced approximately two helical turns apart on the side of the bZip helix directly opposite to that of the invariant DNA-binding residues. Molecular modeling reveals the Tax-contact residues to be near the minor groove of the G/C-rich DNA in the 21-base pair repeat. They most likely position Tax for minor groove contact with the G/C-rich sequences.;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

1668;12692263;E2FBP1/DRIL1, an AT-rich interaction domain-family transcription factor, is regulated by p53.;E2FBP1/DRIL1 is an AT-rich interaction domain DNA-binding protein and is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues. It has been shown that Bright, the mouse orthologue of E2FBP1/DRIL1, exhibits sequence-specific DNA binding and regulates immunoglobulin transcription. Here we show a novel connection between E2FBP1/DRIL1 and the p53 tumor suppressor, a key regulator of growth arrest or apoptosis in response to cellular stress. We found a putative p53-binding site, which specifically responded to p53, in the second intron of the E2FBP1/DRIL1 gene. E2FBP1/DRIL1was induced by p53 and up-regulated following DNA damage caused by UV radiation or doxorubicin treatment in a manner dependent on endogenous p53. The ectopic expression of E2FBP1/DRIL1 induced growth arrest in U2OS cells expressing normal p53, but not Saos-2 cells lacking p53. These results suggest that E2FBP1/DRIL1 may play a role in growth suppression mediated by p53. ;polythreonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
1670;10400790;Retrovirus targeting by tropism restriction to melanoma cells.;Targeted vectors will be necessary for many gene therapy applications. To target retroviruses to melanomas, we fused a single-chain variable fragment antibody (scFv) directed against the surface glycoprotein high-molecular-weight melanoma-associated antigen (HMW-MAA) to the amphotropic murine leukemia virus envelope. A proline-rich hinge and matrix metalloprotease (MMP) cleavage site linked the two proteins. The modified viruses bound only to HMW-MAA-expressing cells, as inclusion of the proline-rich hinge prevented viral binding to the amphotropic viral receptor. Following attachment to HMW-MAA, MMP cleavage of the envelope at the melanoma cell surface removed the scFv and proline-rich hinge, allowing infection. Complexing of targeted retroviruses with 2, 3-dioleoyloxy-N-[2(spermine-carboxamido)ethyl]N, N-dimethyl-1-propanaminium trifluoroacetate-dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine liposomes greatly increased their efficiency without affecting their target cell specificity. In a cell mixture, 40% of HMW-MAA-positive cells but less than 0.01% of HMW-MAA-negative cells were infected. This approach can therefore produce efficient, targeted retroviruses suitable for in vivo gene delivery and should allow specific gene delivery to many human cell types by inclusion of different scFv and protease combinations. ;polyproline;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

We identified recurrently mutated genes in CRC, such as BCL9L, RBM10, CTCF, and KLF5, that were not previously appreciated in this disease. Furthermore, we investigated the genomic correlates of immune-cell infiltration and found that higher neoantigen load was positively associated with overall lymphocytic infiltration, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), memory T cells, and CRC-specific survival. The association with TILs was evident even within microsatellite-stable tumors. We also found positive selection of mutations in HLA genes and other components of the antigen-processing machinery in TIL-rich tumors. These results may inform immunotherapeutic approaches in CRC. More generally, this study demonstrates a framework for future integrative molecular epidemiology research in colorectal and other malignancies. ;polyleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
1675;7559627;Functional analyses of the transcription factor Sp4 reveal properties distinct from Sp1 and Sp3.;Sp4 is a human sequence-specific DNA binding protein with structural features similar to those described for the transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3. These three proteins contain two glutamine-rich regions and a highly conserved DNA binding domain composed of three zinc fingers. Consistently, Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 do have the same DNA binding specificities. In this report, we have embarked on a detailed analysis of the transcriptional properties of Sp4 in direct comparison to Sp1 and Sp3. Cotransfection experiments into Drosophila SL2 cells lacking endogenous Sp factors demonstrate that Sp4 is an activator protein like Sp1. However, in contrast to Sp1, Sp4 is not able to act synergistically through adjacent binding sites. The transactivation function of Sp4 resides, like that of Sp1, in the N-terminal glutamine-rich region. Sp4 can function as a target for the Sp1 activation domains in a superactivation assay, suggesting that the activation domains of Sp1 and Sp4 are functionally related. Furthermore, we show that Sp4-mediated transcriptional activation can be repressed by Sp3. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the transcription factor Sp4 exhibits specific functional properties distinct from Sp1 and Sp3. ;polyglutamine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

The cloned tiMTF-1L has the characteristics of all of the tiMTF-1S identified so far with the zinc finger domain having six fingers, the acidic-rich, proline-rich, and serine/threonine-rich domains; however, the short form encodes for the zinc finger domain with five zinc fingers only and no other domains. The transient transfection of tiMTF-1L into human HepG2 cells showed both constitutive and zinc-induced metal-responsive-element (MRE)-driven reporter gene expression. However, the transfection of tiMTF-1S (which lacks all three transactivation domains) into a human cell line showed reduced transcriptional activities compared with an endogenous control in both basal- and Zn(2+)-induced conditions. The tiMTF-1 isoforms were tagged with GFP and transfected into Hepa-T1 cells (tilapia hepatocytes). The nuclear translocation of tiMTF-1L was observed when the cells were exposed to a sufficient concentration of metals for 6h. However, tiMTF-1S, was localized in the nucleus with or without metal treatment.

PELA microspheres with entrapped Leptospira Interrogans antigens, outer membrane protein (OMP) were elaborated by solvent extraction method based on the formation of multiple w/o/w emulsion, and the resulting microspheres were characterized with respect to particle size, OMP entrapment and morphology characteristics. The purpose of the present study is to perform the optimization of preparative parameters for OMP-loaded PELA micropsheres to control particle size and improve the OMP encapsulation efficiency. Of all the parameters investigated, the polymer concentration of organic phase and the external aqueous phase volume play major roles on particle size, while the organic phase volume, internal aqueous phase volume and the addition of surfactant into the internal aqueous phase display considerable effects on OMP loading efficiency. A small volume of internal aqueous phase and intermediate volumes of organic phase and external aqueous phase were favorable to achieve micropsheres with a size of 1-2 microns and high antigen encapsulation efficiency (70-80%). In vitro OMP release profiles from PELA microspheres consist of a small burst release followed by a gradual release phase. The OMP release rate shows some relations with the porous and water-swollen inner structure of the microspheres matrix. The presence of surfactant in microspheres accelerates OMP release, but the OMP entrapment within microspheres shows limited effects on the release profile. ;polyaspartic;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
1679;9281349;A factor with a zinc- and phorbol ester-binding domain is necessary for endosome fusion.;An inhibitory effect of several zinc chelators on endosome fusion reconstituted in an in vitro system has been recently reported (A. Aballay et al., 1995, Biochem. J. 312, 919-923). The factor that requires zinc for its activity is still unknown. Since the regulatory domain of protein kinase C (PKC) contains cysteine-rich motifs which coordinate zinc, we suspected that PKC or a PKC-like protein might be that factor. To test this hypothesis, we studied the effect of calphostin C, a specific inhibitor of PKC that interacts with the cysteine-rich motif, and PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate), an activator of several PKC isoforms that bind to the same region, on endosome fusion. Calphostin C inhibited endosome fusion in a zinc-regulated manner, whereas PMA enhanced endosome fusion. Moreover, fusion was strongly stimulated when both PMA and zinc were added together to zinc-depleted fusion reactions. Inhibitors of the catalytic domain of PKC had no effect on the assay suggesting that the kinase activity is not required. In contrast, a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing a cysteine-rich region of the regulatory domain of PKCgamma inhibited endosome fusion in a PMA-dependent manner. Western blot analysis demonstrated the presence of proteins containing PKC-like cysteine-rich regions that are released from endosomal fractions by zinc chelators. These results indicate that the previously proposed zinc-dependent factor required for endosome fusion could be either a PKC isoform or a protein containing the phorbol ester-binding domain of PKC.;polycysteine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
1680;8930121;Bovine chromaffin cells in culture show carboxylesterase activities sensitive to organophosphorus compounds.;"Carboxylesterase activities are widely distributed in a great variety of tissues; however, the biological function of these enzymes remains unclear. Some organophosphorus compounds induce a neurodegenarative syndrome related to the covalent modification of a carboxylesterase known as neuropathy target esterase. We investigated the expression of neuropathy target esterase and related carboxylesterase in bovine chromaffin cells with the aim of developing a potential in vitro model for studying the cellular function of carboxylesterase enzymes and toxic effects of organophosphorus compounds. Total phenyl valerate esterase exhibited an activity of 1.27 +/- 0.19 mU/10(5) cells (SD, n = 15). From the phenyl valerate esterase paraoxon and mipafox inhibition curves the following activities have been determined: B-activity (resistant to 40 microM paraoxon), 1.05 +/- 0.08 mU/10(5) cells (n = 8); C-activity (resistant to 40 microM paraoxon plus 250 microM mipafox), 0.12 +/- 0.05 mU/10(5) cells (n = 8); and neuropathy target esterase, calculated by the difference between B- and C-activities, 0.93 +/- 0.08 mU/10(5) cells (n = 8). All of these activities increased linearly with the number of cells and time of incubation with the substrate. Most of the phenol product of the reaction was released and detected in the extracellular medium. None of the components of the reaction were shown to affect cell viability when assessed by trypan blue exclusion. The study shows that bovine chromaffin cells possess carboxylesterase activities and respond to inhibition by paraoxon and mipafox, thus facilitating the discrimination of neuropathy target esterase.

This study was undertaken to evaluate whether u-PA is significantly increased in carcinomatous pleural fluids compared to those due to other aetiologies, and to identify the cells in the pleural space that are involved in its accumulation. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we quantified u-PA in the pleural fluid specimens of 40 patients with carcinomatous pleuritis, 18 with tuberculosis, 18 with parapneumonic pleuritis and 11 with congestive heart failure (CHF). The level of u-PA was elevated in carcinomatous pleural fluid compared with the level in transudative pleural fluid from patients with CHF (p<0.0001). The levels of u-PA were not statistically different between patients with cancer and tuberculosis, or between patients with cancer and pneumonia. The levels of u-PA in patients who did not respond to chemical pleurodesis were significantly higher than those who had complete response (p=0.0001). In immunocytochemical and immunoblotting studies, cancer cells in pleural fluids as well as mesothelial cells contained u-PA. u-PA was detected in the culture supernatants of viable pleural cells in the majority of patients with carcinomatous pleuritis.

Here, we present a network of interactions that links dNab2 to cytoplasmic control of neuronal mRNAs in conjunction with the fragile X protein ortholog dFMRP. dNab2 and dfmr1 interact genetically in control of neurodevelopment and olfactory memory, and their encoded proteins co-localize in puncta within neuronal processes. dNab2 regulates CaMKII, but not futsch, implying a selective role in control of dFMRP-bound transcripts. Reciprocally, dFMRP and vertebrate FMRP restrict mRNA poly(A) tail length, similar to dNab2/ZC3H14. Parallel studies of murine hippocampal neurons indicate that ZC3H14 is also a cytoplasmic regulator of neuronal mRNAs. Altogether, these findings suggest that dNab2 represses expression of a subset of dFMRP-target mRNAs, which could underlie brain-specific defects in patients lacking ZC3H14. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

1692;18774771;Effective delivery of antisense peptide nucleic acid oligomers into cells by anthrax protective antigen.;Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) is highly stable and binds to complementary RNA and DNA with high affinity, but it resists cellular uptake, thereby limiting its bioavailability. We investigated whether protectiveantigen (PA, a non-toxic component of anthrax toxin) could transport antisense PNA oligomers into reporter cells that contain luciferase transgenes with mutant beta-globin IVS2 intronic inserts, which permit aberrant pre-mRNA splicing and impair luciferase expression. PNA oligomers antisense to mutant splice sites in these IVS2 inserts induced luciferase expression when effectively delivered into the cells. PNA 18-mers with C-terminal poly-lysine tails [PNA(Lys)(8)] demonstrated modest sequence-specific antisense activity by themselves at micromolar concentrations in luc-IVS2 reporter cell cultures. However, this activity was greatly amplified by PA. Antisense PNA(Lys)(8) with but not without PA also corrected the IVS2-654 beta-globin splice defect in cultured erythroid precursor cells from a patient with beta-thalassemia [genotype, IVS2-654(beta(0)/beta(E))], providing further evidence that anthrax PA can effectively transport antisense PNA oligomers into cells. ;polylysine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
1693;25609428;Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2-sensitive Na+/Ca2+ exchanger activity in dendritic cells.;Gene variants of the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are associated with susceptibility to Parkinson's disease (PD). Besides brain and periphery, LRRK2 is expressed in various immune cells including dendritic cells (DCs), antigen-presenting cells linking innate and adaptive immunity. However, the function of LRRK2 in the immune system is still incompletely understood. Here, Ca(2+)-signaling was analyzed in DCs isolated from gene-targeted mice lacking lrrk2 (Lrrk2(-/-)) and their wild-type littermates (Lrrk2(+/+)). According to Western blotting, Lrrk2 was expressed in Lrrk2(+/+) DCs but not in Lrrk2(-/-)DCs. Cytosolic Ca(2+) levels ([Ca(2+)]i) were determined utilizing Fura-2 fluorescence and whole cell currents to decipher electrogenic transport. The increase of [Ca(2+)]i following inhibition of sarcoendoplasmatic Ca(2+)-ATPase with thapsigargin (1 µM) in the absence of extracellular Ca(2+) (Ca(2+)-release) and the increase of [Ca(2+)]i following subsequent readdition of extracellular Ca(2+) (SOCE) were both significantly larger in Lrrk2(-/-) than in Lrrk2(+/+) DCs. The augmented increase of [Ca(2+)]i could have been due to impaired Ca(2+) extrusion by K(+)-independent (NCX) and/or K(+)-dependent (NCKX) Na(+)/Ca(2+)-exchanger activity, which was thus determined from the increase of [Ca(2+)]i, (Δ[Ca(2+)]i), and current following abrupt replacement of Na(+) containing (130 mM) and Ca(2+) free (0 mM) extracellular perfusate by Na(+) free (0 mM) and Ca(2+) containing (2 mM) extracellular perfusate. As a result, both slope and peak of Δ[Ca(2+)]i as well as Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger-induced current were significantly lower in Lrrk2(-/-) than in Lrrk2(+/+) DCs. A 6 or 24 hour treatment with the LRRK2 inhibitor GSK2578215A (1 µM) significantly decreased NCX1 and NCKX1 transcript levels, significantly blunted Na(+)/Ca(2+)-exchanger activity, and significantly augmented the increase of [Ca(2+)]i following Ca(2+)-release and SOCE. In conclusion, the present observations disclose a completely novel functional significance of LRRK2, i.e., the up-regulation of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger transcription and activity leading to attenuation of Ca(2+)-signals in DCs. ;polyleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
1694;8108136;Mechanism of expression and role in transcriptional control of the proto-oncogene NFKB-2/LYT-10.;The NFKB-2 gene (previously LYT-10, NF-kappa Bp100 or NF-kappa Bp97) codes for a NF-kappa B/rel related protein which is highly homologous to NFKB-1 (previously NF-kappa Bp105) within its rel, poly-glycine and ankyrin domains. The NFKB-2 gene is a candidate proto-oncogene since it is involved in lymphoma-associated chromosomal aberrations. In order to gain insight into the physiological function and role in tumorigenesis of NFKB-2, we have analysed its mechanism of expression and role in transcriptional regulation. We report that, contrary to previous studies, a single 3.2 kb mRNA species and its 100 kD (p100) primary translation product is detectable in all cell types tested. A second NFKB-2 protein, p52, corresponding to the amino-terminal half (rel domain) of NFKB-2 p100, is detectable in the same cell types and derives from the post-translational processing of p100. While p100 is constitutively localized in the cytoplasm, NF-kappa B induction by TPA treatment of Hela cells is associated with cytoplasmic/nuclear translocation of NFKB-2 p52 and its appearance within DNA-binding NF-kappa B complexes. NFKB-2 p52 differs from NFKB-1p50 in its differential affinity for kappa B sequences: by itself it binds H2/HLA-kappa B sites more efficiently than HIV/IgK-kappa B sites, while it can bind both sites efficiently when complexed with Rel-A(p65). Transient co-transfection of expression and reporter plasmids in cells devoid of endogenous NF-kappa B activity showed that p52 has no intrinsic transcriptional activation capabilities: it can stimulate Rel-A(p65)-driven transcription by formation of p65/p52 heterodimers, whereas, overexpressed, it down-regulates p65-dependent transcription by formation of inactive p52/p52 homodimers. These results indicate that the NFKB-2 gene codes for an inducible NF-kappa B transcription factor with the capability of differentially regulating NF-kappa B transcription depending on its abundance in the nucleus. ;polyglycine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
1695;9989124;Major depression and its response to sertraline in primary care vs. psychiatric office practice patients. Results of an open-label trial in Argentina.;Great strides have been achieved in recent years in the detection and treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in primary care settings. Little is known about the types or patients with MDD seen in primary care as compared with those seen in psychiatric office practice. Few studies have compared clinical outcomes after treatment with antidepressants in these two settings. In Argentina, the authors conducted an open-label treatment study of MDD patients in primary care (n = 469) and psychiatric office practice (n = 299). The patients were compared on baseline sociodemographic and clinical variables. These same patients were treated with sertraline 50-100 mg per day for 8 weeks. At baseline, the patients in psychiatric office practice were younger, more likely to abuse alcohol, less likely to have comorbid medical disorders, and more likely to have failed a prior treatment for depression during the current episode. The two groups did not differ significantly on depression severity or in depressive symptom profile on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham-D). After 8 weeks of treatment, mean Ham-D scores were reduced comparably in both groups, from about 25 to about 10. Rates of adverse events were 14%-29%, depending on the follow-up interval. Adherence with treatment was high in both groups (over 95%). The patients in primary care and psychiatry office practice are similar in several ways. Significant reductions in depressive symptoms are possible in both settings, in large numbers of patients, by using doses of sertraline in the 50-100 mg range.;-;-;-;hard_0
1696;34582528;The effect of polysaccharide-based hydrogels on the response of antigen-presenting cell lines to immunomodulators.;Hydrogel presents as foreign material to the host and participates in immune responses, which skew the biofunctions of immunologic loads (antigen and adjuvants) during in situ DC priming. This study aims to investigate the effect of the hydrogel made from different polysaccharides on macrophage (RAW264.7) activation and DC (JAWSII) modulation. We adopted polysaccharides of different sugar chemistry to fabricate hydrogels. Hyaluronate (HA), glycol chitosan (GC) and dextran (DX) were functionalized with vinyl sulfone and chemically cross-linked with dithiothreitol via thiol-click chemistry. We found that HA reduced macrophage adhesion and activation on the hydrogel surface. GC and DX promoted M1 polarization in terms of higher CCR7 expression and TNF-α, IL-6 production. In terms of DC engagement, GC promoted antigen uptake by JAWSII and all hydrogels promoted antigen presentation on MHC-I molecules. GC and DX favoured the generation of immunogenic DC while accommodating immunostimulatory functions of IFN-γ and polyI:C or LPS during co-incubation. Particularly, the co-incubation of IP with GC promoted CCR7 expression on JAWSII. Conversely, HA was more appropriate for the construction of a tolerogenic DC priming platform. We observed that HA did not induce co-stimulatory markers expression on DC but suppressed the action of LPS in inducing TNF-α generation. Moreover, when immunosuppressive cytokines, IL-10 and TGF-β were added, cytokines' immunosuppressive action was amplified by hydrogel bedding, HA, GC and to a less extent DX in suppressing LPS-induced IL-6 generation from JAWSII. We concluded that HA is preferable for tolerogenic DC development while minimizing the macrophage response in conferring foreign body response, whereas DX and GC are more appropriate for immunogenic DC development. This study demonstrates the potential of polysaccharides in conferring in situ DC priming together with antigen and adjuvant loads while addressing the tradeoff between the foreign body responses and DC engagement by selecting appropriate polysaccharides for the hydrogel platform construction.;polyisoleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

1698;12832122;Identification of the domains of the fibronectin-binding protein I of Streptococcus pyogenes responsible for adjuvanticity.;Intranasal administration of antigens coupled to full-length fibronectin-binding protein I (SfbI) of Streptococcus pyogenes results in the elicitation of improved humoral and cellular immune responses, at both systemic and mucosal levels. We want to evaluate if SfbI also exhibits adjuvant properties when co-administered with the antigen, as well as identify the minimal domain responsible for its adjuvanticity. To achieve this aim, mice were immunized by the intranasal route with the model antigen beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) co-administered with recombinant proteins spanning different portions of the SfbI protein. The obtained results demonstrated that the adjuvant properties of SfbI were maintained intact when admixed to the model antigen. Similar kinetics and absolute titers of beta-gal-specific IgG antibodies as well as a dominant IgG(1) isotype response pattern were observed using SfbI derivatives spanning either the aromatic and proline-rich (H10) or the fibronectin-binding (H12) domains, respectively. The use of all tested derivatives also stimulated the elicitation of efficient beta-gal-specific IgA responses in lung lavages (23-25% of the total IgA). The obtained results suggest that different sub-domains of the SfbI protein can be used as adjuvants for the development of mucosal vaccines. ;polyproline;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
1705;2843808;Enrichment and depletion of Hela topoisomerase I recognition sites among specific types of DNA elements.;The SDS-induced nicking of DNA helix by Hela topoisomerase I in vitro has been studied by using 2.9 kb of cloned human DNA as the substrate. The frequency of nicking is increased from 1/23 (nick/nt) to 1/19 (nick/nt) when camptothecin is present in the nicking reaction. The cytotoxic drug also induces DNA nicks without the addition of SDS. Although the consensus built from DNA sequences from -20 to +20 of more than one hundred of the nicking sites only shows a preference for T at position -1, the distributions of the topoisomerae I-cleavable sites among different categories of specific DNA sequences are apparently non- random. Long stretches of tandem (CA), A, or T residues, and the GC-rich promoter region of alpha 1 globin gene are all refractory to the nicking reaction. However, the nicking frequencies of short direct repeats flanking different Alu type sequences are as high as 1/6 (nick/nt). Finally, several tandemly arranged minirepeats of the form (TxAy)z, that are usually found at the 3' ends of the primate Alu family or Kpnl family repeats, can be cleaved efficiently in a regular pattern by the enzyme. These data are discussed in terms of the mode of recognition of DNA sequences/structures by topoisomerase I, and its possible roles in the nonhomologous insertion of repetitive DNA sequences.;polycysteine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
1709;26328611;Large scale transcriptome analysis reveals interplay between development of forest trees and a beneficial mycorrhiza helper bacterium.;Pedunculate oak, Quercus robur is an abundant forest tree species that hosts a large and diverse community of beneficial ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMFs), whereby ectomycorrhiza (EM) formation is stimulated by mycorrhiza helper bacteria such as Streptomyces sp. AcH 505. Oaks typically grow rhythmically, with alternating root flushes (RFs) and shoot flushes (SFs). We explored the poorly understood mechanisms by which oaks integrate signals induced by their beneficial microbes and endogenous rhythmic growth at the level of gene expression. To this end, we compared transcript profiles of oak microcuttings at RF and SF during interactions with AcH 505 alone and in combination with the basidiomycetous EMF Piloderma croceum. The local root and distal leaf responses to the microorganisms differed substantially. More genes involved in the recognition of bacteria and fungi, defence and cell wall remodelling related transcription factors (TFs) were differentially expressed in the roots than in the leaves of oaks. In addition, interaction with AcH 505 and P. croceum affected the expression of a higher number of genes during SF than during RF, including AcH 505 elicited defence response, which was attenuated by co-inoculation with P. croceum in the roots during SF. Genes encoding leucine-rich receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) and proteins (LRR-RLPs), LRR containing defence response regulators, TFs from bZIP, ERF and WRKY families, xyloglucan cell wall transglycolases/hydrolases and exordium proteins were differentially expressed in both roots and leaves of plants treated with AcH 505. Only few genes, including specific RLKs and TFs, were induced in both AcH 505 and co-inoculation treatments. Treatment with AcH 505 induces and maintains the expression levels of signalling genes encoding candidate receptor protein kinases and TFs and leads to differential expression of cell wall modification related genes in pedunculate oak microcuttings. Local gene expression response to AcH 505 alone and in combination with P. croceum are more pronounced when roots are in resting stages, possibly due to the fact that non growing roots re-direct their activity towards plant defence rather than growth. ;polyleucine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

The profile of this primary response is remarkably parallel to that of c-myc in the Balb/c 3T3 cell line. The structure of the 23.2-kilobase h crp gene demonstrates that it is a member of a gene superfamily encoding proteins sharing a highly characteristic 52-amino acid ""LIM/double-finger"" motif. The evolutionarily conserved structure of cysteine-rich protein, its structural similarity to a number of developmentally critical proteins, its distinctive tissue distribution, and its primary response to early events in the cell cycle suggest that crp plays an important role in cell function.

Often asymptomatic, the suspicion arises because of abnormal aminotransferases or a bright liver on abdominal ultrasound. It should be suspected during evaluation of associated conditions as obesity, diabetes or dyslipidaemia. The diagnostic evaluation must exclude other potential causes of liver disease and may include a liver biopsy, the only method able to confirm features of necroinflammation and fibrosis that define NASH and its prognostic implications. Indeed, the presence of necroinflammation has been associated with a significant risk of progression to cirrhosis and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma. Age >45 years, obesity and diabetes have also been associated with an increased risk of liver fibrosis and progression to cirrhosis. Given the high prevalence of NAFLD, general measures of life-style changes, focusing on exercise, diet, and total alcohol abstinence, should be implemented before a liver biopsy is considered.;-;-;-;hard_0
1713;8218921;Simulation of alpha-helix-coil transitions in simplified polyvaline: equilibrium properties and Brownian dynamics.;A quantitative understanding of helix-coil dynamics will help explain their role in protein folding and in folded proteins. As a contribution to the understanding, the equilibrium and dynamical aspects of the helix-coil transition in polyvaline have been studied by computer simulation using a simplified model of the polypeptide chain. Each amino acid residue is treated as a single quasi-particle in an effective potential that approximates the potential of mean force in solution. The equilibrium properties examined include the helix-coil transition and its dependence on chain position and well depth at the coil-helix interface. A stochastic simulation of the Brownian motion of the chain in its solvent surroundings has been used to investigate dynamical properties. Time histories of the dihedral angles have been used to study the behavior of the helical structure. Auto and cross-correlation functions have been calculated from the time histories and from the state (helix or coil) functions of the residues with relaxation times of tens to hundreds of picoseconds. Helix-coil rate constants of tens of ns-1 were found for both directions of the transition.; polyvaline ;helix;-;LCR_with_function
1717;7848295;Changes in the structure of bovine phospholipase A2 upon micelle binding.;Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is a calcium-dependent enzyme which hydrolyses the 2-acyl ester bond of phospholipids. The extracellular PLA2s are activated by as much as 10000-fold on binding to micelles or vesicles of substrate, possibly due to a conformational change induced in the enzyme. We have studied the complex of bovine pancreatic PLA2 with micelles of SDS by ultracentrifugation, equilibrium dialysis, microcalorimetry, fluorescence and n.m.r. spectroscopy. Ultracentrifugation and equilibrium dialysis measurements showed that on average 1.28 (+/- 0.17) PLA2 molecules and 26.4 (+/- 3.1) SDS molecules are involved in the complex and that there is a rapid equilibrium between micellar species containing one or more enzyme monomers. The estimated heat of formation of the complex, measured calorimetrically as the heat released when PLA2 was injected into excess 10 mM SDS, was 162.3 +/- 1.5) kJ/mol [38.8 (+/- 0.35) kcal/mol] of PLA2 added. The fluorescence of the single tryptophan at position 3 in the N-terminal helix of the protein increases when PLA2 binds to SDS micelles, indicating that this part of the protein is in a more hydrophobic environment in the complex. The structural changes in PLA2 on addition of [2H25]SDS were monitored using n.m.r. spectroscopy. The overall structure of the protein is unchanged, but changes in nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) were observed for residues in the N-terminal helix, at the active site region and in a lysine-rich region near the C-terminus. The NOE changes at the N-terminus indicate that this portion of the protein molecule adopts a more ordered, helical conformation when bound to a micelle. We suggest that these conformational changes could be the mechanism by which the enzyme becomes activated in the presence of aggregated substrate.;polylysine;helix;-;LCR_with_function

This activity depends on C-terminal but not N-terminal zinc fingers, as does in vitro DNA binding. By site-specific mutagenesis and binding site selection, we define the critical amino acid-base interactions. Mutations of single amino acid residues at the leading edge of the recognition helix are rarely neutral: many result in a slight change in affinity for the ideal DNA target site; some cause major loss of affinity; and others change specificity for as many as two bases in the target site. Compared to zinc fingers that recognize G+C-rich DNA, CF2II fingers appear to bind to A+T-rich DNA in a generally similar manner, but with additional flexibility and amino acid-base interactions. The results illustrate how zinc fingers may be evolving to recognize an unusually diverse set of DNA sequences. ";polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

To report a case of possible ticlopidine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).


CASE SUMMARY
A 68-year-old man was started on ticlopidine therapy for transient ischemic attack because of aspirin intolerance. Three weeks after starting therapy, the patient developed TTP, manifest by severe thrombocytopenia, renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and neurologic symptoms. The condition reversed over three to five days coincident with the discontinuation of ticlopidine and therapy with daily plasma infusion and exchange. No evidence of relapse was found at one-year follow-up.


DISCUSSION
TTP is a well-defined clinical entity with varied etiologies. Ticlopidine has been reported as causing neutropenia and isolated thrombocytopenia. Case reports have linked ticlopidine to the development of TTP.


CONCLUSIONS
Including this case there are now seven patients who have been documented as developing TTP while receiving ticlopidine. In addition to monitoring for neutropenia and isolated thrombocytopenia, patients receiving ticlopidine also should be monitored for the development of TTP.";-;-;-;hard_0
1724;10431249;Sry requires a CAG repeat domain for male sex determination in Mus musculus.;SRY, the mammalian Y-chromosomal sex-determining gene, encodes a protein characterized by a DNA-binding and -bending domain referred to as the HMG box. Despite the pivotal role of this gene, only the HMG box region has been conserved through evolution, suggesting that SRY function depends solely on the HMG box and therefore acts as an architectural transcription factor. In mice (genus Mus) Sry also includes a large CAG trinucleotide repeat region encoding a carboxy-terminal glutamine-rich domain that acts as a transcriptional trans-activator in vitro. The absence of this or any other potential trans-activating domain in other mammals, however, has raised doubts as to its biological relevance. To test directly whether the glutamine-rich region is required for Sry function in vivo, we created truncation mutations of the Mus musculus musculus Sry gene and tested their ability to induce testis formation in XX embryos using a transgenic mouse assay. Sry constructs that encode proteins lacking the glutamine-rich region were unable to effect male sex determination, in contrast to their wild-type counterparts. We conclude that the glutamine-rich repeat domain of the mouse Sry protein has an essential role in sex determination in vivo, and that Sry may act via a fundamentally different biochemical mechanism in mice compared with other mammals. ;polyglutamine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

1734;8752180;E-cadherin expression in human breast cancer cells suppresses the development of osteolytic bone metastases in an experimental metastasis model.;The molecular mechanisms by which human cancer cells spread to bone are largely unexplored. The process likely involves cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) that are responsible for homophilic and heterophilic cell-cell interactions. One relevant CAM may be the calcium-dependent transmembrane glycoprotein E-cadherin. To investigate the involvement of E-cadherin in breast cancer metastasis to bone, we used an in vivo model in which osteolytic bone metastases preferentially occur after injections of cancer cells directly into the arterial circulation through the left ventricle of the hearts of nude mice. We have found that E-cadherin-negative human breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 (MDA-231) develop radiographically detectable multiple osteolytic bone metastases and cachexia in this model. However, MDA-231 breast cancer cells that were transfected with E-cadherin cDNA showed a dramatically impaired capacity to form osteolytic metastases and induce cachexia. Histological and histomorphometrical analyses of bones of mice bearing mock-transfected MDA-231 revealed aggressive metastatic tumor, whereas metastatic tumor burden was significantly decreased in the bones of mice bearing E-cadherin-expressing MDA-231. Nude mice bearing E-cadherin-transfected MDA-231 breast cancer cells survived longer than mice bearing mock-transfected MDA-231 breast cancer cells. Anchorage-dependent and -independent growth in culture and tumor enlargement in the mammary fat pad of nude mice were unchanged between mock-transfected and E-cadherin-expressing MDA-231, suggesting that these differences in metastatic behavior are not due to an impairment of cell growth and tumor-igenicity. Our results show the suppressive effects of E-cadherin expression on bone metastasis by circulating breast cancer cells and suggest that the modulation of expression of this CAM may reduce the destructive effects of breast cancer cells on bone.;-;-;-;hard_0
1735;8321243;A novel, tissue-restricted zinc finger protein (HF-1b) binds to the cardiac regulatory element (HF-1b/MEF-2) in the rat myosin light-chain 2 gene.;The AT-rich element MEF-2 plays an important role in the maintenance of the muscle-specific expression of a number of cardiac and skeletal muscle genes. In the MLC-2 gene, an AT-rich element (HF-1b) which contains a consensus MEF-2 site is required for cardiac tissue-specific expression. The present study reports the isolation and characterization of a cDNA which encodes a novel C2H2 zinc finger (HF-1b) that binds in a sequence-specific manner to the HF-1b/MEF-2 site in the MLC-2 promoter. A number of independent criteria suggest that this HF-1b zinc finger protein is a component of the endogenous HF-1b/MEF-2 binding activity in cardiac muscle cells and that it can serve as a transcriptional activator of the MLC-2 promoter in transient assays. These studies suggest that, in addition to the previously reported RSRF proteins, structurally divergent transcriptional factors can bind to MEF-2-like sites in muscle promoters. These results underscore the complexity of the regulation of the muscle gene program via these AT-rich elements in cardiac and skeletal muscle. ;polythreonine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function

This assay provides a simple and efficient alternative to traditional 96-well plate ELISAs, which take 5-8h to complete and are limited to one analyte. Further, the modularity of the magnetic bead-based SCSD ELISA format could serve as a platform for application to other diseases for which multi-biomarker detection is advantageous. ;polyhistidine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
1745;9688653;Rat serum induces a differentiated phenotype in a rat parotid acinar cell line.;To establish a continuous cell line, freshly prepared rat parotid acinar cells were stably transfected with a plasmid vector containing the SV40 large T antigen. The acinar origin of these cells was confirmed by Western blotting, enzyme analysis, and morphological analysis. Transformed cells grown in 10% rat serum showed a modest reduction in cell number after 7 days and a concentration- and time-dependent increase in amylase levels approximately 16 times greater than those observed in fetal bovine serum-treated cells. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that cells grown in rat serum harbored protein-filled secretory granules localized adjacent to the endoplasmic reticulum, and punctate amylase-specific immunofluorescence distributed throughout the cytoplasm was consistent with the presence of amylase in secretory organelles. Clonal cells express tissue-specific proline-rich proteins and the four protein kinase C isozymes present in primary culture. Carbachol and isoproterenol stimulated [3H]protein secretion and isoproterenol enhanced amylase secretion from cells grown in rat serum. Moreover, norepinephrine, carbachol, and substance P produced a time- and concentration-dependent rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+. This continuous cell line of parotid acinar cells, which after treatment with rat serum retains the basic structural and functional properties of primary culture cells, will be utilized as a model system for studying long-term biological processes that regulate parotid cell function.;polyproline;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
1748;32828541;Genome-wide analyses of direct target genes of an ERF11 transcription factor involved in plant defense against bacterial pathogens.;Ethylene responsive factor ERF11 containing the ERF-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif enhances plant resistance to bacterial pathogens. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms regulated by transcription factor ERF11 are poorly understood, in tobacco or other model plants. Here, we revealed the genome-wide binding landscape of BrERF11b in Nicotiana benthamian by conducting chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) and bioinformatic analyses. Our results also revealed a GCCbox-like consensus BrERF11b-binding DNA motif: VCGCCGCC. By further integrative analysis of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data, and the confirmation of electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), we screened three direct target genes NbNIMIN2, NbTAF15b and NbERF4. These results suggest that ERF11 may be involved in NPR1-mediated systemic acquired resistance (SAR), nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat immune receptors (NLR) -mediated autoimmunity, and H2O2 generation, by direct transcriptional repression of NIM1-INTERACTING2 (NIMIN2), and transcriptional activation of TATA-binding protein-associated factor 15b (TAF15b) and ERF4.

The aluminium hydroxide (alum)-adsorbed SPf66 vaccine is weakly immunogenic and of poor to moderate efficacy in humans. To investigate the possibility of improving SPf66 vaccine immunogenicity, a delivery system based on poly-D,L-lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) microspheres was developed and the immune response induced after its subcutaneous administration into mice was evaluated. Microspheres were prepared by a solvent extraction/double emulsion (w/o/w) method and characterised for morphology, size, peptide loading, release profile and peptide integrity. The in vitro and in vivo results obtained showed that there was no apparent effect of the encapsulation procedure on SPf66 integrity and immunogenicity. The subcutaneous administration of microspheres showed a significantly higher immune response (serum IgG levels) than that obtained with alum adsorbed SPf66 and it was comparable to that of SPf66 emulsified with Freund's adjuvant (FA). These observations illustrate the potential of PLGA microspheres as a delivery system for chemically synthesised antigens. ;polyaspartic;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

However, the relationship between these indices and caudate volume has not been documented previously. In this study, we used high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine the effects of normal aging on the bicaudate and bifrontal indices and to study the relationship between these indices and caudate volume. The subjects were 49 normal volunteers, aged 22 to 82 years, who were without any significant neurologic or psychiatric disorders. Age was positively correlated with bicaudate index (r = .59; P < .0001) and bifrontal index (r = .40; P < .0047). Age was negatively correlated with caudate nuclei volume (r = -.47; P < .0005). Caudate volume was negatively correlated with bicaudate (r = -.27; P < .06) and bifrontal (r = -.31; P < .03) indices. These findings are consistent with prior reports of caudate nuclei degeneration with increasing age.

1763;26916774;What is effective care for varicose veins?;Varicose veins affect one-quarter to one-third of Western adult populations and consume an increasing amount of health care resources. Much of this increased utilization has been driven by the advent of minimally invasive technology including endovenous thermal ablation, foam sclerotherapy, and more recently mechanicochemical and cyanoacrylate glue ablation. This has largely been driven by patient and physician preferences in the absence of robust evidence that one therapy is truly superior to another. This partially arises from misunderstandings about appropriate outcomes measures and what truly constitutes effective treatment of varicose veins. Technical outcomes, such as saphenous closure rates, have frequently been used as surrogates for effective treatment but are poorly correlated with symptom improvement, quality of life, and risk of recurrence. Although there does appear to be a trend towards higher recurrence with ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy, the data are occasionally conflicting and there does not appear to be substantial differences between the various modalities. Similarly, there do not appear to be major differences in late quality of life measures between these treatment options. As long-term differences in recurrence and quality of life are small, overall cost effectiveness is driven primarily by initial treatment costs and ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy is the most cost-effective strategy in many models. However, there continues to be substantial uncertainty surrounding cost estimates and other factors of importance to the patient may ultimately drive treatment decisions. The benefits of some adjuncts to the treatment of axial superficial reflux, such as the concurrent versus staged management of tributary varicosities, remain ill-defined while that of others, such as routine post-procedural ultrasound surveillance and compression, need critical re-evaluation.;-;-;-;hard_0

We used immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization to localize this enzyme in adult and fetal bovine retinas. Specific ALDH immunoreactivity was present in the cytoplasm of wide-field amacrine cells restricted in distribution to the dorsal part of the adult retina. The somata diameters ranged from approximately 8 microns to approximately 15 microns, and the cells increased in density from approximately 125 cells/mm2 near the horizontal meridian to approximately 425 cells/mm2 in the superior far periphery. The ALDH-positive cells had somata on both sides of the inner plexiform layer (IPL) and processes in two IPL strata. The majority of ALDH-positive cells were unreactive with antibodies against known amacrine cell enzymes and neurotransmitters, including GABA and glycine. The ALDH-positive amacrine cells also did not react with anti-cellular retinoic acid-binding protein, which was present in a subset of GABA-positive amacrine cells. In flat-mounted retinas processed by in situ hybridization, the larger ALDH-positive amacrine cells tended to be more heavily labeled. In addition to amacrine cells, Müller cell processes in the inner retina were weakly immunoreactive for ALDH; however, these glial cells did not contain ALDH mRNA. The pattern of ALDH expression in fetal bovine retinas was documented by immunocytochemistry. No ALDH reactivity was found before 5.5 months; for the remainder of the fetal period, ALDH immunoreactivity was present in amacrine cells similar to those in adult retina. The ALDH-positive amacrine cells in bovine retina are novel, being limited in distribution to the dorsal retina and unlabeled with other amacrine cell-specific markers. Identification of ALDH in amacrine cells provides additional evidence that cells of the inner retina are involved in retinoid metabolism.";-;-;-;hard_0
1774;7955204;Mithramycin inhibits myointimal proliferation after balloon injury of the rat carotid artery in vivo.;"BACKGROUND
Smooth muscle proliferation and extracellular matrix formation in the subintimal region of blood vessels that have been subjected to intimal injury are responsible for restenosis following balloon angioplasty of the coronary arteries and for accelerated atherosclerosis in a variety of other pathophysiological states. The immediate early-response gene c-myc is overexpressed in proliferating vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro, and c-myc antisense oligomers have been shown to reduce c-myc expression and to inhibit proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells in culture. Mithramycin is a commercially available G-C-specific DNA binding drug that selectively inhibits transcription of genes, such as c-myc, that have G-C-rich promoter sequences. This study tested the hypothesis that mithramycin inhibits transcription of the c-myc proto-oncogene and prevents myointimal proliferation after balloon injury of the rat carotid artery in vivo.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Ten-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats received mithramycin (150 micrograms/kg IP) or distilled H2O 1 hour before and 1 hour after balloon injury of the right common carotid artery. After 2 weeks, the rats were killed by overdose of pentobarbital, and the injured right and uninjured control left arteries were pressure-fixed and subjected to morphological analysis for evaluation of the degree of myointimal thickening. Separate groups of rats were killed at 2 and 6 hours after vascular injury, and total RNA from injured and control vessels of mithramycin- and vehicle-treated rats was subjected to Northern analysis for assessment of steady-state c-myc mRNA levels. The areas of neointima and the ratios of neointimal to medial area were significantly less in mithramycin-treated than in control rats (0.6 +/- 0.1 versus 1.2 +/- 0.1 mm2, P < .01 and 95 +/- 16% versus 190 +/- 14%, P < .01). Lumen size was significantly greater in mithramycin-treated than in control rats (1.5 +/- 0.1 versus 0.8 +/- 0.1 mm2, P < .01). Steady-state c-myc mRNA levels were increased 10-fold and 2-fold (compared with undamaged carotid arteries) at 2 and 6 hours after balloon injury, respectively; mithramycin treatment reduced c-myc mRNA levels at 2 and 6 hours by 66% and 53%, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
These results support the hypothesis that systemic administration of mithramycin immediately (1 hour before and after intervention effectively inhibits transcription of the c-myc proto-oncogene and prevents myointimal proliferation after balloon injury of the rat carotid artery in vivo. Because mithramycin has been shown to be well tolerated by humans and to effectively inhibit transcription of c-myc in proliferating human cells, this agent may be useful in the prevention of coronary restenosis.";polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Although the mRNA level of thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR beta) gradually decreased in the monolayer hepatocytes during culture, the mRNA level in the hepatocytes on EHS-gel was maintained at around the in vivo level. Our results suggest that the maintenance of TR beta mRNA on EHS-gel is responsible for the high responsiveness to thyroid hormone in a hepatocyte culture.;-;-;-;hard_0
1777;29219182;The emerging role of Hippo signaling pathway in regulating osteoclast formation.;A delicate balance between osteoblastic bone formation and osteoclastic bone resorption is crucial for bone homeostasis. This process is regulated by the Hippo signaling pathway including key regulatory molecules RASSF2, NF2, MST1/2, SAV1, LATS1/2, MOB1, YAP, and TAZ. It is well established that the Hippo signaling pathway plays an important part in regulating osteoblast differentiation, but its role in osteoclast formation and activation remains poorly understood. In this review, we discuss the emerging role of Hippo-signaling pathway in osteoclast formation and bone homeostasis. It is revealed that specific molecules of the Hippo-signaling pathway take part in a stage specific regulation in pre-osteoclast proliferation, osteoclast differentiation and osteoclast apoptosis and survival. Upon activation, MST and LAST, transcriptional co-activators YAP and TAZ bind to the members of the TEA domain (TEAD) family transcription factors, and influence osteoclast differentiation via regulating the expression of downstream target genes such as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) and cysteine-rich protein 61 (CYR61/CCN1). In addition, through interacting or cross talking with RANKL-mediated signaling cascades including NF-κB, MAPKs, AP1, and NFATc1, Hippo-signaling molecules such as YAP/TAZ/TEAD complex, RASSF2, MST2, and Ajuba could also potentially modulate osteoclast differentiation and function. Elucidating the roles of the Hippo-signaling pathway in osteoclast development and specific molecules involved is important for understanding the mechanism of bone homeostasis and diseases. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
1779;198143;Inhibition of viral protein synthesis in monkey cells treated with interferon late in simian virus 40 lytic cycle.;We have investigated the effect of interferon on SV40 gene expression late in the lytic cycle, after early functions have been expressed and viral DNA replication has been initiated. Whereas pretreatment with interferon prior to infection reduces the amount of early SV40 RNA, post-infection treatment does not inhibit viral RNA synthesis. Viral 19S and 16S RNA species are found undiminished in quantity and poly(A) content. Despite the apparent normalcy of viral RNA classes, however, there is a marked reduction in the synthesis of their protein products, both T antigen and capsid polypeptides. The association of viral RNA with heavy polyribosomes is strongly reduced. On the other hand, there is no degradation of nonviral polyribosomes and the synthesis of most cellular proteins continues. These experiments demonstrate that late in infection, interferon treatment results in an inhibition of viral mRNA translation.; polyalanine ;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
1781;8621056;Posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression in liver regeneration: role of mRNA stability.;The rentry of hepatocytes and nonparenchymal cells from the normal quiescent G0 phase into the cell cycle during liver regeneration after 70% partial hepatectomy results in the discrete modulation of mRNA transcripts for many different genes. The modulation of steady-state levels of transcripts for genes involved in hepatocyte growth and replication during liver regeneration indicates that gene expression is regulated not only transcriptionally but also posttranscriptionally. In fact, posttranscriptional control appears to be the primary mechanism of regulating gene expression after the first 3 h after partial hepatectomy. Alteration in transcript stability is a key posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism used by the regenerating liver to modulate the steady-state transcript levels of multiple genes. Even genes that are transcriptionally activated during liver regeneration exhibit posttranscriptional control at the level of transcript stability. Moreover, the abundance of mRNA binding proteins, as well as translational activity and rate of poly(A) tail removal, are modulated and appear to influence transcript stability during liver regeneration. However, alteration of transcript stability is not the sole posttranscriptional mechanism regulating steady-state levels. Posttranscriptional control also occurs at the level of alternative splicing, stabilization of heterogeneous nuclear (hn) RNA, and hnRNA processing. Moreover, the role of nucleocytoplasmic transport of mature mRNA during liver regeneration is still undefined. Thus, during liver regeneration gene expression is regulated at multiple levels after the initial synthesis of hnRNA. By understanding the role of posttranscriptional mechanisms in regulating steady-state transcript levels in an in vivo model of normal growth, we will begin to appreciate its role in the genesis of abnormal growth.; polyalanine ;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Characterizing the TBP binding sites revealed that in addition to the classical TATA box (TATAAA) five more elements occur significantly often in the promoters, nearly all of them being one point mutations of the classical TATA box element. Separate curvature calculations for promoters with canonical and non-canonical TATA boxes have shown that in both cases the strong curvature of the helix axes in the domain of the binding sites is maintained (classical TBP binding sites: + 64-135%, non-classical TBP binding sites: + 27-49%). These results support the proposition that beside DNA flexibility and DNA-protein interactions intrinsic curvature of DNA is one further important criterion for the recognition of different DNA elements by TBP.; polyalanine ;helix;-;LCR_with_function
1791;8889554;Tracing an ancestral mutation: genealogical and haplotype analysis of the infantile onset spinocerebellar ataxia locus.;Infantile onset spinocerebellar ataxia (IOSCA) is a progressive neurological syndrome exhibiting an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. The characteristic features were described in Finland in the beginning of 1990s. Having shown that IOSCA does not segregate with any of the markers linked to other hereditary ataxias and thus represents a genetically distinct disease, we assigned the locus of this new hereditary ataxia to 10q23.3-q24.1. To approximate the age of the Finnish IOSCA mutation and to investigate the possible existence of more than one mutation underlying the disease, the ancestors of 13 IOSCA families were identified by use of church records dating back to the 1500s. The IOSCA pedigrees were frequently merged, providing support for these having one common ancestor. Analysis of the extended IOSCA haplotypes exposed ancient recombination events and revealed one core haplotype of four markers on a region of approximately 2 cM, which was unequivocally present in 92% of disease chromosomes. Both genealogical and haplotype data thus suggest that a single IOSCA ancestral mutation was introduced into the Finnish population most probably approximately 30-40 generations ago before the time when the general east-west migration took place within Finland.;-;-;-;hard_0
1793;2371231;Deuterium D(V/K) isotope effects on ethanol oxidation in hepatocytes: importance of the reverse ADH-reaction.;The kinetic deuterium isotope effect, D(V/K), on ethanol oxidation was measured on hepatocytes from rat and pig by the radiometric competitive method using 14C-labelled ethanol containing deuterium in the (1-R)-position. The corrected D(V/K) values of 2.68 and 2.80 for rat and pig hepatocytes respectively were significantly different, suggesting differences in the amount of non-ADH ethanol oxidizing activity. The apparent isotope effects declined rapidly with time when acetaldehyde was present in the medium as a result of the reduction to ethanol of the [14C]-acetaldehyde formed from the double labelled ethanol by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Fructose and cyanamide caused the acetaldehyde concentration during ethanol oxidation to increase by entirely different mechanisms, and the isotope effect to decrease with time, as did also the addition of acetaldehyde. The apparent first order rate constant for the reverse ADH reaction, assuming the reactants to be acetaldehyde and the ADH-NADH complex, was determined by two methods giving comparable results. In the presence of semicarbazide, which removes acetaldehyde, the isotope effect was nearly constant. This was the case also when the acetaldehyde concentration was very low (less than 1 microM) for other reasons, as in hepatocytes from starved animals. A mathematical formula describing the expected decrease of the apparent isotope effect with time was derived. The different response of pig and rat hepatocytes to addition of fructose (the 'fructose effect') is suggested to be caused by differences in activity of aldehyde dehydrogenases in the two species.;-;-;-;hard_0

The results indicated that the ARGs abundance did not change significantly over time in the studied reservoir waterbodies. Tetracycline, sulfonamide, and β-lactam ARGs were dominant. The high abundance and detection rate of two sulfonamide ARGs(sul1 and sul2) suggested that they were the predominant ARGs. No polymyxin resistance genes(mcr-1) were detected, which indicated that the antibiotic restriction policy of China has achieved positive outcomes. Compared with that in other environmental media, the ARGs abundance in the reservoir environment was low. The correlation analysis showed relevance between the water quality indicators and the ARGs, which suggested that the water quality indexes can be used as ARGs pollution indicators in the reservoir environment. The abundance and detection rate of carbapenem ARGs were low owing to their dosage restriction and high degradability. Tetracycline ARGs were closely related to the other resistance gene types, which might have been due to horizontal gene transfer. Although the overall correlation between intI1 and ARGs was modest, it might be the main reason for the spread of several individual ARGs in the reservoir environment.;-;-;-;hard_0

1801;9606232;Outcome prediction in Greek neonatal intensive care units using a score for neonatal acute physiology (SNAP);"OBJECTIVES
This study was undertaken to evaluate the performance of the score for neonatal acute physiology (SNAP) in Greece, to examine the predictive power of SNAP calculated during the 12 hours after admission in comparison with customarily calculated SNAP during the first 24 hours, and to assess SNAP during the second 12 hours from admission as a measure of response to treatment.


METHODOLOGY
A total of 579 newborns admitted to three neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) from two cities in Greece were enrolled in the study; SNAP was determined during the first 12 hours, the second 12 hours, and the first 24 hours from admission to the NICU and calculated using an algorithm based on deviations from normal values of 26 physiologic parameters.


RESULTS
All three variants of SNAP were powerful predictors of vital status at discharge, as well as of duration of stay among survivors. A five-point increase in SNAP in the first 12 hours corresponds to a more than twofold ratio in the odds for death, whereas a five-unit difference in SNAP from the second 12 hours corresponds to a more than threefold ratio. The combined 24-hour score was similar to that for the first 12 hours. A considerable advantage of SNAP was its independence from more traditional predictors of neonatal death, notably gestational age, birth weight, and Apgar score. The combination of all of these predictors improved further the overall predictive potential.


CONCLUSIONS
SNAP is a useful tool in medical research and can be applied in different population groups. Its independence from birth weight underlines its added value to predict fatality ratios. Moreover, the results of the present study indicate that SNAP can be estimated without loss of predictive efficiency during the first 12 hours from admission to the NICU, whereas SNAP during the second 12 hours adequately reflects the effectiveness of early medical interventions.";-;-;-;hard_0
1803;21388422;IgE cross-reactivity between Ascaris lumbricoides and mite allergens: possible influences on allergic sensitization and asthma.;Nematode infections such as Ascariasis are important health problems in underdeveloped countries, most of them located in the tropics where environmental conditions also promote the perennial co-exposure to high concentrations of domestic mite allergens. Allergic diseases are common, and most of patients with asthma exhibit a predominant and strong IgE sensitization to mites. It is unknown whether co-exposure to Ascaris lumbricoides and the domestic mites Blomia tropicalis and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus potentiates Th2 responses and IgE sensitization, thereby modifying the natural history of allergy. Recently, we obtained experimental evidence of a high cross-reactivity between the allergenic extracts of these invertebrates, involving well-known allergens such as tropomyosin and glutathione transferases. There is indirect evidence suggesting that the clinical impact of these findings may be important. In this review, we discuss the potential role of this cross-reactivity on several aspects of allergy in the tropics that have been a focus of a number of investigations, some of them with controversial results.;-;-;-;hard_0
1804;16702209;The early-immediate gene EGR-1 is induced by transforming growth factor-beta and mediates stimulation of collagen gene expression.;Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) stimulates collagen synthesis and accumulation, and aberrant TGF-beta signaling is implicated in pathological organ fibrosis. Regulation of type I procollagen gene (COL1A2) transcription by TGF-beta involves the canonical Smad signaling pathway as well as additional protein and lipid kinases, coactivators, and DNA-binding transcription factors that constitute alternate non-Smad pathways. By using Affymetrix microarrays to detect cellular genes whose expression is regulated by Smad3, we identified early growth response factor-1 (EGR-1) as a novel Smad3-inducible gene. Previous studies implicated Egr-1 in cell growth, differentiation, and survival. We found that TGF-beta induced rapid and transient accumulation of Egr-1 protein and mRNA in human skin fibroblasts. In transient transfection assays, TGF-beta stimulated the activity of the Egr-1 gene promoter, as well as that of a minimal Egr-1-responsive reporter construct. Furthermore, TGF-beta enhanced endogenous Egr-1 interaction with a consensus Egr-1-binding site element and with GC-rich DNA sequences of the human COL1A2 promoter in vitro and in vivo. Forced expression of Egr-1 by itself caused dose-dependent up-regulation of COL1A2 promoter activity and further enhanced the stimulation induced by TGF-beta. In contrast, the TGF-beta response was abrogated when the Egr-1-binding sites of the COL1A2 promoter were mutated or deleted. Furthermore, Egr-1-deficient embryonic mouse fibroblasts showed attenuated TGF-beta responses despite intact Smad activation, and forced expression of ectopic EGR-1 in these cells could restore COL1A2 stimulation in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, these findings identify Egr-1 as a novel intracellular TGF-beta target that is necessary for maximal stimulation of collagen gene expression in fibroblasts. The results therefore implicate Egr-1 in the profibrotic responses elicited by TGF-beta and suggest that Egr-1 may play a new and important role in the pathogenesis of fibrosis. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

A pars plana approach.;Two larvae of Taenia solium (eg, Cysticercus cellulosae) were identified in the posterior vitreous attached to the optic nervehead of a 13-year-old Guatemalan girl. Preoperative evaluation showed the larvae to be viable. The vitreous showed a mild cellular reaction. The larvae were dissected off the optic nervehead and removed via a pars plana approach, without incident. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of cysticerci attached to the optic nervehead that were removed successfully by the pars plana approach. The patient was treated with a very short preoperative and postoperative course of corticosteroids. No inflammatory flare-ups or recurrence of the cysticercosis were found during the one-year follow-up period.;-;-;-;hard_0
1815;6639078;The effect of a phase transition on penetration of phospholipid monolayers by melittin and glucagon.;The penetration of melittin and glucagon into phospholipid monolayers was studied by measuring compression isotherms of phospholipids in the absence and presence of various concentrations of protein in the subphase. Differences in molecular area were calculated as a function of protein concentration at constant pressure. Area change as a function of surface pressure at constant protein concentration was also calculated. Melittin showed greater affinity for penetration into phosphatidylglycerol (PG) than into phosphatidylcholine (PC) monolayers. The cutoff pressure for melittin penetration was 45 mN/m with PC and 60 mN/m (extrapolated) with PG. Dipalmitoyl PC and PG monolayers show phase transitions upon compression at 25 degrees C. Both melittin and glucagon showed increased penetration as measured by area change within the region of the phase transition with both lipids. Glucagon showed a cutoff pressure of 25 mN/m for penetration into dimyristoyl PC. The preference of glucagon for interaction with lipid bilayers in the gel phase is discussed with respect to monolayer penetration as a function of surface pressure.;-;-;-;hard_0
1821;27014017;Seizure Prediction and Detection via Phase and Amplitude Lock Values.;"A robust seizure prediction methodology would enable a ""closed-loop"" system that would only activate as impending seizure activity is detected. Such a system would eliminate ongoing stimulation to the brain, thereby eliminating such side effects as coughing, hoarseness, voice alteration, and paresthesias (Murphy et al., 1998; Ben-Menachem, 2001), while preserving overall battery life of the system. The seizure prediction and detection algorithm uses Phase/Amplitude Lock Values (PLV/ALV) which calculate the difference of phase and amplitude between electroencephalogram (EEG) electrodes local and remote to the epileptic event. PLV is used as the seizure prediction marker and signifies the emergence of abnormal neuronal activations through local neuron populations. PLV/ALVs are used as seizure detection markers to demarcate the seizure event, or when the local seizure event has propagated throughout the brain turning into a grand-mal event. We verify the performance of this methodology against the ""CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database"" which features seizure attributes for testing. Through this testing, we can demonstrate a high degree of sensivity and precision of our methodology between pre-ictal and ictal events.";-;-;-;hard_0

1825;34704058;Dual concentration-dependent effect of ascorbic acid on PAP(248-286) amyloid formation and SEVI-mediated HIV infection.;Human semen contains various amyloidogenic peptides derived from Prostatic Acid Phosphatase (PAP) and Semenogelin proteins that are capable of enhancing HIV-1 infection when assembled into fibrils. The best characterized among them is a 39 amino acid peptide PAP(248-286), which forms amyloid fibrils termed SEVI (semen-derived enhancer of viral infection) that increase the infectivity of HIV-1 by orders of magnitude. Inhibiting amyloid formation by PAP(248-286) may mitigate the sexual transmission of HIV-1. Several vitamins have been shown to reduce the aggregation of amyloids such as Aβ, α-Synuclein, and Tau, which are associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Since ascorbic acid (AA, vitamin C) is the most abundant vitamin in semen with average concentrations of 0.4 mM, we here examined how AA affects PAP(248-286) aggregation in vitro. Using ThT binding assays, transmission electron microscopy, and circular dichroism spectroscopy, a dual and concentration-dependent behavior of AA in modulating PAP(248-286) fibril formation was observed. We found that low molar ratios of AA:PAP(248-286) promoted whereas high molar ratios inhibited PAP(248-286) fibril formation. Accordingly, PAP(248-286) aggregated in the presence of low amounts of AA enhanced HIV-1 infection, whereas excess amounts of AA during aggregation reduced the infectivity enhancing effect in cell culture. Collectively, this work provides a biophysical insight into the effect of AA, an important seminal component, on SEVI fibrillation which might impact amyloid formation kinetics, thereby modulating the biological activity of semen amyloids.;-;-;-;hard_0
1828;36426348;A novel built-in adjuvant metallothionein-3 aids protein antigens to induce rapid, robust, and durable immune responses.;Adjuvants are crucial components of vaccines that can enhance and modulate antigen-specific immune responses. Herein, we reported for the first time that human metallothionein-3 (MT3), a low molecular weight cysteine-rich metal-binding protein, was a novel promising adjuvant candidate that could help protein antigens to induce rapid, effective, and durable antigen-specific immune responses. In the present study, MT3 was fused to outer membrane protein 19 (Omp19) of Brucella abortus (MT3-Omp19, MO) and C fragment heavy chain (Hc) of tetanus neurotoxin (MT3-Hc, MH), respectively. The results showed that MT3 as a built-in adjuvant increased the Omp19- or Hc-specific antibody responses by 100-1000 folds in seven days after primary immunization. Compared to other commercially available adjuvants, MT3 could stimulate earlier (4 days after primary injection) and stronger (10-100 folds) antibody response with lower antigen dose, and its adjuvanticity relied on fusion to antigen. Although the mechanism was not clear yet, the fusion protein MO was observed to directly activate DCs, promote germinal center formation and improve the speed of Ig class switching. Interestingly, our subsequent study found that other members of the mammalian MT family (human MT1 or murine MT3 for examples) also had potential adjuvant effects, but their effects were lower than human MT3. Overall, this study explored a new function of human MT3 as a novel built-in adjuvant, which may have important clinical application potential in vaccine development against global pandemics.;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
1831;6846053;Increase in the resistance of stenotic coronary segment by intravenous infusion of isoproterenol.;The effects of intravenous infusion of isoproterenol on stenosis resistance were studied in the anesthetized open-chest dog. The circumflex coronary artery (LCx) was isolated near its origin and an electromagnetic flow transducer was placed around the vessel for measuring coronary flow. A polyethylene catheter was inserted into the small branch of LCx for monitoring distal coronary pressure. LCx was constricted with a thick cotton string to a degree of obstruction that eliminated reactive hyperemia following a 20-second coronary occlusion. The coronary resistance across the stenotic segment (RL) was calculated as the pressure gradient across the stenosis divided by coronary flow. Isoproterenol was infused intravenously in a dose to keep the heart rate at a level 25-30% above the control with and without coronary constriction. For maintaining the ascending aortic pressure at the pre-isoproterenol level, the descending thoracic aorta was constricted with a tape. In the absence of coronary constriction, the vascular resistance of large coronary arteries was not affected by isoproterenol with a significant increase in coronary flow. In the presence of coronary stenosis, isoproterenol markedly increased RI regardless of additional aortic constriction. The magnitude of the increase in RL during aortic constriction varied directly with the percent increase in the pressure gradient across the coronary stenosis. Pacing-tachycardia essentially did not affect RL. These results suggest that isoproterenol increased the vascular resistance of the stenotic segment with fixed caliber.;-;-;-;hard_0
1834;9631249;The long-term impact of child abuse on religious behavior and spirituality in men.;"OBJECTIVE
Two hypotheses were tested: (1) In a sample of adult men, past experience of child abuse (sexual, physical, or emotional) will be related to higher levels of reported alienation from religion and God as shown in lower rates of current religious behavior, higher frequency of spiritual ""injury,"" and lower stability of religious behavior and experiences; (2) More ""severe"" forms of abuse will be associated with higher indicators of alienation.


METHOD
Data were collected from 1,207 male veterans, 527 (43.7%) of whom reported being abused as a child. Each subject completed the Spiritual Issues Assessment, a large survey which includes data about: (1) KASL Religiosity Index; (2) The Spiritual Injury Scale; and (3) Religious items from the Westberg Personal Health Inventory.


RESULTS
A history of sexual abuse was related to significantly greater spiritual injury and lower stability of spiritual behaviors and experiences, but not to overall rate of current religious behavior. Surprisingly, abuse was related to increased frequency of prayer and of ""spiritual experience."" Multivariate analyses indicate that the effect size is relatively small and the type of abuse was less important than the presence of any form of abuse.


CONCLUSIONS
The findings suggest that the impact of childhood abuse is more complex than initially hypothesized. While abuse seems to be related to continuing spiritual injury and distress, it is also related to higher levels of some spiritual activities and experiences which are usually associated with positive spirituality.";-;-;-;hard_0
1836;28660537;In Silico Analysis of nsSNPs of Carp TLR22 Gene Affecting its Binding Ability with Poly I:C.;Immune response mediated by toll-like receptor 22 (TLR22), only found in teleost/amphibians, is triggered by double-stranded RNA binding to its LRR (leucine-rich repeats) ecto-domain. Accumulated evidences suggested that missense mutations in TLR genes affect its function. However, information on mutation linked pathogen recognition for TLR22 was lacking. The present study was commenced for predicting the effect of non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) on the pathogen recognizable LRR domain of TLR22 of farmed carp, Labeo rohita. The sequence-based algorithms (SIFT, PROVEAN and I-Mutant2.0) indicated that three SNPs (out of 27) such as p.L159F (rs76759876) and p.L529P (rs749355507) of LRR, and p.I836M (rs750758397) of intracellular motifs could potentially disrupt protein function. The 3D structure was generated using MODELLER 9.13 and further validated by SAVEs server. The simulated molecular docking of native TLR22 and mutants with poly I:C ligand indicated that mutations positioned at p.L159F and p.L529P of the LRR region affects the binding affinity significantly. This is the first kind of study of predicting nsSNPs of teleost TLR22 with disturbed ligand binding affinity with its extra-cellular LRR domain and thereby likely hindrance in subsequent signal transduction. This study serves as a guide for in vivo evaluation of impact of mutation on immune response mediated by teleost TLR22 gene. ;polyleucine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
1837;3306478;Presynaptic elements on artificial surfaces. A model for the study of development and regeneration of synapses.;"Recently a model has been developed to study the synapse formation in which the components of a synapse can be isolated and examined independently. The observation of neurites forming presynaptic elements on polylysine-coated surfaces is a model for which the formation of presynaptic elements can be studied independently of a cellular postsynaptic element. Studies with neurons from both cell cultures and the intact cerebellum have shown that beads coated with poly-basic proteins can serve as a ""postsynaptic element."" With use of this system, observation have shown that the presynaptic element can form quickly, within 3 h, and contain many of the characteristics of a mature presynaptic element, such as synaptic vesicle antigens. Additional studies have shown that astrocytes appear to be involved in the loss or removal of the presynaptic elements on beads. Thus, synaptogenesis may involve the development of inappropriate synaptic contacts, which are eliminated by astrocytes. The lack of regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS) also may involve the astrocyte's ability to remove immature and/or inappropriate presynaptic elements and growth cones as they attempt to cross the lesion site.";polylysine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
1839;28985358;Identification of Plagl1/Zac1 binding sites and target genes establishes its role in the regulation of extracellular matrix genes and the imprinted gene network.;PLAGL1/ZAC1 undergoes parental genomic imprinting, is paternally expressed, and is a member of the imprinted gene network (IGN). It encodes a zinc finger transcription factor with anti-proliferative activity and is a candidate tumor suppressor gene on 6q24 whose expression is frequently lost in various neoplasms. Conversely, gain of PLAGL1 function is responsible for transient neonatal diabetes mellitus, a rare genetic disease that results from defective pancreas development. In the present work, we showed that Plagl1 up-regulation was not associated with DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest. It was rather associated with physiological cell cycle exit that occurred with contact inhibition, growth factor withdrawal, or cell differentiation. To gain insights into Plagl1 mechanism of action, we identified Plagl1 target genes by combining chromatin immunoprecipitation and genome-wide transcriptomics in transfected cell lines. Plagl1-elicited gene regulation correlated with multiple binding to the proximal promoter region through a GC-rich motif. Plagl1 target genes included numerous genes involved in signaling, cell adhesion, and extracellular matrix composition, including collagens. Plagl1 targets also included 22% of the 409 genes that make up the IGN. Altogether, this work identified Plagl1 as a transcription factor that coordinated the regulation of a subset of IGN genes and controlled extracellular matrix composition. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
1846;33122294;Molecular mechanism for the interaction between human CPSF30 and hFip1.;Most eukaryotic pre-mRNAs must undergo 3'-end cleavage and polyadenylation prior to their export from the nucleus. A large number of proteins in several complexes participate in this 3'-end processing, including cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) in mammals. The CPSF30 subunit contains five CCCH zinc fingers (ZFs), with ZF2-ZF3 being required for the recognition of the AAUAAA poly(A) signal. ZF4-ZF5 recruits the hFip1 subunit of CPSF, although the details of this interaction have not been characterized. Here we report the crystal structure of human CPSF30 ZF4-ZF5 in complex with residues 161-200 of hFip1 at 1.9 Å resolution, illuminating the molecular basis for their interaction. Unexpectedly, the structure reveals one hFip1 molecule binding to each ZF4 and ZF5, with a conserved mode of interaction. Our mutagenesis studies confirm that the CPSF30-hFip1 complex has 1:2 stoichiometry in vitro. Mutation of each binding site in CPSF30 still allows one copy of hFip1 to bind, while mutation of both sites abrogates binding. Our fluorescence polarization binding assays show that ZF4 has higher affinity for hFip1, with a Kd of 1.8 nM. We also demonstrate that two copies of the catalytic module of poly(A) polymerase (PAP) are recruited by the CPSF30-hFip1 complex in vitro, and both hFip1 binding sites in CPSF30 can support polyadenylation.;polyalanine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
1850;3502239;Proliferative response of T lymphocytes to a proline-rich polypeptide (PRP): PRP mimics mitogenic activity of Il-1.;Mitogenic properties of a proline-rich polypeptide were investigated. The mitogenic action of PRP was compared with the mitogenic action of Il-1. PRP was not mitogenic for thymocytes at doses 0.01-50 micrograms/ml. PRP, at doses 0.1-50 micrograms/ml, augmented the proliferative response of thymocytes to Con A in a similar fashion as Il-1. At doses higher than 10 micrograms/ml, PRP induced proliferation of lymph node cells and splenocytes as well as T cells from the lymph nodes. It did not, however, cause significant proliferation of B cells from the lymph nodes, at the doses used. PRP did not induce proliferation of an antigen specific Lyt 1+ T cell clone. Il-1 behaved in a similar way as PRP in all the tests described. We consider a possibility that under physiological conditions, at a very early stage of postneonatal life, PRP may replace some functions of Il-1. ;polyproline;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
1854;8770364;The cbl oncogene: a novel substrate of protein tyrosine kinases.;The cbl oncogene was first identified as part of a transforming retrovirus which arose in a mouse pre-B cell lymphoma. Its protein product, p120cbl, is cytoplasmic and has several distinctive domains including a highly basic region, a RING finger motif and a large proline-rich domain. A mutation to cbl in the 70Z/3 pre-B cell lymphoma produces an oncogenic protein which exhibits a marked enhancement of tyrosine phosphorylation. Parallel studies have demonstrated that p120cbl is a substrate of protein Tyrosine kinases activated by engagement of the T cell antigen receptor and that cbl is phosphorylated by oncogenic forms of the Abl tyrosine kinase. These studies also demonstrated a constitutive association between cbl and the SHS domains of the Grb2 and Nck adaptor proteins in a range of haemopoietic cell lines. More recently it has been found that cbl is rapidly phosphorylated following stimulation of the EGF receptor, Fcy receptor, c-Kit receptor and CSF-1 receptor. A genetic analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans has identified a cbl homologue, called sli-1, that negatively regulates the LET-23 tyrosine kinase receptor. These characteristics indicate a central role for cbl in the regulation of intracellular signals that are mediated by growth factors and antigenic stimuli which activate protein tyrosine kinases.;polyproline;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

New Perspectives of Nuclear Receptor Studies.;The superfamily of nuclear receptors (NRs), composed of ligand-activated transcription factors, is responsible for gene expression as a reaction to physiological and environmental changes. Transcriptional machinery may require phase separation to fulfil its role. Although NRs have a similar canonical structure, their C-terminal domains (F domains) are considered the least conserved and known regions. This article focuses on the peculiar molecular properties of the intrinsically disordered F domain of the ecdysteroid receptor from the Aedes aegypti mosquito (AaFEcR), the vector of the world's most devastating human diseases such as dengue and Zika. The His-Pro-rich segment of AaFEcR was recently shown to form the unique poly-proline helix II (PPII) in the presence of Cu2+. Here, using widefield microscopy of fluorescently labeled AaFEcR, Zn2+- and Cu2+-induced liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) was observed for the first time for the members of NRs.

1862;15283747;cAMP controls human renin mRNA stability via specific RNA-binding proteins.;It is now recognized that post-transcriptional mechanisms are pivotal to renin production. These involve factors that modulate renin mRNA stability. In 2003 new data has emerged from work in Australia and Germany that has identified several of the, as many as, 20 or so proteins involved. These include CP1 (hnRNP E1), HuR, HADHB, dynamin, nucleolin, YP-1, hnRNP K and MINT-homologous protein. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is a crucial regulator of renin secretion as well as transcriptional and post-transcriptional control of expression. Many of the RNA-binding proteins that were identified responded to forskolin, increasing in amount by two to 10-fold. The cAMP mechanisms that regulate renin mRNA target, at least in large part, other genes that presumably encode some of these proteins. The increase in the expression of these then facilitates, sequentially, renin mRNA stabilization and destabilization. Our data, using a battery of different techniques, confirm that CP1 and HuR stabilize renin mRNA, whereas HADHB causes destabilization. These proteins target cis-acting C-rich sequences (in the case of CP1) and AU-rich sequences (HuR) in the distal region of the 3'-untranslated region of renin mRNA. We found HADHB was enriched in juxtaglomerular cells and that that within Calu-6 cells HADHB, HuR and CP1 all localized in nuclear subregions, as well as cytoplasm (HADHB and CP1) and mitochondria (HADHB) commensurate with the role each plays in control of renin mRNA stability. The specific proteins that bind to human renin mRNA have begun to be revealed. Cyclic AMP upregulates the binding of several of these proteins, which in turn affect renin mRNA stability and thus overall expression of renin. ;polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

1867;27798850;Identification and molecular characterization of cellular factors required for glucocorticoid receptor-mediated mRNA decay.;Glucocorticoid (GC) receptor (GR) has been shown recently to bind a subset of mRNAs and elicit rapid mRNA degradation. However, the molecular details of GR-mediated mRNA decay (GMD) remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that GMD triggers rapid degradation of target mRNAs in a translation-independent and exon junction complex-independent manner, confirming that GMD is mechanistically distinct from nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Efficient GMD requires PNRC2 (proline-rich nuclear receptor coregulatory protein 2) binding, helicase ability, and ATM-mediated phosphorylation of UPF1 (upstream frameshift 1). We also identify two GMD-specific factors: an RNA-binding protein, YBX1 (Y-box-binding protein 1), and an endoribonuclease, HRSP12 (heat-responsive protein 12). In particular, using HRSP12 variants, which are known to disrupt trimerization of HRSP12, we show that HRSP12 plays an essential role in the formation of a functionally active GMD complex. Moreover, we determine the hierarchical recruitment of GMD factors to target mRNAs. Finally, our genome-wide analysis shows that GMD targets a variety of transcripts, implicating roles in a wide range of cellular processes, including immune responses. ;polyproline;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values were higher for the dipstick test than for the acridine orange staining compared with the thick blood smear. The sensitivity for the dipstick method was 86.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 82-90%), the specificity was 99.3% (95% CI = 98.5-99.7%), and the positive predictive value was 97.1% (95% CI = 94-98%) as compared with the thick blood smear. The sensitivity for acridine orange staining was 82.2% (95% CI = 77-86%), the specificity was 98.5% (95% CI = 97.6-99.1%), and the positive predictive value was 94.1% (95% CI = 90-97%); with a P. falciparum asexual parasitemia higher than 21 parasites/microliter, the dipstick was 100% sensitive, when parasitemia was 10-20/microliter, sensitivity was 88%, and when parasitemia was less than 10/microliter, it was only 13.4%. The dipstick assay meets the criteria for an appropriate, rapid, and reliable test for the diagnosis of P. falciparum and has advantages over the acridine orange staining method.

1873;7744361;[A neuroendocrinological study on the mechanism of feeding-associated circadian rhythm of plasma corticosterone and feeding behaviour in rats: a role of neuropeptide Y in the paraventricular nucleus].;Plasma corticosterone (CORT) level in rats increases before meal (pre-feeding peak), when rats are subjected to restricted daily feeding (RF), in which food is supplied only at a fixed time of day. Corticotropin-releasing hormones (CRH) release is also suggested to increase prior to meal. Cell bodies of CRH neurons exist in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) which receives neuropeptide Y (NPY) containing neurons of two different origins: one from the brainstem, in which catecholamine (CA) coexists, and the other from the arcuate nucleus (ARC). The aim of the present study is to examine the role of NPY neurons from the brainstem in feeding and CRH secretion. To accomplish this aim, NPY in the discrete areas of brain and in the extracellular space of the PVN were measured under ad-lib feeding, food deprivation, and RF, together with plasma CORT level. Under ad-lib feeding, NPY in the PVN didn't variate throughout the day. The extracellular NPY in the PVN, however, increased under food deprivation, which decreased rapidly after refeeding, and increased just before the daily meal under RF. And this preprandial increase reappeared by 3 day food deprivation even after RF was terminated and replaced by ad-lib feeding for 7 days. The preprandial increase was suppressed by 6-hydroxy-dopamine (6-OHDA), a CA deprivator, injected into the PVN or the ascending bundle of noradrenaline fibers. It is concluded that, (1) the NPY neurons in the PVN aren't involved in the regulation of plasma CORT level and feeding behavior under ad-lib feeding, but involved under food deprivation, (2) the prefeeding increase of the extracellular NPY in the PVN is an expression of a feeding-associated circadian oscillation under RF. By contrast, the prandial decrease in the extracellular NPY is a result of food intake, (3) the noradrenergic neurons innervating the PVN are important for the expression of the prefeeding NPY peak under RF.;-;-;-;hard_0

1875;1721701;Diversity of a ribonucleoprotein family in tobacco chloroplasts: two new chloroplast ribonucleoproteins and a phylogenetic tree of ten chloroplast RNA-binding domains.;Two new ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) have been identified from a tobacco chloroplast lysate. These two proteins (cp29A and cp29B) are nuclear-encoded and have a less affinity to single-stranded DNA as compared with three other chloroplast RNPs (cp28, cp31 and cp33) previously isolated. DNA sequencing revealed that both contain two consensus sequence-type homologous RNA-binding domains (CS-RBDs) and a very acidic amino-terminal domain but shorter than that of cp28, cp31 and cp33. Comparison of cp29A and cp29B showed a 19 amino acid insertion in the region separating the two CS-RBDs in cp29B. This insertion results in three tandem repeats of a glycine-rich sequence of 10 amino acids, which is a novel feature in RNPs. The two proteins are encoded by different single nuclear genes and no alternatively spliced transcripts could be identified. We constructed a phylogenetic tree for the ten chloroplast CS-RBDs. These results suggest that there is a sizable RNP family in chloroplasts and the diversity was mainly generated through a series of gene duplications rather than through alternative pre-mRNA splicing. The gene for cp29B contains three introns. The first and second introns interrupt the first CS-RBD and the third intron does the second CS-RBD. The position of the first intron site is the same as that in the human hnRNP A1 protein gene.; polyglycine ;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Another dose was given after an interval of 8 hours if body temperature continued to exceed 38.0 degrees C. Among the 452 patients with febrile seizures who visited our hospital from Jan. 1993 to Jun. 1995, 113 were studied who had at least one febrile episode in the follow-up period that extended over 6 months. These patients were divided into two groups: Group D (72 patients given diazepam) and Group C (41 patients given chloral hydrate). In group D and C, the numbers of febrile episodes were 238 and 167, and those of recurrent seizures 8 (3.8%) and 29 (20.4%), respectively. The recurrences rate was significantly higher in the latter group (p < 0.005).

In contrast to other elements it was generally thought that the transcription factor Sp1 is the only factor acting through these motifs. The cloning of paralogous genes of the Sp1 factor uncovered the existence of a small protein family consisting of Sp1, Sp2, Sp3 and Sp4. All four proteins exhibit very similar structural features. They contain a highly conserved DNA-binding domain composed of three zinc fingers close the C-terminus and serine/threonine- and glutamine-rich domains in their N-terminal regions. The high degree of structural conservation between these four proteins suggested that they do exert similar functions. Molecular, genetic and biochemical analyses, however, demonstrated that Sp2, Sp3 and Sp4 are not simply functional equivalents of Sp1. Here, I will summarize and discuss recent advances which have been made towards understanding the mode of action and biological function of individual family members. ;polyglutamine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
1880;7065484;Effect of flunarizine on canine cerebral cortical blood flow and vascular resistance post cardiac arrest.;Twelve dogs were anesthetized and instrumental for determination of CVP, arterial pressure, intracranial pressure, left atrial pressure, and frontal cerebral cortical blood flow (CCBF) by the thermal method. A catheter was introduced into the venous return of the cerebral confluence to allow determination of cerebral A-V oxygen saturation differences. The animals were placed on cardiac bypass using a circuit from the right atrium to the pulmonary artery and a second circuit from the left ventricular apex to the left femoral artery. A heat exchanger was used to maintain a constant blood temperature of 37 C in the output of the left side bypass circuit. All animals were heparinized during bypass. Ventricular fibrillation was induced after completion of the bypass surgery. Two dogs served as controls. Pre-arrest determinations of hemoglobin, glucose, CCBF, and cerebral A-V oxygen differences were taken. Full circulatory arrest was carried out for 20 minutes by shutting off the cardiac bypass. Resuscitation was achieved by resumption of bypass perfusion. Acid-base balance was corrected quickly, and pre-arrest perfusion pressure was achieved and maintained for 90 minutes. All pressure parameters were monitored continuously. All pre-arrest determinations were repeated at 20, 40, 60, and 90 minutes post resuscitation. Five dogs were treated with 6 microgram/kg flunarizine administered IV drip over 10 minutes immediately post reperfusion. Five dogs were not treated post arrest. Treated animals had a prompt return of CCBF rates equal to or greater than pre-arrest flow, which persisted throughout the period of post-arrest observation. Untreated animals had markedly reduced CCBF and increased resistance. CCBF uniformly proceeded to near zero flow by 90 minutes. The ICP was not significantly altered by treatment.;-;-;-;hard_0
1881;7565748;Isolation of a gene encoding a functional zinc finger protein homologous to erythroid Kr�ppel-like factor: identification of a new multigene family.;We have identified and characterized the gene for a novel zinc finger transcription factor which we have termed lung Kr�ppel-like factor (LKLF). LKLF was isolated through the use of the zinc finger domain of erythroid Kr�ppel-like factor (ELKF) as a hybridization probe and is closely related to this erythroid cell-specific gene. LKLF is expressed in a limited number of tissues, with the predominant expression seen in the lungs and spleen. The gene is developmentally controlled, with expression noted in the 7-day embryo followed by a down-regulation at 11 days and subsequent reactivation. A high degree of similarity is noted in the zinc finger regions of LKLF and EKLF. Beyond this domain, the sequences diverge significantly, although the putative transactivation domains for both LKLF and EKLF are proline-rich regions. In the DNA-binding domain, the three zinc finger motifs are so closely conserved that the predicted DNA contact sites are identical, suggesting that both proteins may bind to the same core sequence. This was further suggested by transactivation assays in which mouse fibroblasts were transiently transfected with a human beta-globin reporter gene in the absence and presence of an LKLF cDNA construct. Expression of the LKLF gene activates this human beta-globin promoter containing the CACCC sequence previously shown to be a binding site for EKLF. Mutation of this potential binding site results in a significant reduction in the reporter gene expression. LKLF and EKLF can thus be grouped as members of a unique family of transcription factors which have discrete patterns of expression in different tissues and which appear to recognize the same DNA-binding site. ;polyproline;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function

1891;1665090;Conformational analysis of a IgG1 hinge peptide derivative in solution determined by NMR spectroscopy and refined by restrained molecular dynamics simulations.;The hinge region links the antigen binding Fab part to the constant Fc domain in immunoglobulins. For the hinge peptide derivative [AcThr(OtBu)-Cys-Pro-Pro-Cys-Pro-Ala-ProNH2]2 the assignment of the 1H and 13C resonances was achieved by two-dimensional nmr techniques: total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY), nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY), rotating frame nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (ROESY), heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC) transfer, and a HSQC (modified Overbodenhausen experiment) with high resolution in F1, which was several times folded in F1 but still phase correctable. Conformational relevant parameters (78 nuclear Overhauser effect distance restraints, 3JHH for prochiral assignments, temperature gradients) were determined by nmr and served as input data for molecular dynamics (MD) structure refinement. A simulated model compound corresponding to the [Cys-Pro-Pro-Cys]2 core elongated by the peptide chains in the Fab and Fc direction served as a starting structure for the final MD run. The conformation calculated in in vacuo does not agree with the C2 symmetry required from nmr data, but the structure obtained by a water simulation fulfills the requirement. Here the core of the hinge peptide derivative adopts a polyproline II double helix as in the x-ray structure of IgG1. Hence, segments responsible for the internal flexibility are located outside the core as confirmed by the flexibility of the solvent exposed C termini.;polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function
1897;32973836;SgRVE6, a LHY-CCA1-Like Transcription Factor From Fine-Stem Stylo, Upregulates NB-LRR Gene Expression and Enhances Cold Tolerance in Tobacco.;Stylosanthes species are economically important tropical and subtropical forage legumes which are generally vulnerable to chilling and frost. Fine-stem stylo (S. guianensis var. intermedia) has the most superior cold tolerance among all stylo species. A REVEILLE (RVE) gene, SgRVE6, was cloned from fine-stem stylo. Bioinformatic analysis suggests that SgRVE6 encodes a transcription factor of 292 amino acid residues, which belongs to the LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL/CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1-LIKE (LCL) subgroup of RVE family and contains a SHAQKYF-class MYB domain and a LCL domain. SgRVE6 is universally expressed in root, stem and leaf tissues of fine-stem stylo and is rapidly up-regulated in all tested tissues under cold stress. Over-expressing SgRVE6 affects expression of 21 circadian clock genes, up-regulates expression of 6 nucleotide binding domain leucine-rich repeats (NB-LRR) encoding genes associated with tobacco cold tolerance, improves physiological responses to low temperature, and endows the transgenic tobaccos with higher tolerance to cold stress.

1898;7769781;Determination of nalbuphine in drug abusers' urine.;Nalbuphine, chemically derived from the oxymorphone, is a potent analgesic with narcotic antagonist activity. Because of the limited availability of methamphetamine, the abuse of nalbuphine as an alternative for methamphetamine began in late 1991 in Korea. In this study, the analysis of nalbuphine by gas chromatography (GC) was investigated. Using solid-phase extraction, we analyzed drug abusers' urine samples in order to quantitate nalbuphine by GC after trimethylsilyl derivatization with N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (MSTFA), trimethylsilylimidazole (TSIM), and 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) (100:2:5). Nalbuphine and its two metabolites, nornalbuphine and 6-ketonalbuphine, were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The ratio of total (i.e., nonconjugated and glucuronide) nalbuphine to nonconjugated nalbuphine ranged from 1.8 to 3.0 in the five drug abusers' urine. The urinary excretion of nalbuphine showed that 93% of nalbuphine was excreted in 6 h after intraperitoneal administration of 10 mg/kg nalbuphine to five rats. No nalbuphine was detected in the urine specimens of rats from 24 to 48 h.;-;-;-;hard_0
1902;7769424;Identification of viable myocardium with technetium-99m-MIBI infusion.;A 50-yr-old man was evaluated using standard stress/rest 99mTc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (MIBI) perfusion imaging, rest thallium infusion imaging and rest 99mTc-MIBI infusion imaging prior to revascularization. Resting 99mTc-MIBI infusion imaging demonstrated hibernating myocardium which was not detected with standard stress/rest 99mTc-MIBI imaging. The implication from this observation is that resting 99mTc-MIBI infusion scintigraphy can provide useful information when evaluating patients for the presence of hibernating myocardium.

1903;8741994;N epsilon-cyclosuccinyllysine: synthesis and formation from hemisuccinylated polylysine and its hapten conjugates with sulfamethoxazole during acid hydrolysis.;The novel amino acid N epsilon-cyclosuccinyllysine (4) forms as a side reaction during acid hydrolysis of N epsilon-hemisuccinylated succinylsulfamethoxazole-polylysine conjugates. The presence of 4 in hydrolysates can be obscured in amino acid analysis. Identification of 4 was based on chromatographic and electrophoretic comparisons with authentic N epsilon-cyclosuccinyllysine, which was synthesized in high yield by acid-catalyzed ring closure, under anhydrous conditions, of N epsilon-hemisuccinyl-L-lysine. The latter was prepared by an improved route, starting from N-alpha-(tert-butyloxycarbonyl)-L-lysine. The amount of 4 formed is influenced by the extent of succinylation and the conditions of hydrolysis and has reached 30 mol % of lysine. Both the hemisuccinyllysyl and the haptenized succinyllysyl residues participate in cyclization. This was confirmed by the synthesis and hydrolytic behavior of hemisuccinylated polylysine (n = 16) and N4,N epsilon-succinyl(sulfamethoxazole)(lysine). Formation of 4 can result in error in the estimation of the degree of ligand substitution based on lysine content in synthetic hemisuccinylated skin test antigens and peptide immunogens, especially when the degree of epitope substitution is low. 4 appears to be sufficiently stable for trial as an amino acid surrogate.;polylysine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
1904;9514727;SH3 in muscles: solution structure of the SH3 domain from nebulin.;The huge modular protein nebulin is located in the thin filament of striated muscle in vertebrates and is thought to bind and stabilize F-actin. The C-terminal part of human nebulin is anchored in the sarcomeric Z-disk and contains an SH3 domain, the first of such motifs to be identified in a myofibrillar protein. We have determined the nebulin SH3 sequence from several species and found it strikingly conserved. We have also shown that the SH3 transcripts are constitutively expressed in skeletal muscle tissues. As the first step towards a molecular understanding of nebulin's cellular role we have determined the three-dimensional structure of the human nebulin SH3 domain in solution by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and compared it with other known SH3 structures. The nebulin SH3 domain has a well-defined structure in solution with a typical SH3 topology, consisting of a beta-sandwich of two triple-stranded, antiparallel beta-sheets arranged at right angles to each other and of a single turn of a 310-helix. An additional double-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet in the RT loop bends over the beta-sandwich. The derived structure reveals a remarkable similarity with a distinct subset of SH3 domains, especially in the structural features of the exposed hydrophobic patch that is thought to be the site of interaction with polyproline ligands. On the basis of this similarity, we have modelled the interaction with an appropriate polyproline ligand and attempted to delineate the characteristics of the physiological SH3-binding partner in the Z-disk. Our results represent the first step in reconstructing the structure of nebulin and are expected to contribute to our understanding of nebulin's functional role in myofibrillar assembly. ;polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function

1912;22203960;Aire unleashes stalled RNA polymerase to induce ectopic gene expression in thymic epithelial cells.;Aire is a transcriptional regulator that induces expression of peripheral tissue antigens (PTA) in thymic medullary epithelial cells (MECs), driving immunological self-tolerance in differentiating T cells. To elucidate its mechanistic pathways, we examined its transcriptional impact in MECs in vivo by microarray analysis with mRNA-spanning probes. This analysis revealed initiation of Aire-activated genes to be comparable in Aire-deficient and wild-type MECs, but with a block to elongation after 50-100 bp in the absence of Aire, suggesting activation by release of stalled polymerases by Aire. In contrast, patterns of activation by transcription factors such as Klf4 were consistent with regulation of initiation. Mapping of Aire and RNA polymerase-II (Pol-II) by ChIP and high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed that Aire bound all Pol-II-rich transcriptional start sites (TSS), irrespective of its eventual effect. However, the genes it preferentially activated were characterized by a relative surfeit of stalled polymerases at the TSS, which resolved once Aire was introduced into cells. Thus, transcript mapping and ChIP-seq data indicate that Aire activates ectopic transcription not through specific recognition of PTA gene promoters but by releasing stalled polymerases. ;polyisoleucine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
1913;25479590;Flightless-1, a novel transcriptional modulator of PPARγ through competing with RXRα.;Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is a member of the nuclear receptor family and plays key roles in glucose and lipid metabolism. Its transcriptional control of target genes is mediated by ligand-dependent recruitment of coactivators. In this study, we demonstrate that a novel transcriptional modulator of PPARγ, Flightless-I (FLII) binds directly to and suppresses the transcriptional activity of PPARγ. The LXXLL motif within the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of FLII interacts directly with the DNA-binding domain of PPARγ. Interestingly, in the presence of PPARγ ligands, such as rosiglitazone and SR1664, this interaction was abolished in vitro. When FLII was overexpressed, both the transcriptional activity of PPARγ and adipogenesis were suppressed significantly, whereas specific knockdown of FLII reversed these effects. Furthermore, DNA occupancy of PPARγ on its target gene promoters was enhanced by FLII knockdown, and the interaction between PPARγ and retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) was blocked by FLII. Together, these findings strongly suggest that FLII functions in PPARγ activation as a molecular switch to repress transcriptional activity by interrupting formation of the PPARγ/RXRα complex, and FLII may serve as a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of adiposity-related metabolic syndromes.  ;polyleucine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
1914;26269198;Sulforaphane inhibits multiple inflammasomes through an Nrf2-independent mechanism.;The inflammasomes are intracellular complexes that have an important role in cytosolic innate immune sensing and pathogen defense. Inflammasome sensors detect a diversity of intracellular microbial ligands and endogenous danger signals and activate caspase-1, thus initiating maturation and release of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β and interleukin-18. These events, although crucial to the innate immune response, have also been linked to the pathology of several inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. The natural isothiocyanate sulforaphane, present in broccoli sprouts and available as a dietary supplement, has gained attention for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and chemopreventive properties. We discovered that sulforaphane inhibits caspase-1 autoproteolytic activation and interleukin-1β maturation and secretion downstream of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor leucine-rich repeat proteins NLRP1 and NLRP3, NLR family apoptosis inhibitory protein 5/NLR family caspase-1 recruitment domain-containing protein 4 (NAIP5/NLRC4), and absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome receptors. Sulforaphane does not inhibit the inflammasome by direct modification of active caspase-1 and its mechanism is not dependent on protein degradation by the proteasome or de novo protein synthesis. Furthermore, sulforaphane-mediated inhibition of the inflammasomes is independent of the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like factor 2 (Nrf2) and the antioxidant response-element pathway, to which many of the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of sulforaphane have been attributed. Sulforaphane was also found to inhibit cell recruitment to the peritoneum and interleukin-1β secretion in an in vivo peritonitis model of acute gout and to reverse NLRP1-mediated murine resistance to Bacillus anthracis spore infection. These findings demonstrate that sulforaphane inhibits the inflammasomes through a novel mechanism and contributes to our understanding of the beneficial effects of sulforaphane.  ;polyleucine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
1923;16440369;C/EBPalpha and HNF6 protein complex formation stimulates HNF6-dependent transcription by CBP coactivator recruitment in HepG2 cells.;We previously demonstrated that formation of complexes between the DNA-binding domains of hepatocyte nuclear factor 6 (HNF6) and forkhead box a2 (Foxa2) proteins stimulated Foxa2 transcriptional activity. Here, we used HepG2 cell cotransfection assays to demonstrate that HNF6 transcriptional activity was stimulated by CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha), but not by the related C/EBPbeta or C/EBPdelta proteins. Formation of the C/EBPalpha-HNF6 protein complex required the HNF6 cut domain and the C/EBPalpha activation domain (AD) 1/AD2 sequences. This C/EBPalpha-HNF6 transcriptional synergy required both the N-terminal HNF6 polyhistidine and serine/threonine/proline box sequences, as well as the C/EBPalpha AD1/AD2 sequences, the latter of which are known to recruit the CREB binding protein (CBP) transcriptional coactivator. Consistent with these findings, adenovirus E1A-mediated inhibition of p300/CBP histone acetyltransferase activity abrogated C/EBPalpha-HNF6 transcriptional synergy in cotransfection assays. Co-immunoprecipitation assays with liver protein extracts demonstrate an association between the HNF6 and C/EBPalpha transcription factors and the CBP coactivator protein in vivo. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with hepatoma cells demonstrated that increased levels of both C/EBPalpha and HNF6 proteins were required to stimulate association of these transcription factors and the CBP coactivator protein with the endogenous mouse Foxa2 promoter region. In conclusion, formation of the C/EBPalpha-HNF6 protein complex stimulates recruitment of the CBP coactivator protein for expression of Foxa2, a transcription factor critical for regulating expression of hepatic gluconeogenic genes during fasting. ;polyhistidine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
1924;30395636;Basal autophagy is required for promoting dendritic terminal branching in Drosophila sensory neurons.;Dendrites function as the primary sites for synaptic input and integration with impairments in dendritic arborization being associated with dysfunctional neuronal circuitry. Post-mitotic neurons require high levels of basal autophagy to clear cytotoxic materials and autophagic dysfunction under native or cellular stress conditions has been linked to neuronal cell death as well as axo-dendritic degeneration. However, relatively little is known regarding the developmental role of basal autophagy in directing aspects of dendritic arborization or the mechanisms by which the autophagic machinery may be transcriptionally regulated to promote dendritic diversification. We demonstrate that autophagy-related (Atg) genes are positively regulated by the homeodomain transcription factor Cut, and that basal autophagy functions as a downstream effector pathway for Cut-mediated dendritic terminal branching in Drosophila multidendritic (md) sensory neurons. Further, loss of function analyses implicate Atg genes in promoting cell type-specific dendritic arborization and terminal branching, while gain of function studies suggest that excessive autophagy leads to dramatic reductions in dendritic complexity. We demonstrate that the Atg1 initiator kinase interacts with the dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) pathway by negatively regulating the E3 ubiquitin ligase Highwire and positively regulating the MAPKKK Wallenda. Finally, autophagic induction partially rescues dendritic atrophy defects observed in a model of polyglutamine toxicity. Collectively, these studies implicate transcriptional control of basal autophagy in directing dendritic terminal branching and demonstrate the importance of homeostatic control of autophagic levels for dendritic arbor complexity under native or cellular stress conditions. ;polyglutamine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

As microspore embryogenesis closely resembles zygotic embryogenesis, it is used as model for studying the molecular mechanisms controlling embryo formation. A previous study comparing the transcriptomes of three-day-old sorted embryogenic and pollen-like (non-embryogenic) microspores identified a gene homologous to AT1G74730 of unknown function that was upregulated 8-fold in the embryogenic cells. In the current study, the gene was isolated and sequenced from B. napus and named BnMicEmUP (B. napus microspore embryogenesis upregulated gene). Four forms of BnMicEmUP mRNA and three forms of genomic DNA were identified. BnMicEmUP2,3 was upregulated more than 7-fold by day 3 in embryogenic microspore cultures compared to non-induced cultures. BnMicEmUP1,4 was highly expressed in leaves. Transient expression studies of BnMicEmUP3::GFP fusion protein in Nicotiana benthamiana and in stable Arabidopsis transgenics showed that it accumulates in chloroplasts. The features of the BnMicEmUP protein, which include a chloroplast targeting region, a basic region, and a large region containing 11 complete leucine-rich repeats, suggest that it is similar to a bZIP PEND (plastid envelope DNA-binding protein) protein, a DNA binding protein found in the inner envelope membrane of developing chloroplasts. Here, we report that the BnMicEmUP3 overexpression in Arabidopsis increases the sensitivity of seedlings to exogenous abscisic acid (ABA). The BnMicEmUP proteins appear to be transcription factors that are localized in plastids and are involved in plant responses to biotic and abiotic environmental stresses; as well as the results obtained from this study can be used to improve crop yield.";polyleucine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

In addition, data were collected from 12 patients in optimal control (O group). Prior to treatment the patients in poor control were rated higher than those in the O group for symptoms indicating somatization and internalization of conflict and showed a gloomier self-image. The O group patients had fewer behavioural symptoms and a more positive self-image than non-diabetic reference groups. Diabetic control improved after family therapy only. Furthermore, the family therapy group improved on a combined measure of behavioural symptoms and one aspect of self-evaluation (relations to parents and family). The results suggest that IDDM may either interfere with or foster the child's development towards autonomy, depending on family interaction patterns which affect the child's behaviour and self-esteem. Family therapy is a treatment option which can mediate improved diabetic control by changing family relationships to allow for a better balance between parental and self-care of the child with poorly controlled IDDM.;-;-;-;hard_0

1948;7490751;Comparison between the phi distribution of the amino acids in the protein database and NMR data indicates that amino acids have various phi propensities in the random coil conformation.;It has been indicated that amino acids have various intrinsic phi and psi propensities, as demonstrated from the comparison between experimental secondary structure propensities and their relative statistical distribution in the protein database for the appropriate region of the Ramachandran plot. However, this does not eliminate the possibility that these experimental propensities are the result of context effects due to the secondary structure environment of the mutated position. To demonstrate that there are at least real intrinsic phi propensities, independent of context effects, we have used two different nuclear magnetic resonance parameters related to the phi dihedral angle (J3 alpha HN coupling constants and the chemical shift of the C alpha H proton), determined in random-coil tetra- and pentapeptides, and/or in proteins. Comparison of the experimentally determined values for these parameters with the theoretical ones determined from the analysis by different empirical and theoretical equations of the phi dihedral angle statistical distribution of the amino acids in the protein database, supports the idea that each amino acid has, at least, different phi intrinsic propensities. Consideration of all conformations, or only coil conformations, in the protein database produces similar results. The reasonable correlation between these experimental and theoretical data and the hydrogen-exchange data in random-coil peptides suggests that maximisation of hydrophobic surface-buried and hydrogen-bond formation with the solvent could be responsible for these different random-coil conformational preferences. Analysis of the intrinsic propensities for beta-strand, alpha-helix and polyproline II dihedral angles of the 20 amino acids in coil conformations, indicates that the side-chain of the amino acids is mainly determining the relative preferences for the phi angle.;polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function
1951;3015926;Mechanism of interaction between Ku protein and DNA.;The mechanism of interaction between the Ku autoantigenic protein, a heterodimer of noncovalently linked 70,000- and 80,000-dalton subunits, and DNA was studied using immunoaffinity-purified Ku protein and a 300-base pair EcoRI fragment from HeLa cell DNA. In the nitrocellulose filter-binding assay, the Ku protein bound 32P-labeled double-stranded DNA, and much less efficiently single-stranded DNA. The binding of Ku to DNA was dependent on ionic strength and prevented by IgG from patient sera containing anti-Ku antibodies. In competitive assays, using unlabeled nucleic acid competitors, the DNA binding of Ku was not inhibited in the presence of yeast tRNA, synthetic copolymer of poly(A)-poly(dT), or circular plasmid pBR322 DNA, but was inhibited when the plasmid DNA was cleaved with appropriate restriction endonucleases. The inhibitory activities of cleaved plasmid DNA were independent of the configuration or nucleotide sequences at ends but proportional to the number of recognition sites of restriction enzymes used. Footprint analysis demonstrated that Ku protein protected both 3'- and 5'-terminal regions of double-stranded DNA from DNase I digestion. When Ku protein was fractionated electrophoretically, transferred to nitrocellulose filter, and probed with 32P-labeled DNA, only the 70,000-dalton subunit exhibited DNA binding. Thus, the Ku protein appears to recognize selectively ends of double-stranded DNA molecules. Possible functions of the Ku autoantigen in eukaryotic cells are discussed. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
1956;35176105;Insights into POT1 structural dynamics revealed by cryo-EM.;Telomeres are protein-DNA complexes that protect the ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes. Mammalian telomeric DNA consists of 5'-(TTAGGG)n-3' double-stranded repeats, followed by up to several hundred bases of a 3' single-stranded G-rich overhang. The G-rich overhang is bound by the shelterin component POT1 which interacts with TPP1, the component involved in telomerase recruitment. A previously published crystal structure of the POT1 N-terminal half bound to the high affinity telomeric ligand 5'-TTAGGGTTAG-3' showed that the first six nucleotides, TTAGGG, are bound by the OB1 fold, while the adjacent OB2 binds the last four, TTAG. Here, we report two cryo-EM structures of full-length POT1 bound by the POT1-binding domain of TPP1. The structures differ in the relative orientation of the POT1 OB1 and OB2, suggesting that these two DNA-binding OB folds take up alternative conformations. Supporting DNA binding studies using telomeric ligands in which the OB1 and OB2 binding sites were spaced apart, show that POT1 binds with similar affinities to spaced or contiguous binding sites, suggesting plasticity in DNA binding and a role for the alternative conformations observed. A likely explanation is that the structural flexibility of POT1 enhances binding to the tandemly arranged telomeric repeats and hence increases telomere protection.;polyglycine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Extracellular ATP induced elevation of [Ca2+]i in type I SGCs in a concentration-dependent manner. The ATP-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i in SGC was even evident in the Ca(2+)-free solution, thereby suggesting that ATP induces a Ca(2+)-release from intracellular stores in SGCs. Suramin and reactive blue 2, both antagonists for the P2-purinergic receptor, inhibited the [Ca2+]i increase in SGCs induced by extracellular ATP in a dose-dependent manner. Adenosine did not induce any changes of [Ca2+]i in SGC. These results suggest that type I SGCs may possess P2-purinergic receptor but not P1-purinergic receptor. Extracellular ATP induced a [Ca2+]i increase in type I SGCs, with and without neuritic processes, while L-glutamate increased [Ca2+]i in type I SGCs with neuritic processes, but not SGCs without neuritic processes. The ATP-induced [Ca2+]i increase was almost equal in both soma and processes. Therefore, the distribution of P2-purinergic receptor in type I SGCs may be homogeneous in soma and processes. Based on these observations, we suggest that extracellular ATP may act as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator of the hair cell-afferent nerve synapse in the guinea pig cochlea.;-;-;-;hard_0

ECOG is committed to the performance of intergroup trials that are coordinated among the other major cooperative clinical trials groups in order to accrue the large numbers of patients required for optimal definition of trial results in as few years as possible. Most adjuvant trials to begin the months and years ahead will involve such collaboration. Issues to be addressed include the adjuvant benefit of ovarian ablation (surgical or medical) in addition to tamoxifen in the adjuvant therapy of women at relatively low risk; the significance of increasing dose intensity by a variety of techniques for the adjuvant therapy of women at higher risk of recurrence, including the use of autologous bone marrow transplantation and stem cell support with dose-intense therapy for women at the highest risk of recurrence; and the issue of combination scheduling of cytotoxic agents versus sequential single agents at higher dose intensity.";-;-;-;hard_0

The samples were from 25 brains obtained at autopsy from patients who had senile dementia of Alzheimer's type (SDAT) (60 to 97 years old) and 10 brains from non-demented elderly subjects (75 to 101 years old). Proteoglycan levels in the brains of patients with SDAT were twice as high in the hippocampus and four times higher in the superior frontal gyrus than the levels in brains of non-demented elderly subjects. The content of heparan sulfate proteoglycan was greatest nine times higher in the hippocampus and seven times higher in the superior frontal gyrus. By immuno-electronmicroscopic examination, heparan sulfate proteoglycan was found in the basement membranes of capillaries, and in a portion of the cores of the senile plaques.;-;-;-;hard_0
1971;9513660;Correlations among mucociliary transport, ciliary function, and ciliary structure.;Mucociliary transport is one of the most important defense mechanisms of the airway. Mucociliary transport time or rate, as measured using the saccharin test or the radioisotope technique, respectively, is clinically the most relevant parameter, although subject to large intra- and interindividual variability. There is no correlation between mucociliary transport in vivo and ciliary beat frequency ex vivo. Preliminary evidence demonstrates that mucociliary transport correlates with ciliary structure and orientation as investigated with transmission and scanning electron microscopy. A correlation is presented between ciliary beat frequency and secondary ciliary abnormalities. This correlation can best be described according to the logistic sigmoid model (r = 0.69). Based on these functional data, an ultrastructural distinction is proposed among normal (less than 5%), light (5 to 15%), moderate (15 to 25%), and severe (more than 25%) secondary ciliary dyskinesia.;-;-;-;hard_0

1982;2883234;The interleukin 1 gene is expressed by rat glomerular mesangial cells and is augmented in immune complex glomerulonephritis.;"Cultured rat mesangial cells have features of immune effector cells that may contribute to the derangements in glomerulonephritis. Recent reports have demonstrated that mesangial cells produce a cytokine similar to interleukin 1 (IL 1). We predicted rat mesangial cells could express a gene homologous to murine macrophage IL 1. Mesangial cells were cultured by explant and were used in the fourth through sixth passages. Antibodies to desmin and fibronectin but not cytokeratin stained the cytoskeleton of all mesangial cells examined; no Ia+, leukocyte common antigen+ mononuclear phagocytes were present. RNA from mesangial cells and P388D macrophages hybridized in dot blots with a 32P-probe nick-translated from the murine IL 1 cDNA. Mesangial cells but not Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts contained IL 1 mRNA transcripts that co-migrated with the 2.0 kb message from murine P388D macrophages by Northern analysis of poly(A) RNA. In situ hybridization of cultured cells demonstrated specific hybridization of 3H-IL 1 probe to cells with the morphology of contractile mesangial cells and P388D cells but not 3T3 cells. IL 1 release is an important mediator of local inflammation and injury. Therefore we compared the expression of the IL 1 gene in total RNA from kidneys of rats with immune complex glomerulonephritis with that extracted from kidneys of healthy rats. Glomerulonephritic kidneys contain a twofold to threefold increase in IL 1 mRNA compared with normals. We conclude that rat mesangial cells express mRNA with significant homology to murine macrophage IL 1 mRNA and further suggest that local production of the potent phlogistic mediator IL 1 may be important in the pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis."; polyalanine ;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
1984;1789799;Bending of a highly repetitive component in rat nuclear DNA.;A highly repetitive component in rat nuclear DNA was isolated by HindIII digestion and cloned. A 370-bp cloned component was highly AT-rich (68.3%) in about one third of the region from the 3'-terminus and showed an anomalously slow gel electrophoretic mobility (k-factor = 1.19). These results indicated that a sequence-directed bending of the helix axis occurs in the component. Accordingly, a subclone containing a tandem dimer of the component was isolated and subjected to a circular permutation analysis for exploring the bend center (1). In consequence, the center was shown to be present in the sequence ranging from position near 270 to the 3'-terminus and estimated to be located around position 340.;polythreonine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
1985;30972750;Helical side chain chemistry of a peptoid-based SP-C analogue: Balancing structural rigidity and biomimicry.;"Surfactant protein C (SP-C) is an important constituent of lung surfactant (LS) and, along with SP-B, is included in exogenous surfactant replacement therapies for treating respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). SP-C's biophysical activity depends upon the presence of a rigid C-terminal helix, of which the secondary structure is more crucial to functionality than precise side-chain chemistry. SP-C is highly sequence-conserved, suggesting that the β-branched, aliphatic side chains of the helix are also important. Nonnatural mimics of SP-C were created using a poly-N-substituted glycine, or ""peptoid,"" backbone. The mimics included varying amounts of α-chiral, aliphatic side chains and α-chiral, aromatic side chains in the helical region, imparting either biomimicry or structural rigidity. Biophysical studies confirmed that the peptoids mimicked SP-C's secondary structure and replicated many of its surface-active characteristics. Surface activity was optimized by incorporating both structurally rigid and biomimetic side chain chemistries in the helical region indicating that both characteristics are important for activity. By balancing these features in one mimic, a novel analogue was created that emulates SP-C's in vitro surface activity while overcoming many of the challenges related to natural SP-C. Peptoid-based analogues hold great potential for use in a synthetic, biomimetic LS formulation for treating RDS. ";polyasparagine;helix;-;LCR_with_function

A total of 157 patients were examined within the first 2 to 6 hours after transmural infarction. The segments of the left ventricle which are mostly affected in infarctions of different sites were defined. Application of two-dimensional echocardiography permitted an earlier detecting of the segmental disorders and the extent of the focus of lesion as compared with the ECG. The method appeared particularly informative in the diagnosis of conduction impairment and repeated lesions of the left ventricular myocardium.

1987;9878426;DNA distortion and multimerization: novel functions of the glutamine-rich domain of GAGA factor.;"GAGA factor (GAF) is an essential protein in Drosophila melanogaster, important for the transcriptional regulation of numerous genes. The effect of GAF on chromatin structure and promoter function has been the subject of much attention, yet little is known of the actual mechanism and the specific contributions of individual GAF domains to its function. The DNA-binding activity of GAF, as specified by the single zinc finger binding domain (Zn), has been examined in some detail; however, the functions of the POZ/BTB and glutamine domain (Q) remain poorly understood. Here, we report three separate activities of the Q domain of GAF; promoter distortion, single-strand binding, and multimerization. In vitro, GAF binding to the hsp70 promoter produces extended DNase I protection and KMnO4 hypersensitivity. These activities require both the Zn domain and Q domain of GAF, and appear independent of the POZ/BTB domain. GAF also has a single-stranded DNA binding affinity, as does the Q-rich region alone. GAF forms multimers both in vitro and in vivo, and the Q domain itself forms multimers. Protein-protein interactions mediated by the Q domain may, therefore, be at least partially responsible for the multimerization capabilities of GAF. We discuss these findings in the context of their possible function in GAF mediated transcriptional regulation. ";polyglutamine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
1988;24316202;Colponemids represent multiple ancient alveolate lineages.;"The alveolates comprise three well-studied protist lineages of significant environmental, medical, and economical importance: apicomplexans (e.g., Plasmodium), dinoflagellates (e.g., Symbiodinium), and ciliates (e.g., Tetrahymena). These major lineages have evolved distinct and unusual characteristics, the origins of which have proved to be difficult evolutionary puzzles. Mitochondrial genomes are a prime example: all three groups depart from canonical form and content, but in different ways. Reconstructing such ancient transitions is difficult without deep-branching lineages that retain ancestral characteristics. Here we describe two such lineages and how they illuminate the ancestral state of alveolate mitochondrial genomes. We established five clonal cultures of colponemids, predatory alveolates without cultured representatives and molecular data. Colponemids represent at least two independent lineages at the phylum level in multilocus phylogenetic analysis; one sister to apicomplexans and dinoflagellates, and the other at a deeper position. A genome survey from one strain showed that ancestral state of the mitochondrial genomes in the three major alveolate lineages consisted of an unusual linear chromosome with telomeres and a substantially larger gene set than known alveolates. Colponemid sequences also identified several environmental lineages as colponemids, altogether suggesting an untapped potential for understanding the origin and evolution of apicomplexans, dinoflagellates, and ciliates.";-;-;-;hard_0
1989;8168913;Conserved sequence homology of cysteine-rich regions in genes encoding glycoprotein A in Pneumocystis carinii derived from different host species.;Pneumocystis carinii surface glycoprotein A (gpA) exhibits host species-specific phenotypic and genotypic variation. Despite this heterogeneity, the gpAs of P. carinii isolated from different host species appear to be homologous molecules sharing certain biochemical and antigenic characteristics. Using two degenerate oligodeoxyribonucleotide primers corresponding to conserved cysteine regions from ferret and rat P. carinii gpAs, a PCR product of approximately 300 bp was amplified from ferret, rat, and SCID mouse P. carinii-infected lung genomic DNA. Northern (RNA) hybridization revealed a transcript of 3,450 nucleotides in P. carinii-infected SCID mouse lung mRNA, which is similar in size to the transcripts for ferret and rat P. carinii gpAs. Nucleotide sequence analysis of SCID mouse P. carinii gpA subclones derived from the PCR products identified two isoforms, which were 89% identical to each other in the amplified region and 73 and 54% identical to the rat- and ferret-derived P. carinii gpA genes, respectively. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of mouse, ferret, and rat P. carinii gpAs revealed striking similarity in residues adjacent to and including the conserved cysteines. Furthermore, the spacing of two proline residues is invariant, and a potential N-linked glycosylation site is found at a similar position in all of the gpAs. Despite the heterogeneity observed in P. carinii gpAs, the conservation of cysteine residues and adjacent sequences implies similar secondary structure and, most likely, similar function for the gpAs of P. carinii isolated from different host species. ;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
1990;26311873;Selective Removal of FG Repeat Domains from the Nuclear Pore Complex by Enterovirus 2A(pro).;Enteroviruses proteolyze nuclear pore complex (NPC) proteins (Nups) during infection, leading to disruption of host nuclear transport pathways and alterations in nuclear permeability. To better understand how enteroviruses exert these effects on nuclear transport, the mechanisms and consequences of Nup98 proteolysis were examined. The results indicate that Nup98 is rapidly targeted for degradation following enterovirus infection and that this is mediated by the enterovirus 2A protease (2A(pro)). Incubation of bacterially expressed or in vitro-translated Nup98 with 2A(pro) results in proteolytic cleavage at multiple sites in vitro, indicating that 2A(pro) cleaves Nup98 directly. Site-directed mutagenesis of putative cleavage sites identified Gly374 and Gly552 as the sites of 2A(pro) proteolysis in Nup98 in vitro and in infected cells. Indirect immunofluorescence assays using an antibody that recognizes the N terminus of Nup98 revealed that proteolysis releases the N-terminal FG-rich region from the NPC. In contrast, similar analyses using an antibody to the C terminus indicated that this region is retained at the nuclear rim. Nup88, a core NPC component that serves as a docking site for Nup98, also remains at the NPC in infected cells. These findings support a model whereby the selective removal of Nup FG repeat domains leads to increased NPC permeability and inhibition of certain transport pathways, while retention of structural domains maintains the overall NPC structure and leaves other transport pathways unaffected. Enteroviruses are dependent upon host nuclear RNA binding proteins for efficient replication. This study examines the mechanisms responsible for alterations in nuclear transport in enterovirus-infected cells that lead to the cytoplasmic accumulation of these proteins. The results demonstrate that the enterovirus 2A protease directly cleaves the nuclear pore complex (NPC) protein, Nup98, at amino acid positions G374 and G552 both in vitro and in infected cells. Cleavage at these positions results in the selective removal of the FG-containing N terminus of Nup98 from the NPC, while the C terminus remains associated. Nup88, a core component of the NPC that serves as a docking site for the C terminus of Nup98, remains associated with the NPC in infected cells. These findings help to explain the alterations in permeability and nuclear transport in enterovirus-infected cells and how NPCs remain functional for certain trafficking pathways despite significant alterations to their compositions. ;polyglycine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

The mean values (+/- SD) detected in pretransplant sera were significantly higher (1932 +/- 1389 U/ml) than in 72 healthy adults (267 +/- 139 U/ml), but after transplantation they continuously fell towards normal levels within the first 3 postoperative weeks. Recipients with acute rejection episodes showed higher sIL-2R levels (1762 +/- 904 U/ml) than those with stable transplants at discharge (937 +/- 398 U/ml). Highest values were detected during antirejection therapy with antithymocyte globulin (4996 +/- 2166 U/ml) or OKT3 (5905 +/- 3910). Increases were also observed during bacterial and viral infections and even, in some cases, without any apparent cause. Because of this lack of specificity, elevated sIL-2R levels should be interpreted cautiously. Nevertheless, sIL-2R level can be useful for monitoring kidney allograft recipients. Increases point to a cellular immune activation process and can predict rejections or infections.;-;-;-;hard_0
1993;6382004;Cimetidine, cigarette smoking, and recurrence of duodenal ulcer.;"Three hundred seventy patients with recently healed duodenal ulcer entered into a one-year, double-blind, randomized multicenter trial comparing placebo with three different dose schedules of cimetidine (200 mg twice a day, 300 mg twice a day, and 400 mg at bedtime) for the prevention of recurrent duodenal ulcer. By the end of one year, the cumulative symptomatic recurrence rate as demonstrated by endoscopy was similar for the patients receiving the three dosages of cimetidine (19 per cent, 15 per cent, and 13 per cent, respectively; not significant), whereas the placebo-treated group had a 34.7 per cent symptomatic recurrence rate (P less than 0.01 as compared with each cimetidine group). Cigarette smoking was found to be an important variable; among the placebo recipients ulcer recurrence was significantly more likely in smokers (72 per cent) than in nonsmokers (21 per cent, P less than 0.001). The frequency of ulcer recurrence in smokers was significantly reduced by treatment with cimetidine (from 72 per cent to 34 per cent, P less than 0.). Smokers who received cimetidine were at least as likely to have a recurrence as were nonsmokers who received placebo (34 per cent vs. 21 per cent, not significant). Thus, smoking appears to be a major factor in recurrence of duodenal ulcer, and in smokers, giving up smoking may be more important in the prevention of ulcer recurrences than administration of cimetidine.";-;-;-;hard_0
1994;18589439;Structural basis of guanine nucleotide exchange mediated by the T-cell essential Vav1.;The guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Vav1 plays an important role in T-cell activation and tumorigenesis. In the GEF superfamily, Vav1 has the ability to interact with multiple families of Rho GTPases. The structure of the Vav1 DH-PH-CRD/Rac1 complex to 2.6 A resolution reveals a unique intramolecular network of contacts between the Vav1 cysteine-rich domain (CRD) and the C-terminal helix of the Vav1 Dbl homology (DH) domain. These unique interactions stabilize the Vav1 DH domain for its intimate association with the Switch II region of Rac1 that is critical for the displacement of the guanine nucleotide. Small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) studies support this domain arrangement for the complex in solution. Further, mutational analyses confirms that the atypical CRD is critical for maintaining both optimal guanine nucleotide exchange activity and broader specificity of Vav family GEFs. Taken together, the data outline the detailed nature of Vav1's ability to contact a range of Rho GTPases using a novel protein-protein interaction network. ;polycysteine;helix;-;LCR_with_function

1998;11477570;Binding of a SART3 tumor-rejection antigen to a pre-mRNA splicing factor RNPS1: a possible regulation of splicing by a complex formation.;We recently reported the identification of a human SART3 gene that encodes a tumor-rejection antigen recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). The squamous-cell carcinoma antigen recognized by T cells-3 (SART3) is an RNA-binding protein expressed in the nucleus of the majority of proliferating cells, including normal cells and malignant cells, but not in normal tissues except for the testes and fetal liver. To determine its biologic function, we employed a 2-hybrid screening in yeast for proteins interacting with SART3, and this method yielded a pre-mRNA splicing factor (RNA-binding protein prevalent during the S phase or RNA-binding protein with a serine-rich domain [RNPS1]) that activated both constitutive and alternative splicing of pre-mRNA in vitro. Interaction of SART3 with RNPS1 through the physical association of N-terminal domains of RNPS1 was confirmed by both in vitro pull-down assay and immunoprecipitation assay. Cotransfection of the 2 genes changed the distribution pattern of SART3 from diffuse nucleoplasmic spreading to nuclear speckled regions in which the RNPS1 was colocalized, suggesting a complex formation of the 2 proteins. In cooperation with RNPS1, SART3 stimulated the proximal alternative 3' splicing of a calcitonin-dihydrofolate reductase chimeric minigene pre-mRNA. These results suggest that SART3 is involved in the regulation of mRNA splicing probably via its complex formation with RNPS1. ;polyserine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
2001;6780722;Spatial structure of immunoglobulin molecules.;Immunoglobulin molecules of the class G (antibody molecules) consist of two heavy chains (50,000 dalton molecular weight) and two light chains (25,000 dalton). The overall shape is a Y with the arms formed by the light chains and the N-terminal half of the heavy chains in tight association. The stem is formed by the C-terminal halves of the heavy chains. The heavy and the light chains fold into globular domains of molecular weights of 12,000 dalton. There are four domains of the heavy chain and two of the light chain. All these domains show a similar fold, consisting of two B-sheets but display considerable differences in detail. The N-terminal variable domains of heavy and light chains and specifically the hypervariable polypeptide segments of the domains, located at the tips of the Y, constitute the antigen and hapten binding site. The nature of the amino acid residues of the hypervariable loops determines the shape and the specificity of the antibody. All domains pair tightly laterally, except the CH2 domains of the heavy chain. This domain has carbohydrate bound which prevents lateral association. Longitudinal interaction between the domains is loose and allows flexibility in the arrangement. Flexibility is probably of significance for antibody function. Arm (Fab) and stem (Fc) parts are linked by the hinge peptide which contains a segment with a unique conformation of two parallel poly-proline helices. Antigen binding triggers effector functions of antibodies. Antigen binding is at the tips of the Y-shaped antibody, but effector functions are displayed by the stem part.

2010;8194899;Detection of a putative 30-kDa ligand of the cluster-2 antigen.;The cluster-2 antigen, also called EGP-2, is a 38-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein with a distribution that is largely confined to human epithelial cells and their derived carcinomas. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against EGP-2 have been extensively studied as anti-tumor agents, yet the function of the antigen is not known. In the present study we used a biotinylated recombinant soluble derivative of the EGP-2 (sEGPbio) as a probe to detect a possible EGP-2 ligand, using various carcinoma cell lines as a substrate. The recombinant soluble EGP-2 was expressed in the Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (baculovirus) expression system. The sEGP-2, to which we engineered a poly-histidine affinity tag, was purified from infected Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells using immobilized metal-ion-affinity chromatography (IMAC). In Western blot analysis the sEGPbio probe bound to a 30-kDa protein band in 2 out of 5 of the assessed carcinoma cell lines, suggesting that this band may be an EGP-2 ligand. Interestingly, binding only occurred when, prior to SDS-PAGE, cell lysates had been subjected to a reducing agent (2-mercapto-ethanol). The physiological significance of this phenomenon and nature of the detected 30-kDa protein band remains to be determined.;polyhistidine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

2015;33357437;Nuclear Import Receptors Directly Bind to Arginine-Rich Dipeptide Repeat Proteins and Suppress Their Pathological Interactions.;Nuclear import receptors, also called importins, mediate nuclear import of proteins and chaperone aggregation-prone cargoes (e.g., neurodegeneration-linked RNA-binding proteins [RBPs]) in the cytoplasm. Importins were identified as modulators of cellular toxicity elicited by arginine-rich dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs), an aberrant protein species found in C9orf72-linked amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mechanistically, the link between importins and arginine-rich DPRs remains unclear. Here, we show that arginine-rich DPRs (poly-GR and poly-PR) bind directly to multiple importins and, in excess, promote their insolubility and condensation. In cells, poly-GR impairs Impα/β-mediated nuclear import, including import of TDP-43, an RBP that aggregates in C9orf72-ALS/FTD patients. Arginine-rich DPRs promote phase separation and insolubility of TDP-43 in vitro and in cells, and this pathological interaction is suppressed by elevating importin concentrations. Our findings suggest that importins can decrease toxicity of arginine-rich DPRs by suppressing their pathological interactions.;polyproline;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Forty-one shoulders were relieved of pain from subacromial or acromioclavicular injections even when there were advanced radiologic changes in the glenohumeral joint.

2028;16215231;Extended upstream A-T sequence increases T7 promoter strength.;Bacteriophage T7 promoters contain a consensus sequence from -17 to +6 relative to the transcription start site, +1. In addition, the strong class III promoters are characterized by an extended AT-rich region upstream of -17, which is often interrupted by one or more GC base pairs in the weaker class II promoters. Herein we studied the role of the AT-rich region upstream of -17 in transcription regulation of T7 RNA polymerase. Equilibrium DNA binding studies with promoter fragments of consensus sequence truncated at various positions between -17 and -27 showed that the polymerase-promoter complex is significantly stabilized as the upstream AT-rich sequence is extended to and beyond -22. Similarly, promoters in which the AT-rich region from -17 to -22 is interrupted by several GC base pairs showed weak binding. Kinetic studies indicated that the presence of extended AT-rich sequence slows the dissociation rate constant of the polymerase-promoter complex and slightly stimulates the association rate constant, thereby increasing the stability of the complex. Measurement of the transcription activity revealed that the extended AT-rich region does not affect the kinetics of abortive synthesis up to the formation of 8-nucleotide RNA but causes accumulation of longer abortive products between 9 and 13 nucleotides. The observed effects of the upstream DNA region were AT sequence-specific, and the results suggested a larger role for the extended AT-rich sequence that has been unappreciated previously. We propose that the AT-rich DNA sequence upstream of -17 plays a role in modulating the efficiency of transcription initiation by affecting both the affinity of T7 RNA polymerase for the promoter and the efficiency of promoter clearance. ;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

The promoter region contains a TATA box, a GC-rich region, and putative transcription factor binding elements such as cAMP response element binding protein/activating transcription factor (CREB/ATF) and ets. Adenovirus-mediated transient expression of the flt-1 promoter/luciferase fusion gene in endothelial cells and other cell types demonstrated that a 1-kilobase fragment of the 5'-flanking region of flt-1 is involved in the endothelial-specific expression. A CREB/ATF element was found to be essential for basal transcription of the flt-1 expression. In addition, we also showed that the first intron negatively regulates flt-1 promoter activity. The flt-1 promoter will be useful in functional studies on the regulation of endothelial-specific gene expression and also as a tool in targeting the expression of exogenously introduced genes to the endothelium.;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
2033;8482355;Identification of DNA-binding proteins in the parasitic protozoan Crithidia fasciculata and evidence for their association with the mitochondrial genome.;The single mitochondrion of trypanosomatid protozoans such as Crithidia fasciculata has a large and complex network of AT-rich DNA called kDNA. Little is known about proteins involved in the packaging and morphogenesis of this network. I report the purification of a protein fraction from this parasite which preferentially retained kDNA in the gel slot during electrophoresis. The proteins had approximate molecular weights of 22, 21, 17.5, 16.5, 15, and 13 kDa. They copurified with mitochondrial DNA, parts of which they protected from nuclease attack. The proteins resembled histones but they also differed from histones in significant ways. Immunological evidence showed that the proteins were enriched in a mitochondrial fraction, implying their association with kDNA in vivo. ;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

2040;6683760;Structure of the actin molecule determined from electron micrographs of crystalline actin sheets with a tentative alignment of the molecule in the actin filament.;Electron microscopy and image processing of negatively stained crystalline sheets induced from Acanthamoeba actin have been used to yield a three-dimensional reconstruction of the actin molecule, including data to a maximum resolution of 15 A. This model shows actin to be an asymmetric, wedge-shaped molecule. A three-dimensional reconstruction of an averaged, polar actin filament from negatively stained polylysine-induced actin filament paracrystals has also been computed. We show two possible ways in which the wedge-shaped actin molecule from the sheets can be placed into such a filament reconstruction. In both, the major intermolecular contacts are formed on complementary surfaces of the actin subunit and follow the left-handed genetic helix of the filament, a feature also found in the filament reconstruction. ;polylysine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
2043;9370845;Intubating conditions using cisatracurium after induction of anaesthesia with thiopentone.;"We studied tracheal intubation conditions produced by the muscle relaxant, cisatracurium, following induction of anaesthesia with fentanyl (2 micrograms.kg-1) and thiopentone (6 mg.kg-1). Sixty patients were randomly assigned to receive cisatracurium in a single bolus dose of either 0.15 or 0.20 mg.kg-1. Tracheal intubation was commenced 120 s after injection of the relaxant. The mean (SD) time taken to achieve intubation was significantly shorter in the 0.20 mg.kg-1 group (137 (16) s) than the 0.15 mg.kg-1 group (149 (12) s; p < 0.05). The intubating conditions were better after the larger dose. Our results suggest that when anaesthesia is induced using thiopentone, a dose of 0.20 mg.kg-1 of cisatracurium is recommended to ensure satisfactory intubating conditions.";-;-;-;hard_0
2044;8100768;Xenopus Distal-less related homeobox genes are expressed in the developing forebrain and are induced by planar signals.;The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to isolated five Xenopus homeobox clones (X-dll1 to 5) that are related to the Drosophila Distal-less (Dll) gene and we propose a subdivision of the vertebrate distal-less gene family according to sequence similarities. cDNA clones were isolated for X-dll2, 3 and 4, and their expression was studied by RNase protection and in situ hybridization. X-dll2, which belongs to a separate subfamily than X-dll3 and 4, is not expressed in the neural ectoderm. X-dll3 and X-dll4, which belong to the same subfamily, have a similar but not identical pattern of expression that is restricted to anterior ectodermal derivatives, namely the ventral forebrain, the cranial neural crest and the cement gland. X-dll3 is also expressed in the olfactory and otic placodes while X-dll4 is expressed in the developing eye. X-dll3 differs from the other Xenopus genes and the previously isolated Dll-related mouse genes, in that localized expression can be detected by in situ hybridization very early in development, in the anterior-transverse ridge of the open neural plate. Based on that early expression pattern, we suggest that X-dll3 marks the rostral-most part of the neural plate, which gives rise to the ventral forebrain. Finally, we have used these Xenopus distal-less genes to show that the anterior neural plate can be induced by signals that spread within the plane of neural ectoderm, indicating that at least the initial steps of forebrain development do not require signals from underlying mesoderm.;-;-;-;hard_0
2045;21462314;Temporal and spatial SOX9 expression patterns in the course of gonad development of the caudate amphibian Pleurodeles waltl.;The SOX family of transcription factors is thought to regulate gene expression in a wide variety of developmental processes. Namely, SOX9 expression is conserved in vertebrate sex determination or differentiation. Nevertheless, information about caudate amphibians is lacking. In this study, we provide data on Pleurodeles waltl, a species that displays a ZZ/ZW genetic mode of sex determination and a temperature-dependent mechanism of female-to-male sex reversal. Phylogenetic analysis of SOX9 P. waltl ortholog reveals that the deduced protein segregates from the group of anuran and could be more closely related to amniote than to anamniote. However, SOX9 lacks the PQA-rich domain present in amniotes. In larvae, SOX9 is expressed in both sexes in gonad-mesonephros complexes as soon as stage 42, before gonad differentiation. At stage 54(60d) at which testis differentiation is already in progress, analyses of isolated gonads reveal a male-enriched expression of SOX9, which was quantified by real-time PCR. At the end of metamorphosis (stage 56), SOX9 shows a nuclear localization only in the testis. In adults, SOX9 is still expressed in testes and ovaries. In the ovary, SOX9 is found in oocytes from stage I to stage VI but it is never detected in the nucleus. Our results suggest that in P. waltl, like in non mammalian vertebrates, SOX9 could play a role during the late phase of gonad differentiation rather than in sex determination. Its role in germ cells of the adult ovary has still to be elucidated. ;polyalanine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
2062;15710891;Immune evasion by hepatitis C virus NS3/4A protease-mediated cleavage of the Toll-like receptor 3 adaptor protein TRIF.;Toll-like receptors (TLRs) bind pathogen-specific ligands early in infection, initiating signaling pathways that lead to expression of multiple protective cellular genes. Many viruses have evolved strategies that block the effector mechanisms induced through these signaling pathways, but viral interference with critical proximal receptor interactions has not been described. We show here that the NS3/4A serine protease of hepatitis C virus (HCV), a virus notorious for its ability to establish persistent intrahepatic infection, causes specific proteolysis of Toll-IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-beta (TRIF or TICAM-1), an adaptor protein linking TLR3 to kinases responsible for activating IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) and NF-kappaB, transcription factors controlling a multiplicity of antiviral defenses. NS3/4A-mediated cleavage of TRIF reduces its abundance and inhibits polyI:C-activated signaling through the TLR3 pathway before its bifurcation to IRF-3 and NF-kappaB. This uniquely broad mechanism of immune evasion potentially limits expression of multiple host defense genes, thereby promoting persistent infections with this medically important virus. ;polyisoleucine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
2064;8019196;Present principles of workers' health care organization in Poland and directions of future changes.;The present-day legal regulations on workers' health care are far from satisfactory. The work on the modification of the occupational health service has been carried out for the last two years although the preparatory activities started much earlier. In May 1991, under the initiative of the Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine in Lodz, the bill on the Labor Code has been amended so that it would regulate the employer's responsibilities with respect to providing health care for workers and to participating in respective costs. These activities have overrun the more general ones pertaining to the reform of the national health service in Poland. Under conditions of the growing free market economy the previously operated organizational system of health care for workers has become out-of-date and needs immediate modification to adjust it to the new economic situation. Evidently, the trends and rate of the policy in this respect have been considerably influenced by the more general activities to make Poland associated with the European Community and hence to develop an occupational health care system which would take into consideration the principles of the Charter of Social Rights of the EEC as well as of the ILO Conventions.;-;-;-;hard_0
2065;24233006;The zygote cell wall of Chlamydomonas reinhardii: a structural, chemical and immunological approach.;The zygote cell wall of Chlamydomonas reinhardii has been studied using structural, chemical and immunological methods. Monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antisera that were originally raised to the major hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins of the vegetative cell wall were used to probe the zygote wall for common antigenic components. These antibodies cross-reacted strongly and specifically with components of the zygote cell wall, and were used to show the origin, route of transport, and the location of these antigens within the zygote cell wall. The zygote cell wall contained about 10% protein, with hydroxyproline accounting for 22.5 mol % of the total amino acids present. Glucose was the most abundant sugar residue, and accounted for 56% of the total sugar present. Gas liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry showed the presence of a (1-3)β-D-glucan as the major structural polysaccharide within the zygote cell wall. The (1-3)β-D-glucan was detected and localised within the zygote cell wall by immunogold labelling of thin sections. Using an antiserum directed against (1-3)β-D-linked glucose units, this polysaccharide was found to be consistently present within the non-staining layer of both young and mature zygote cell walls. (1-3)β-D-Glucan was also detected in other wall layer using higher concentrations of antiserum. No intracellular labelling was found, indicating that the plasmamembrane is the site for the synthesis of this polysaccharide within the Chlamydomonas zygote.  ;polyproline;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
2067;2100196;Domain deletion in the extracellular portion of the EGF-receptor reduces ligand binding and impairs cell surface expression.;Cultured NIH-3T3 cells were transfected with cDNA constructs encoding human epidermal growth factor-receptor (EGF-R)* and two deletion mutants in the extracellular portion of the receptor molecule. One mutant is devoid of 124 amino-terminal amino acids, and the other lacks 76 residues. Mutant receptors were not delivered to the cell surface unless the transfected cells contained also endogenous EGF-Rs, suggesting that receptor interaction complements the mutation and allows surface display of mutant receptors. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed an association between mutant and endogenous EGF-Rs when both proteins were expressed in the same cell. Hence, receptor-oligomers may exist in the plane of the membrane even in the absence of ligand binding, and oligomerization may play a role in normal trafficking of EGF-Rs to the cell surface. Mutant receptors retained partial ligand binding activity as 125I-labeled EGF was covalently cross-linked to both mutant receptors, and EGF stimulated, albeit weakly, their protein tyrosine kinase activity. Both mutant EGF-Rs bind EGF with a 10-fold lower affinity than that of the solubilized wild type EGF-R. These results provide further evidence that the region flanked by the two cysteine-rich domains plays a crucial role in defining ligand-binding specificity of EGF-R. ;polycysteine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
2069;9143302;Antigenically distinct G glycoproteins of BRSV strains share a high degree of genetic homogeneity.;Bovine respiratory syncytial (BRS) virus can be divided into antigenic subgroups based on the reactivity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the attachment glycoprotein, G. Further, the polyclonal antibody response of calves vaccinated with recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing the G protein of a particular subgroup is also subgroup-specific. To investigate the genetic basis for the antigenic heterogeneity of the BRS virus G protein, the genes for the G protein from 6 BRS virus strains representative of the antigenic subgroups were cloned, sequenced, and compared with the prototype subgroup A strain, 391-2. There was only 10% nucleic acid difference and 15% amino acid difference between strains from different subgroups. These findings are in sharp contrast to the situation with human RS virus, where there is a 45% difference in amino acid identity between subgroups. In fact, the extent of amino acid difference between BRS virus subgroups is similar to the level of heterogeneity observed within human subgroups. Analysis of the reactivity of mAbs with peptides from the cysteine-rich region (174-188) of the G protein representing each antigenic subgroup indicated that amino acids at positions 180, 183, and possibly 184 are important in subgroup distinction. Taken together, these data suggest that although the genetic variation responsible for the antigenic differences determining subgroups among BRS viruses is more limited than that observed among human RS virus subgroups, the amino acid differences that exist have a profound effect upon antibody recognition. ;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

2071;1849459;The trk proto-oncogene encodes a receptor for nerve growth factor.;Two classes of receptors with distinct affinities for nerve growth factor (NGF) have been identified. The low affinity receptor (Kd approximately 10(-9) to 10(-8) M) is a cysteine-rich glycoprotein encoded by the previously characterized LNGFR gene. The structural nature of the high affinity receptor (Kd approximately 10(-11) to 10(-10) M) has yet to be established. In this study we show that the product of the human trk proto-oncogene (gp140trk) binds NGF with high affinity. Moreover, NGF could be chemically cross-linked to the endogenous gp140trk present in rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cells as well as to gp140trk ectopically expressed in mouse fibroblasts and in insect Sf9 cells. High affinity binding of NGF to gp140trk can occur in the absence of low affinity LNGFR receptors, at least in nonneural cells. Addition of NGF to PC12 cells elicits rapid phosphorylation of gp140trk on tyrosine residues and stimulates its tyrosine kinase activity. These results indicate that gp140trk is a functional NGF receptor that mediates at least some of the signal transduction processes initiated by this neurotrophic factor.;polycysteine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
2075;27622275;The Arginine/Lysine-Rich Element within the DNA-Binding Domain Is Essential for Nuclear Localization and Function of the Intracellular Pathogen Resistance 1.;The mouse intracellular pathogen resistance 1 (Ipr1) gene plays important roles in mediating host immunity and previous work showed that it enhances macrophage apoptosis upon mycobacterium infection. However, to date, little is known about the regulation pattern of Ipr1 action. Recent studies have investigated the protein-coding genes and microRNAs regulated by Ipr1 in mouse macrophages, but the structure and the functional motif of the Ipr1 protein have yet to be explored. In this study, we analyzed the domains and functional motif of the Ipr1 protein. The resulting data reveal that Ipr1 protein forms a homodimer and that the Sp100-like domain mediates the targeting of Ipr1 protein to nuclear dots (NDs). Moreover, we found that an Ipr1 mutant lacking the classic nuclear localization signal (cNLS) also translocated into the nuclei, suggesting that the cNLS is not the only factor that directs Ipr1 nuclear localization. Additionally, mechanistic studies revealed that an arginine/lysine-rich element within the DNA-binding domain (SAND domain) is critical for Ipr1 binding to the importin protein receptor NPI-1, demonstrating that this element plays an essential role in mediating the nuclear localization of Ipr1 protein. Furthermore, our results show that this arginine/lysine-rich element contributes to the transcriptional regulation and apoptotic activity of Ipr1. These findings highlight the structural foundations of Ipr1 action and provide new insights into the mechanism of Ipr1-mediated resistance to mycobacterium.  ;polylysine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
2076;1551877;Recombinant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 nucleocapsid (NCp7) protein unwinds tRNA.;"The nucleocapsid protein (NC) of all animal retroviruses, encoded by the gag gene, is the major structural protein of the core ribonucleoprotein complex, bound to genomic RNA in mature virions. NC is also thought to play one or more accessory roles in reverse transcription. Mature NC (p7NC) from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a 71-amino acid, basic protein which contains two Cys3His Zn(II) retroviral-type zinc finger domains. Herein, we describe the subcloning and expression of HIV-1 NC, denoted NC71, from an inducible phage T7 RNA polymerase promoter in Escherichia coli. Purified NC71 can be reversibly reconstituted with 2 g.at Zn(II) determined by atomic absorption. Ultraviolet circulation dichroism spectroscopy has been used to characterize the complexes between highly purified NC71 and the RNA homopolynucleotide poly(A) and E. coli tRNA(mixed). On poly(A), Zn2 NC71 is characterized by an apparent site size n = 15 +/- 3 nucleotides and high affinity (Kapp = 3 x 10(7) M-1) and moderately cooperative (omega approximately 170 +/- 25) binding. A mixture of E. coli tRNA species (tRNA(mixed) was used to probe the conformational changes induced in tRNA upon binding of HIV-1 NC71. Two structural forms of tRNA(mixed), which differ in their degree of tertiary structure, were assayed for their susceptibility to denaturation by NC71. Five molar monomer equivalents of NC71 are required to denature the ""inactive"" tRNA in the absence of Mg2+. A Zn(II)-free, oxidized form of NC71 was also shown to unwind inactive tRNA with the same efficiency and stoichiometry. The detailed spectral changes which occur on NC-induced denaturation closely mimic temperature-induced denaturation of inactive tRNA(mixed). The prototype helix-destabilizing protein, T4 gene 32 protein, is unable to unwind this form of tRNA under the same conditions. The stoichiometry of unwinding of inactive tRNA by NC71 is consistent with the site size determined with poly(A). An ""active"" form of tRNA(mixed), prepared by thermal denaturation and refolding of the inactive form with Mg2+, proved less susceptible to both temperature and NC71-induced unwinding. The mechanistic implications of these findings on the reported biochemical activities of RNA:RNA annealing and replication primer tRNA positioning by NC are discussed.

2078;16054707;Mapping of functional regions conferring nuclear localization and RNA-binding activity of pseudorabies virus early protein UL54.;Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is an alphaherpesvirus, and its gene organization and regulation are similar to the well-characterized human herpes simplex virus (HSV). The PRV early protein UL54 consists of 363 amino acids with homology to the HSV ICP27 immediate-early protein. Previously, we have demonstrated the nuclear accumulation and poly(G) RNA-binding activity of UL54 protein. In the present study, we have identified further the functional regions within UL54 conferring for nuclear localization and RNA-binding activity. Several recombinant expression plasmids containing various coding regions of UL54 gene were constructed for producing a series of C-terminally truncated or internally deleted forms of UL54 mutants in Escherichia coli or porcine kidney (PK-15) cells. RNA-binding activity of E. coli-expressed UL54 mutants was characterized by the binding ability to poly(G) RNA homopolymer in dot blot hybridization assay and the results have shown that the N-terminal 83 residues were responsible for RNA-binding, and the region of residues 35-82 containing an RGG box was necessary for its function. Furthermore, the region responsible for nuclear localization was investigated by transient expression of various deletion mutants in PK-15 cells followed by detection of their subcellular distribution. The results showed that C-terminal deletion beyond the amino acid residue 83 or internal deletion containing the RGG box sequence could restrict UL54 mutants in the cytoplasm. The ability of the N-terminal 83 residues to target the green fluorescence protein to the nucleus confirmed further its role as a functional nuclear localization signal (NLS). The utmost N-terminal 83 residues portion of UL54 contains two important functional domains, NLS and RNA-binding, and thus it would play an indispensable role in UL54 regulatory function. ;polyglycine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

2081;8127007;Angiotensin II stimulates human fetal mesangial cell proliferation and fibronectin biosynthesis by binding to AT1 receptors.;The renin-angiotensin system is activated during vascular development and injury. Furthermore, angiotensin II (Ang II) is a comitogen for fetal mesangial cells in vitro and it may be important in vascular smooth cell growth in disease states. Since fibronectin is an important extracellular matrix protein for vascular development and it too is overexpressed in the mesangium of diseased glomeruli, we explored the interrelationship of fibronectin and Ang II in fetal mesangial cell growth. In human fetal kidney, Ang II type 2 receptors (AT2) were detected in abundance by ex vivo autoradiography. When mesangial cells were isolated from fetal kidney and grown in culture, Ang II type 1 receptors (AT1) were also detected. To explore the mitogenic properties Ang II and fibronectin as well as the effects of Ang II on fibronectin metabolism, studies were performed in vitro, isolated from the potentially confounding variables of hemodynamic influence and circulating growth factors and cytokines. In vitro, mesangial cells expressed a single class of AT1 receptors that were not altered by growth on various substrates. Ang II (10(-7) M) significantly increased thymidine incorporation by confluent human fetal mesangial cells (twofold). When subconfluent, Ang II-stimulated proliferation was greater (fourfold). Ang II significantly increased cell-associated and secreted fibronectin as determined by immunoprecipitation at concentrations that also stimulate mitogenesis. Both of these Ang II-mediated responses were inhibited by the AT1 receptor antagonist DuP-753 (10(-5) M) but not by AT2 receptor antagonist.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS);-;-;-;hard_0
2082;6666405;[Significance of chronic ischemic heart disease and its various forms for sudden death].;Our results confirm that chronic-ischemic heart disease is the most important cause of different forms of acute death. This is observed more often in men than in women. The average age of the deceased is especially low in cases of instantaneous death. The instantaneous death concerns males twice as often as females. In all age groups until the 8th decade, all kinds of acute death predominate in men. Acute myocardial infarction in cases of acute death is more frequent in women than in men. In nearly 4/5 of all cases we found a stenosing atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries whose rate is somewhat higher in males than in females. The greater part of all cases with acute death is characterized by signs of fresh or old disturbances of the coronary circulation. Only in 15% of all cases, we found no morphologic changes in the myocardium. This finding was especially often observed in cases of sudden death. To our opinion, in many cases the morphologic findings are not sufficient to explain the cause of acute death. Additional factors must also be taken into consideration.;-;-;-;hard_0
2083;8538623;Protein kinase D (PKD): a novel target for diacylglycerol and phorbol esters.;A novel serine/threonine protein kinase regulated by phorbol esters and diacylglycerol (named PKD) has been identified. PKD contains a cysteine-rich repeat sequence homologous to that seen in the regulatory domain of protein kinase C (PKC). A bacterially expressed NH2-terminal domain of PKD exhibited high affinity phorbol ester binding activity (Kd = 35 nM). Expression of PKD cDNA in COS cells conferred increased phorbol ester binding to intact cells. The catalytic domain of PKD contains all characteristic sequence motifs of serine protein kinases but shows only a low degree of sequence similarity to PKCs. The bacterially expressed catalytic domain of PKD efficiently phosphorylated the exogenous peptide substrate syntide-2 in serine but did not catalyse significant phosphorylation of a variety of other substrates utilised by PKCs and other major second messenger regulated kinases. PKD expressed in COS cells showed syntide-2 kinase activity that was stimulated by phorbol esters in the presence of phospholipids. We propose that PKD may be a novel component in the transduction of diacylglycerol and phorbol ester signals.;polycysteine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
2086;8940392;The cytosolic 47-kilodalton protein that binds to the 3' untranslated region of epidermal growth factor transcripts responds to orchiectomy in a tissue-specific fashion.;The submaxillary gland (SMG) of the male mouse is known to contain more epidermal growth factor (EGF) messenger RNA (mRNA) than that of the female. In contrast, the SMG of female mice contains more of a cytosolic 47-kDa RNA binding protein that binds to a unique 23-b sequence at the end of the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of EGF, which includes the canonical polyadenylation signal in an AU-rich region containing a potential mRNA destabilizing sequence. Testosterone treatment can change the activity of this 47-kDa protein within 1 day, which precedes the change produced in the level and in the polyadenylation of EGF mRNA in female mice. In the kidney, however, neither the 47-kDa protein nor the polyadenylation pattern changed after testosterone. We now report that 2 weeks following orchiectomy of Balb/c mice, mature EGF peptide immunoreactivity levels fall by 96% (P < 0.0002), and mRNA levels fall by 76% (P < 0.0001). Orchiectomy also enhances the RNA binding activities of the 47-kDa protein in SMG cytosol but not in the kidney: UV cross-linking to 3' UTR RNA is increased by 67% (P < 0.01) and shifting of the gel mobility of the RNA is increased by 47% (P < 0.05). The polyadenylation pattern of EGF transcripts also changes in SMG but not in kidney cytosol. After orchiectomy, the population of EGF transcripts in the SMG with short, heterogenous poly-A tails (<50 A's) decreases by 31% (P < 0.03), whereas transcripts with long poly-A tails of approximately 50, 70, 100, and 200 A's all increase and become more distinct, resembling the pattern found in the normal female. Thus, 2 weeks after orchiectomy, the responses in EGF expression, EGF mRNA polyadenylation, and the activities of the 47-kDa 3' UTR binding protein are the reciprocal of the responses produced by injecting female mice with testosterone for 5 days, providing further evidence that circulating androgens regulate EGF expression posttranscriptionally in a sexually dimorphic, tissue-specific fashion.; polyalanine ;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Sequence comparison showed 34.5% identity to E. coli Par10 and 34% identity to human Pin1 (hPar18) within a C-terminal region of 87 or 120 amino acid residues, respectively. In comparison to the E. coli Par10, hPar14 possesses a N-terminal extension of 41 amino acid residues. This extension does not contain a polyproline II helix-binding motif typical of the known eukaryotic parvulins. The hPar14 does not accelerate the cis to trans interconversion of oligopeptides with side chain-phosphorylated Ser(Thr)-Pro moieties as hPin1 did. In contrast, it showed preference of an arginine residue adjacent N-terminal to proline.

2090;22817732;Human papillomavirus gene expression is controlled by host cell splicing factors.;HPVs (human papillomaviruses) infect stratified epithelia and cause a variety of lesions ranging from benign warts to invasive tumours. The virus life cycle is tightly linked to differentiation of the keratinocyte it infects: papillomaviruses modulate host gene expression to ensure efficient virus replication. For example, the viral transcription factor E2 can directly up-regulate, in an epithelial differentiation-dependent manner, cellular SRSFs [SR (serine/arginine-rich) splicing factors] that control constitutive and alternative splicing. Changes in alternative splicing and the mechanisms controlling this for viral mRNAs have been the subject of intense exploration. However, to date experiments have only been carried out in model systems because the genetic systems suitable for studying alternative splicing of viral RNAs in the context of the virus life cycle are relatively recent and technically challenging. Now using these life cycle-supporting systems, our laboratory has identified SR proteins as important players in differentiation-dependent regulation of HPV gene expression. Better understanding of the role of cellular factors in regulating the virus life cycle is needed as it may help development of novel diagnostic approaches and antiviral therapies in the future. ;polyarginine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
2091;10207045;Dual specificity protein kinase activity of testis-specific protein kinase 1 and its regulation by autophosphorylation of serine-215 within the activation loop.;"TESK1 (testis-specific protein kinase 1) is a protein kinase with a structure composed of an N-terminal protein kinase domain and a C-terminal proline-rich domain. Whereas the 3.6-kilobase TESK1 mRNA is expressed predominantly in the testis, a faint 2.5-kilobase TESK1 mRNA is expressed ubiquitously. The kinase domain of TESK1 contains in the catalytic loop in subdomain VIB an unusual DLTSKN sequence, which is not related to the consensus sequence of either serine/threonine kinases or tyrosine kinases. In this study, we show that TESK1 has kinase activity with dual specificity on both serine/threonine and tyrosine residues. In an in vitro kinase reaction, the kinase domain of TESK1 underwent autophosphorylation on serine and tyrosine residues and catalyzed phosphorylation of histone H3 and myelin basic protein on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues. Site-directed mutagenesis analyses revealed that Ser-215 within the ""activation loop"" of the kinase domain is the site of serine autophosphorylation of TESK1. Replacement of Ser-215 by alanine almost completely abolished serine autophosphorylation and histone H3 kinase activities. In contrast, replacement of Ser-215 by glutamic acid abolished serine autophosphorylation activity but retained histone H3 kinase activity. These results suggest that autophosphorylation of Ser-215 is an important step to positively regulate the kinase activity of TESK1. ";polyproline;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function

Herein we report the case of a variant of Claude's syndrome, which shows pupil-sparing oculomotor nerve palsy without the accompanying neurological deficits other than subtle truncal ataxia. MRI and Diffusion Tensor Imaging revealed that midbrain infarction was located rostrally above the decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP) and might have partially destructed the tectospinal tract, which resulted in the absence of limb ataxia and presence of subtle truncal ataxia. In this variant of Claude's syndrome, we should carefully assess truncal ataxia to avoid misdiagnosing it as isolated pupil-sparing oculomotor nerve palsy because the patient showed apparently normal gait and truncal ataxia was only revealed by unstable tandem gait.;-;-;-;hard_0

2103;9080219;Nuclear and cytoplasmic dynamics of sperm penetration, pronuclear formation and microtubule organization during fertilization and early preimplantation development in the human.;This report describes spatial and temporal aspects of sperm penetration and intracytoplasmic migration, pronuclear evolution and the specificity of presyngamic opposition, stage-specific changes in cytoskeletal organization and the relative contribution of maternal and paternal components to mitotic spindle formation. These studies involved observations of living human oocytes during conventional insemination in vitro and after intracytoplasmic deposition of spermatozoa, analysis of chromatin organization and distribution during pronuclear evolution, and detection of actin and alpha-, beta- and gamma-tubulin by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Immature and mature oocytes, penetrated but unfertilized oocytes, fertilized but arrested eggs, and cleavage-stage embryos from normal and dispermic fertilizations were examined. The results demonstrate that sperm nuclear migration to the maternal perinuclear region is rapid and linear, occurs in the absence of a detectable cytoskeletal system and appears to be assisted by an unusual configuration of the sperm tail principal piece which results from either retained intracytoplasmic motility or the process by which the sperm tail is progressively incorporated into the oocyte. Our findings also show a specificity of pronuclear alignment that is associated with a polarized distribution of both maternal and paternal chromatin, and with the position of the sperm centrosome and the presence of microtubules nucleated from this structure. The results also indicate that a maternal microtubule nucleating capacity is present in the immature oocyte but is apparently inactive until spindle formation. The poles of the first mitotic spindle appear to be derived from the sperm centrosome, although some maternal contribution cannot be excluded. The sperm tail and centrosome persist in a single cell through the cleavage stages, and the latter serves as a prominent site of cytoplasmic microtubule nucleation. The results provide a detailed understanding of the cellular and nuclear morphodynamics of the human fertilization process and indicate subtle defects that may be responsible for early developmental failure.;-;-;-;hard_0

According to this analysis, vulnerability to anxiety stems mainly from a lower threshold for appraising threat, rather than a bias in the direction of attention deployment. Thus, relatively innocuous stimuli are evaluated as having higher subjective threat value by high than low trait anxious individuals, and it is further assumed that everyone orients to stimuli that are judged to be significantly threatening. This account is contrasted with other recent cognitive models of anxiety, and implications for the etiology, maintenance and treatment of anxiety disorders are discussed.;-;-;-;hard_0

Therefore, in the present study we performed whole-exome sequencing on three cases of LEGH collected by laser-microdissection from the frozen tissue sections of surgically removed uteri. Analysis of the results identified 50 somatic variants. After several filtering processes, we identified 13 functional variants, including 12 missense and one insertion-deletion variants. Of these mutations, keratinocyte proline-rich protein, olfactory receptor M4 and zinc finger protein 645 mutations were found in the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer but were not related to carcinogenic diseases. We did not detect any significant copy number alterations or signatures.

2116;23832975;ESR dosimetry of fossil enamel: some comments about measurement precision, long-term signal fading and dose-response curve fitting.;This work deals with the specific studies of three main sources of uncertainty in electron spin resonance (ESR) dosimetry/dating of fossil tooth enamel: (1) the precision of the ESR measurements, (2) the long-term signal fading the selection of the fitting function. They show a different influence on the equivalent dose (D(E)) estimates. Repeated ESR measurements were performed on 17 different samples: results show a mean coefficient of variation of the ESR intensities of 1.20 ± 0.23 %, inducing a mean relative variability of 3.05 ± 2.29 % in the D(E) values. ESR signal fading over 5 y was also observed: its magnitude seems to be quite sample dependant but is nevertheless especially important for the most irradiated aliquots. This fading has an apparent random effect on the D(E) estimates. Finally, the authors provide new insights and recommendations about the fitting of ESR dose-response curves of fossil enamel with a double saturating exponential (DSE) function. The potential of a new variation of the DSE was also explored. Results of this study also show that the choice of the fitting function is of major importance, maybe more than the other sources previously mentioned, in order to get accurate final D(E) values.;-;-;-;hard_0
2118;25963153;Functional Neuroimaging: Fundamental Principles and Clinical Applications.;Functional imaging modalities, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), are rapidly changing the scope and practice of neuroradiology. While these modalities have long been used in research, they are increasingly being used in clinical practice to enable reliable identification of eloquent cortex and white matter tracts in order to guide treatment planning and to serve as a diagnostic supplement when traditional imaging fails. An understanding of the scientific principles underlying fMRI and DTI is necessary in current radiological practice. fMRI relies on a compensatory hemodynamic response seen in cortical activation and the intrinsic discrepant magnetic properties of deoxy- and oxyhemoglobin. Neuronal activity can be indirectly visualized based on a hemodynamic response, termed neurovascular coupling. fMRI demonstrates utility in identifying areas of cortical activation (i.e., task-based activation) and in discerning areas of neuronal connectivity when used during the resting state, termed resting state fMRI. While fMRI is limited to visualization of gray matter, DTI permits visualization of white matter tracts through diffusion restriction along different axes. We will discuss the physical, statistical and physiological principles underlying these functional imaging modalities and explore new promising clinical applications.;-;-;-;hard_0

Plaque formation was not caused by release of passively adsorbed immunoglobulin but depended on active immunoglobulin secretion. We have investigated optimal conditions for plaque formation in this test system. Good reproducibility is obtained only if cells to be tested are kept in the cold before assay, since the antibody-forming capacity of these cells is rapidly exhausted at temperatures above 2 degrees C.

2124;22906355;The arginine-rich N-terminal domain of ROP18 is necessary for vacuole targeting and virulence of Toxoplasma gondii.;Toxoplasma gondii uses specialized secretory organelles called rhoptries to deliver virulence determinants into the host cell during parasite invasion. One such determinant called rhoptry protein 18 (ROP18) is a polymorphic serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates host targets to modulate acute virulence. Following secretion into the host cell, ROP18 traffics to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) where it is tethered to the cytosolic face of this host-pathogen interface. However, the functional consequences of PVM association are not known. In this report, we show that ROP18 mutants altered in an arginine-rich domain upstream of the kinase domain fail to associate to the PVM following secretion from rhoptries. During infection, host cells upregulate immunity-related GTPases that localize to and destroy the PVM surrounding the parasites. ROP18 disarms this host innate immune pathway by phosphorylating IRGs in a critical GTPase domain and preventing loading on the PVM. Vacuole-targeting mutants of ROP18 failed to phosphorylate Irga6 and were unable to divert IRGs from the PVM, despite retaining intrinsic kinase activity. As a consequence, these mutants were avirulent in a mouse model of acute toxoplasmosis. Thus, the association of ROP18 with the PVM, mediated by its N-terminal arginine-rich domain, is critical to its function as a virulence determinant. ;polyarginine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
2125;345009;Immune reactivity during aging. I. T-helper dependent and independent antibody responses to different antigens, in vivo and in vitro.;The immunological status during aging was assessed by measuring the antibody response of the long-lived (C3H/eb X C57Bl/6J)F1 mice to various antigens in vivo and in vitro. In vivo, a decrease in antibody production to DNP and NIP haptenic determinants coupled on to BGG, as well as the response to SRBC, was observed. The decline was more pronounced in the IgG as compared to IgM antibodies. The results were recorded when various parameters such as antigen dose and kinetics of the response, were considered. Reduction of the antibody response was also noted when PVP was employed as immunogen. Similar results were noted when the responses to SRBC and DNP--polylysine were induced and followed in spleen organ cultures. In all of these experimental systems, the peak response was observed in mice 6--12 months old. From then on a gradual decrease was manifested, mice 30--36 months old producing significantly low responses. The results demonstrate that decrease in antibody production is expressed in the isolated spleen tissue in the same manner as in the intact animal. Furthermore, they were interpreted as indicating that the lesion may be at the T helper and the B cell compartments.;polylysine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

Monoclonal antibody 12H raised against 5E5cDNA fusion protein recognized an intranuclear substance in rat brain sections and a single protein band of about 98 kDa in the brain nuclear extract fraction on immunoblotting. DNA-cellulose column chromatography indicated that 5E5 protein might have DNA-binding ability. Transfection studies indicated that 5E5 protein expressed in COS-1 is localized in cell nuclei.

They guide folding, site-specific nucleotide modifications and participate in cleavage of precursor ribosomal RNAs. To better understand how the biogenesis of the box C/D small nucleolar RNPs (snoRNPs) occur in a cellular context, we used a new approach based on the possibility of relocalizing a given nuclear complex by adding an affinity tag for B23 to one component of this complex. We selectively delocalized each core box C/D protein, namely 15.5kD, Nop56, Nop58 and fibrillarin, and analyzed the effect of such changes on other components of the box C/D snoRNPs. We show that modifying the localization and the mobility of core box C/D proteins impairs their association with box C/D snoRNPs. In addition, we demonstrate that fibrillarin and Nop56 directly interact in vivo. This interaction, indispensable for the association of both proteins with the box C/D snoRNPs, does not involve the glycine- and arginine-rich domain or the RNA-binding domain but the alpha-helix domain of fibrillarin. In addition, no RNA seems required to maintain fibrillarin-Nop56 interaction. ;polyarginine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
2133;8203437;Perinatal morbidity associated with violence experienced by pregnant women.;"OBJECTIVE
We investigated whether physical assault is independently associated with an adverse obstetric outcome.


STUDY DESIGN
We compared the perinatal outcomes of 32 indigent women who reported being physically abused during pregnancy with those of 352 control subjects who denied ever being assaulted. Patients were classified into the appropriate category on the basis of a structured interview. Logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate the relative risk of adverse outcome while adjusting for confounders.


RESULTS
Women assaulted in the current pregnancy were twice as likely to have preterm labor as compared with those who denied assault. In addition, crude odds ratios showed a twofold increased risk of chorioamnionitis in assault victims. No difference between abused and nonabused women was noted in the prevalence of preterm delivery, pregnancy-induced hypertension, cesarean section, meconium staining, infant birth weight, Apgar scores, intrauterine growth retardation, fetal distress, fetal death, neonatal seizures, sepsis, or admission to the intensive care unit.


CONCLUSIONS
This study demonstrates that physical assault during pregnancy is associated with preterm labor and chorioamnionitis. Screening for ongoing assault should be incorporated into routine prenatal care to identify women at risk of complications.";-;-;-;hard_0
2134;6411383;Influence of solutes in plasma on the total CO2 content determination: implications for clinical disorders.;"The purpose of these experiments was to determine the effect of non-aqueous solids on the total CO2 content of plasma. Two major groups of compounds were explored; those which reduced the total CO2 content, such as saline, and those which did not, such as albumin. To assess the former, sufficient sodium chloride was added to a bicarbonate solution gassed with 5% CO2 to increase the total volume by 10%. The total CO2 content fell the predicted 10% from 27.2 to 24.5 mmol/L when sodium chloride was added. In contrast, when the aqueous volume of a bicarbonate solution gassed with 5% CO2 was decreased by isohydric albumin, the total CO2 content was not reduced. We hypothesize that carbamino-compounds were formed with albumin and this raised the volume of CO2 released by an excess of acid. Therefore, the calculated pK' for the bicarbonate buffer system, which is derived from solutions lacking proteins, is not solely determined by the concentrations of bicarbonate, dissolved CO2, carbonate and carbonic acid when albumin is present. The clinical implications of these results will be discussed.";-;-;-;hard_0
2135;18685104;Specific mutations within the AT-rich region of a plasmid replication origin affect either origin opening or helicase loading.;Prokaryotic and eukaryotic replicons possess a distinctive region containing a higher than average number of adenine and thymine residues (the AT-rich region) where, during the process of replication initiation, the initial destabilization (opening) of the double helix takes place. In many prokaryotic origins, this region consists of repeated 13-mer motifs whose function has not yet been specified. Here we identify specific mutations within the 13-mer sequences of the broad-host-range plasmid RK2 that can result in defective origin opening or that do not affect opening but induce defects in helicase loading. We also show that after the initial recruitment of helicase at the DnaA-box sequences of the plasmid origin, the helicase is translocated to the AT-rich region in a reaction requiring specific sequence of the 13-mers and appropriate facing of the origin motifs. Our results demonstrate that specific sequences within the AT-rich region of a replication origin are required for either origin opening or helicase loading. ;polythreonine;helix;-;LCR_with_function

2143;16823044;Secondary structure determines protein topology.;"Using a test set of 13 small, compact proteins, we demonstrate that a remarkably simple protocol can capture native topology from secondary structure information alone, in the absence of long-range interactions. It has been a long-standing open question whether such information is sufficient to determine a protein's fold. Indeed, even the far simpler problem of reconstructing the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its exact backbone torsion angles has remained a difficult challenge owing to the small, but cumulative, deviations from ideality in backbone planarity, which, if ignored, cause large errors in structure. As a familiar example, a small change in an elbow angle causes a large displacement at the end of your arm; the longer the arm, the larger the displacement. Here, correct secondary structure assignments (alpha-helix, beta-strand, beta-turn, polyproline II, coil) were used to constrain polypeptide backbone chains devoid of side chains, and the most stable folded conformations were determined, using Monte Carlo simulation. Just three terms were used to assess stability: molecular compaction, steric exclusion, and hydrogen bonding. For nine of the 13 proteins, this protocol restricts the main chain to a surprisingly small number of energetically favorable topologies, with the native one prominent among them.

2145;8918802;The importance of the linker connecting the repeats of the c-Myb oncoprotein may be due to a positioning function.;The DNA-binding domain of the oncoprotein c-Myb consists of three imperfect tryptophan-rich repeats, R1, R2 and R3. Each repeat forms an independent mini-domain with a helix-turn-helix related motif and they are connected by linkers containing highly conserved residues. The location of the linker between two DNA-binding units suggests a function analogous to a dimerisation motif with a critical role in positioning the recognition helices of each mini-domain. Mutational analysis of the minimal DNA-binding domain of chicken c-Myb (R2 and R3), revealed that besides the recognition helices of each repeat, the linker connecting them was of critical importance in maintaining specific DNA-binding. A comparison of several linker sequences from different Myb proteins revealed a highly conserved motif of four amino acids in the first half of the linker: LNPE (L138 to E141 in chicken c-Myb R2R3). Substitution of residues within this sequence led to reduced stability of protein-DNA complexes and even loss of DNA-binding. The two most affected mutants showed increased accessibility to proteases, and fluorescence emission spectra and quenching experiments revealed greater average exposure of tryptophans which suggests changes in conformation of the proteins. From the structure of R2R3 we propose that the LNPE motif provides two functions: anchorage to the first repeat (through L) and determination of the direction of the bridge to the next repeat (through P).;polytryptophan;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

A mass treatment with ivermectin has been undertaken in 1989 in two villages, where pretreatment community microfilarial loads (CMFL) were 5.5 and 25.1 microfilariae per snip. The parasitological examination carried out 32 months later showed that the microfilarial densities in the adults where only 24 and 51% of the initial values, respectively. In a third village, treated once in 1989 but located in an area where annual mass distributions of ivermectin have been undertaken since 1987, the mean microfilarial density 28 months after treatment was only 12% of the initial value. In 1992, the mean microfilarial load in children had decreased significantly in comparison with those of 1989 only in the village where the level of endemicity was initially the lowest. The rate of increase in the number of skin microfilariae after one dose of ivermectin is related with the pretreatment endemicity level. The impact of large-scale ivermectin treatments on the transmission of onchocerciasis enhances the long-term efficacy of this drug on the skin microfilarial densities.;-;-;-;hard_0

The proposed control strategy is based on off-line system identification using neural networks (NN's) and nonlinear model predictive controller design. The system identification framework combines the concept of nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous inputs (NARX) system representation, regularization approach for constructing radial basis function NN's, and validation methods for nonlinear systems. Numerical studies on system identification and closed-loop control of glucose were carried out using a comprehensive model of glucose regulation and a pharmacokinetic model for the absorption of monomeric insulin analogs from the s.c. depot. The system identification procedure enabled construction of a parsimonious network from the simulated data, and consequently, design of a controller using multiple-step-ahead predictions of the previously identified model. According to the simulation results, stable control is achievable in the presence of large noise levels, for unknown or variable time delays as well as for slow time variations of the controlled process. However, the control limitations due to the s.c. insulin administration makes additional action from the patient at meal time necessary.;-;-;-;hard_0

Of them, the Gallois' and Bosquette's arch bundle, or the main tensile trabecular group, has particular diagnostic importance. We studied 25 femoral neck fractures in people aged 62 to 95 years, mostly women (22 patients) and classified the osteoporotic status of the proximal femur according to Singh index (grades IV, III, II, I). The regressive changes exhibited by the main tensile trabecular group were an early depauperation of the trajectorial trabeculae (7 cases), evolving into bundle disruption (13 cases) and then into its complete disappearance (5 cases). No correlation was found between age and anatomical changes in the patients experiencing physical activity, not even in our oldest patients. These radiologic studies provide detailed information on the main tensile trabecular group changes which can thus be identified as a good predictor of osteoporotic fractures of the femoral neck.;-;-;-;hard_0
2152;9585406;Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling factors including Ran and CRM1 mediate nuclear export of NFAT In vitro.;We have developed a permeabilized cell assay to study the nuclear export of the shuttling transcription factor NFAT, which contains a leucine-rich export signal. The assay uses HeLa cells that are stably transfected with NFAT fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP). Nuclear export of GFP-NFAT in digitonin-permeabilized cells occurs in a temperature- and ATP-dependent manner and can be quantified by flow cytometry. In vitro NFAT export requires the GTPase Ran, which is released from cells during the digitonin permeabilization. At least one additional rate-limiting export factor is depleted from permeabilized cells by a preincubation at 30 degrees C in the absence of cytosol. This activity can be provided by cytosolic or nucleoplasmic extracts in a subsequent export step. Using this assay, we have purified a second major export activity from cytosol. We found that it corresponds to CRM1, a protein recently reported to be a receptor for certain leucine-rich export sequences. CRM1 appears to be imported into the nucleus by a Ran-dependent mechanism that is distinct from conventional signaling pathways. Considered together, our studies directly demonstrate by fractionation and reconstitution that nuclear export of NFAT is mediated by multiple nucleocytoplasmic shuttling factors, including Ran and CRM1.; polyleucine ;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

Although surgical resection is curative for well-circumscribed superficial lesions, tumors that are infiltrative or arise from deep structures are therapeutically challenging, and new treatment approaches are needed. Having identified a panel of glioma-associated antigens (GAAs) overexpressed in these tumors, we initiated a pilot trial of vaccinations with peptides for GAA epitopes in human leukocyte antigen-A2+ children with recurrent LGG that had progressed after at least 2 prior regimens. Peptide epitopes for 3 GAAs (EphA2, IL-13Rα2, and survivin) were emulsified in Montanide-ISA-51 and administered subcutaneously adjacent to intramuscular injections of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid stabilized by lysine and carboxymethylcellulose every 3 weeks for 8 courses, followed by booster vaccines every 6 weeks. Primary endpoints were safety and T-lymphocyte responses against GAA epitopes. Treatment response was evaluated clinically and by MRI. Fourteen children were enrolled. Other than grade 3 urticaria in one child, no regimen-limiting toxicity was encountered. Vaccination induced immunoreactivity to at least one vaccine-targeted GAA in all 12 evaluable patients: to IL-13Rα2 in 3, EphA2 in 11, and survivin in 3. One child with a metastatic LGG had asymptomatic pseudoprogression noted 6 weeks after starting vaccination, followed by dramatic disease regression with >75% shrinkage of primary tumor and regression of metastatic disease, persisting >57 months. Three other children had sustained partial responses, lasting >10, >31, and >45 months, and one had a transient response.

Interestingly, we find a marked departure in the kinase activity between G2019S-LRRK2 homo-dimers and wild-type-G2019S hetero-dimers. While the homo-dimeric G2019S-LRRK2 exhibits the typical robust enhancement of kinase activity, hetero-dimers comprised of wild-type (WT) and G2019S-LRRK2 exhibit kinase activity similar to WT.

2166;34206916;Loss of CENP-I Impairs Homologous Recombination and Sensitizes Cells to PARP1 Inhibition.;Centromere Protein I (CENP-I) is a member of the CENP-H/I/K complex. CENP-H/I/K is a major component of the inner kinetochore and aids in ensuring proper chromosomal segregation during mitosis. In addition to this chromosomal segregation function, CENP-I also plays a role in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. Loss of CENP-I leads to increased endogenous 53BP1 foci and R-loop formation, while reducing cellular survival after ionizing radiation and Niraparib, a PARP1 small molecule inhibitor, exposures. Cells lacking CENP-I display delayed 53BP1 foci regression, an indication that DSB repair is impaired. Additionally, loss of CENP-I impairs the homologous recombination DSB repair pathway, while having no effect on the non-homologous end-joining pathway. Interestingly, we find that RNaseH1 expression restores HR capacity in CENP-I deficient cells. Importantly, CENP-I expression is elevated in glioma tissue as compared to normal brain tissue. This elevated expression also correlates with poor overall patient survival. These data highlight the multi-functional role CENP-I plays in maintaining genetic, as well as chromosomal, stability and tumor survival.;-;-;-;hard_0
2168;7516896;The lamin B receptor-associated protein p34 shares sequence homology and antigenic determinants with the splicing factor 2-associated protein p32.;The lamin B receptor (p58) is an inner nuclear membrane protein that forms an in vivo complex with the nuclear lamins, a nuclear envelope kinase, and two other nuclear proteins with apparent M(r) of 18,000 (p18) and 34,000 (p34). We now report the isolation of p34 by partial dissociation of the immunoaffinity-purified p58 protein complex. Determination of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of purified p34 shows that this polypeptide is homologous to p32, a splicing factor 2 (SF2)-associated protein. The relatedness between p34 and p32 can be further established by showing that antibodies raised against N- and C-terminal peptides of p32 cross-react with purified p34. As the amino acid sequence of p58 contains an arginine/serine (RS)-rich region similar to the RS-rich region found in SF 2, we speculate that these domains provide binding sites for p34 and that this protein may be a linker between the nuclear membrane and intranuclear spliceosomal substructures. ;polyserine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
2169;10837845;Depressive characteristics of FSL rats: involvement of central nicotinic receptors.;Antidepressant effects of acute or chronic nicotine treatments in swim test immobility of Flinders sensitive line (FSL) rats, an animal model of depression, were recently demonstrated (Tizabi et al. Psychopharmacology 142:193, 1999). In the present study we sought to determine whether the antidepressant effects of nicotine could be blocked by the nicotinic antagonist, mecamylamine (MEC). Moreover, the effects of chronic nicotine treatment on [3H]cytisine binding in discrete brain regions of FSL and their control Flinders resistant line (FRL) rats were also evaluated. Adult male FSL rats were treated with MEC (0.5 mg/kg) 20 min prior to an acute or chronic nicotine administration. MEC by itself did not affect the immobility in swim test. However, it completely blocked the acute or chronic nicotine effects. Daily nicotine injection (0.4 mg/kg/day for 14 days) resulted in an increase in [3H]cytisine binding primarily in the FRL rats. An increase in nicotinic receptor binding following chronic nicotine administration is believed to reflect desensitization of these receptors. These findings, coupled with previous observation of higher basal nicotinic receptors in FSL rats, further support the involvement of central nicotinic receptors in depressive characteristics of these rats. Moreover, the data suggest therapeutic potential for selective nicotinic receptor agonists in depressive disorders.;-;-;-;hard_0
2173;27469890;Aspergillus fumigatus spore proteomics and genetics reveal that VeA represses DefA-mediated DNA damage response.;Aspergillus fumigatus reproduces and infects host by forming a high number of small asexual spores (conidia). The velvet proteins are global transcriptional regulators governing the complex process of conidiogenesis in this fungus. Here, to further understand the velvet-mediated regulation, we carried out comparative proteomic analyses of conidia of wild type (WT) and three velvet mutants (ΔveA, ΔvelB and ΔvosA). Cluster analysis of 184 protein spots showing at least 1.5-fold differential accumulation between WT and mutants reveal the clustering of WT- ΔveA and ΔvelB-ΔvosA. Among 43 proteins identified by Nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS, 23 including several heat shock proteins showed more than two-fold reduction in both the ∆velB and ∆vosA conidia. On the contrary, three proteins exhibited more than five-fold increase in ∆veA only, including the putative RNA polymerase II degradation factor DefA. The deletion of defA resulted in a reduced number of conidia and restricted colony growth. In addition, the defA deletion mutant conidia showed hypersensitivity against the DNA damaging agents NQO and MMS, while the ΔveA mutant conidia were more resistant against to NQO. Taken together, we propose that VeA controls protein level of DefA in conidia, which are dormant and equipped with multiple layers of protection against environmental cues.;-;-;-;hard_0
2174;12406575;Interactions of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D-like protein JKTBP and its domains with high-affinity binding sites.;JKTBP proteins consisting of two canonical RNA binding domains (RBDs) and a glycine-rich carboxyl domain are nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins. We studied in vivo and in vitro interactions between JKTBP and RNA. UV cross-linking experiments on HL-60 cells indicated that following RNA synthesis inhibition by actinomycin D, JKTBP1 accumulated in the cytoplasam is bound to poly(A)(+) RNAs. Recombinant JKTBP1 protein blots could bind poly(A)(+) RNAs, but not poly(A)(-) RNAs. For examination of RNA binding specificity of JKTBP, we enriched high binding sites from pools of 20 nt random sequence-containing RNAs by a selection/amplification method. After eight rounds of a selection and amplification, >20 sequences for each of JKTBPs 1 and 2 were identified. Their consensus high-affinity site was ACUAGC. Approximate K(d)s of JKTBPs 2 and 1 were estimated to be 6-12 nM for the selected sequences by filter binding assays. JKTBP deletion analysis indicated that not individual RBDs, both RBDs and the N-terminal 15 amino acids of the carboxyl domain are required for sequence-specific and high-affinity binding. These results indicate that JKTBP is a sequence-specific RNA binding protein differing from the related heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins A1 and D. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

2181;34597396;The OsSPK1-OsRac1-RAI1 defense signaling pathway is shared by two distantly related NLR proteins in rice blast resistance.;Resistance (R) proteins are important components of plant innate immunity. Most known R proteins are nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins. Although a number of signaling components downstream of NLRs have been identified, we lack a general understanding of the signaling pathways. Here, we used the interaction between rice (Oryza sativa) and Magnaporthe oryzae to study signaling of rice NLRs in response to blast infection. We found that in blast resistance mediated by the NLR PIRICULARIA ORYZAE RESISTANCE IN DIGU 3 (PID3), the guanine nucleotide exchange factor OsSPK1 works downstream of PID3. OsSPK1 activates the small GTPase OsRac1, which in turn transduces the signal to the transcription factor RAC IMMUNITY1 (RAI1). Further investigation revealed that the three signaling components also play important roles in disease resistance mediated by the distantly related NLR protein Pi9, suggesting that the OsSPK1-OsRac1-RAI1 signaling pathway could be conserved across rice NLR-induced blast resistance. In addition, we observed changes in RAI1 levels during blast infection, which led to identification of OsRPT2a, a subunit of the 19S regulatory particle of the 26S proteasome. OsRPT2a seemed to be responsible for RAI1 turnover in a 26S proteasome-dependent manner. Collectively, our results suggest a defense signaling route that might be common to NLR proteins in response to blast infection.;polyleucine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

The first and second litters in the F(1) generation and in the F(2) generation showed an enhanced immune response. When poly-lysine was used as the aggregating agent, enhancement occurred in only the first litter of the F(1) generation and in the F(2) generation. In both cases, antigen was transmitted from the immunized female to her offspring, where it localized in the bone marrow and, in a few cases, in the thymus and spleen also. The transplacental passage of antigen is probably the basis for the enhanced antibody response, which is a manifestation of immunological memory. ;polylysine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
2183;36328080;Structural insights on the selective interaction of the histidine-rich piscidin antimicrobial peptide Of-Pis1 with membranes.;Of-Pis1 is a potent piscidin antimicrobial peptide (AMP), recently isolated from rock bream (Oplegnathus fasciatus). This rich in histidines and glycines 24-amino acid peptide displays high and broad antimicrobial activity and no significant hemolytic toxicity against human erythrocytes, suggesting low toxicity. To better understand the mechanism of action of Of-Pis1 and its potential selectivity, using NMR and CD spectroscopies, we studied the interaction with eukaryotic and procaryotic membranes and membrane models. Anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) micelles were used to mimic procaryotic membranes, while zwitterionic dodecyl phosphocholine (DPC) was used as eukaryotic membrane surrogate. In an aqueous environment, Of-Pis1 adopts a flexible random coil conformation. In DPC and SDS instead, the N-terminal region of Of-Pis1 forms an amphipathic α-helix with the non-polar face in close contact with the micelles. Slower solvent exchange and higher pKas of the histidine residues in SDS than in DPC suggest that Of-Pis1 interacts more tightly with SDS. Of-Pis1 also binds tightly and structurally perturbs LPS micelles. Of-Pis1 interacts with both Escherichia coli and mammalian cell membranes, but only in the presence of Escherichia coli membranes it populates the helical conformation. Furthermore, ligand-based NMR experiments support a tighter and more specific interaction with bacterial than with eukaryotic membranes. Overall, these data clearly show the selective interaction of this broadly active AMP with bacterial over eukaryotic membranes. The conformational information is discussed in terms of Of-Pis1 amino acid sequence and composition to provide insights useful to design more potent and selective AMPs.;polyhistidine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
2186;21931216;Structural studies of human glioma pathogenesis-related protein 1.;Human glioma pathogenesis-related protein 1 (GLIPR1) is a membrane protein that is highly upregulated in brain cancers but is barely detectable in normal brain tissue. GLIPR1 is composed of a signal peptide that directs its secretion, a conserved cysteine-rich CAP (cysteine-rich secretory proteins, antigen 5 and pathogenesis-related 1 proteins) domain and a transmembrane domain. GLIPR1 is currently being investigated as a candidate for prostate cancer gene therapy and for glioblastoma targeted therapy. Crystal structures of a truncated soluble domain of the human GLIPR1 protein (sGLIPR1) solved by molecular replacement using a truncated polyalanine search model of the CAP domain of stecrisp, a snake-venom cysteine-rich secretory protein (CRISP), are presented. The correct molecular-replacement solution could only be obtained by removing all loops from the search model. The native structure was refined to 1.85 Å resolution and that of a Zn2+ complex was refined to 2.2 Å resolution. The latter structure revealed that the putative binding cavity coordinates Zn2+ similarly to snake-venom CRISPs, which are involved in Zn2+-dependent mechanisms of inflammatory modulation. Both sGLIPR1 structures have extensive flexible loop/turn regions and unique charge distributions that were not observed in any of the previously reported CAP protein structures. A model is also proposed for the structure of full-length membrane-bound GLIPR1. ;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
2188;6130472;Thy-1 cDNA sequence suggests a novel regulatory mechanism.;Thy-1 was originally defined in mice as a cell-surface alloantigen of thymus and brain with two allelic forms, Thy-1.1 and Thy-1.2 (ref. 1). Subsequently, the Thy-1.1 alloantigenic determinant was identified in rats. In both species, Thy-1 is present in large amounts on thymus and brain cells and in smaller quantities on fibroblasts, epidermal cells, mammary glands and immature skeletal muscle. In many of these tissues the level of Thy-1 expression changes dramatically during cell differentiation. The molecules expressing the Thy-1 antigenic determinant have been isolated from rat and mouse brain cells and have been shown to have a molecular weight of 17,500 (ref. 8). One-third of the Thy-1 molecule is carbohydrate and the remainder is a polypeptide of 111 amino acids whose sequence has been fully determined. We report here the isolation and characterization of a cDNA clone encoding the rat thymus Thy-1 antigen but find that the DNA sequence ends prematurely at a position corresponding to amino acid 103.

2194;9187654;Structure of the hepatitis C virus RNA helicase domain.;Helicases are nucleotide triphosphate (NTP)-dependent enzymes responsible for unwinding duplex DNA and RNA during genomic replication. The 2.1 A resolution structure of the HCV helicase from the positive-stranded RNA hepatitis C virus reveals a molecule with distinct NTPase and RNA binding domains. The structure supports a mechanism of helicase activity involving initial recognition of the requisite 3' single-stranded region on the nucleic acid substrate by a conserved arginine-rich sequence on the RNA binding domain. Comparison of crystallographically independent molecules shows that rotation of the RNA binding domain involves conformational changes within a conserved TATPP sequence and untwisting of an extended antiparallel beta-sheet. Location of the TATPP sequence at the end of an NTPase domain beta-strand structurally homologous to the 'switch region' of many NTP-dependent enzymes offers the possibility that domain rotation is coupled to NTP hydrolysis in the helicase catalytic cycle. ;polyarginine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
2199;8387162;Neuroanatomical substrate for the dorsal light response. I. Differential afferent connections of the lateral lobe of the valvula cerebelli in goldfish (Carassius auratus).;"The afferent connections of the lateral lobe of the valvula cerebelli in goldfish were investigated by retrograde labeling with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Retrogradely labeled neurons were observed ipsilaterally in the lateral nucleus of the valvula and contralaterally in the inferior olivary nucleus after HRP injection into all parts of the lateral valvula. The valvulopetal projections from these nuclei were topographically arranged. After HRP injection confined to the rostral half of the lateral valvula, labeled neurons were also found ipsilaterally in the octavolateral and trigeminal cell groups: the eminentia granularis, the medial nucleus of the octavolateralis column, and the isthmic primary sensory trigeminal nucleus. HRP injection confined to the caudal half of the lateral valvula resulted in retrograde labeling of the following vision-related cell groups; the central pretectal nucleus, nucleus paracommissuralis, and the nucleus isthmi. However, the octavolateral and trigeminal cell groups did not project to the caudal half of the lateral valvula. These data provide insight into central nervous integration of visual and vestibular information, and help reveal the mechanism of the dorsal light response (DLR). Bilateral lesions of either the valvula cerebelli or pretectal area completely abolish this visually-guided response, but lesions of the optic tectum have no such effect. The pretectal nuclei (central pretectal nucleus, nucleus paracommissuralis) project to the lateral valvula directly, not via the optic tectum. These direct projections from the pretectal accessory optic nuclei to the lateral valvula may control the DLR. On the other hand, the lateral valvula receives vestibular and lateral line inputs indirectly, via the eminentia granularis and the medial nucleus of the octavolateralis column, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)";-;-;-;hard_0
2202;25481825;Circulating antibodies against Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich proteins 2 interfere with antigen detection by rapid diagnostic tests.;Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for detection of Plasmodium falciparum infection that target P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2), a protein that circulates in the blood of patients infected with this species of malaria, are widely used to guide case management. Understanding determinants of PfHRP2 availability in circulation is therefore essential to understanding the performance of PfHRP2-detecting RDTs. The possibility that pre-formed host anti-PfHRP2 antibodies may block target antigen detection, thereby causing false negative test results was investigated in this study. Anti-PfHRP2 antibodies were detected in 19/75 (25%) of plasma samples collected from patients with acute malaria from Cambodia, Nigeria and the Philippines, as well as in 3/28 (10.7%) asymptomatic Solomon Islands residents. Pre-incubation of plasma samples from subjects with high-titre anti-PfHRP2 antibodies with soluble PfHRP2 blocked the detection of the target antigen on two of the three brands of RDTs tested, leading to false negative results. Pre-incubation of the plasma with intact parasitized erythrocytes resulted in a reduction of band intensity at the highest parasite density, and a reduction of lower detection threshold by ten-fold on all three brands of RDTs tested. These observations indicate possible reduced sensitivity for diagnosis of P. falciparum malaria using PfHRP2-detecting RDTs among people with high levels of specific antibodies and low density infection, as well as possible interference with tests configured to detect soluble PfHRP2 in saliva or urine samples. Further investigations are required to assess the impact of pre-formed anti-PfHRP2 antibodies on RDT performance in different transmission settings. ;polyhistidine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
2203;23721653;The DEAD-box protein Dbp2 functions with the RNA-binding protein Yra1 to promote mRNP assembly.;Eukaryotic gene expression involves numerous biochemical steps that are dependent on RNA structure and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex formation. The DEAD-box class of RNA helicases plays fundamental roles in formation of RNA and RNP structure in every aspect of RNA metabolism. In an effort to explore the diversity of biological roles for DEAD-box proteins, our laboratory recently demonstrated that the DEAD-box protein Dbp2 associates with actively transcribing genes and is required for normal gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We now provide evidence that Dbp2 interacts genetically and physically with the mRNA export factor Yra1. In addition, we find that Dbp2 is required for in vivo assembly of mRNA-binding proteins Yra1, Nab2, and Mex67 onto poly(A)+ RNA. Strikingly, we also show that Dbp2 is an efficient RNA helicase in vitro and that Yra1 decreases the efficiency of ATP-dependent duplex unwinding. We provide a model whereby messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) assembly requires Dbp2 unwinding activity and once the mRNP is properly assembled, inhibition by Yra1 prevents further rearrangements. Both Yra1 and Dbp2 are conserved in multicellular eukaryotes, suggesting that this constitutes a broadly conserved mechanism for stepwise assembly of mature mRNPs in the nucleus.  ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
2206;8063568;Using Medicaid claims data to evaluate a large physician fee increase.;"OBJECTIVE
This study demonstrates the use of Medicaid claims data in order to evaluate a threefold fee increase in physician fees for deliveries ($265 to $795), which the Maryland Medicaid program implemented in 1986.


DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SETTING
The study used Maryland Medicaid claims data for years of service 1985-1988, and was done at the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene with the help of a Robert Wood Johnson, Health Care Financing and Organization (HCFO) grant.


STUDY DESIGN
Overall, our design is that of a pre-test, post-test with multiple observation points both before and after the fee increase. We measured participation in three ways, corresponding to three different units of analysis. With the county-quarter year as unit of analysis, we followed a panel of providers over 16 quarters for each county in the state to determine changes in the number of delivering providers. With the individual provider as the unit of analysis, we identified effects on their Medicaid caseload between years that may have been influenced by the fee increase. Finally, we looked at continuously enrolled Medicaid women who delivered to determine the effects of the fee increase on site and volume of prenatal care.


DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS
Analytic files for each unit of analysis were compiled from previously extracted Medicaid claims files using standard statistical software packages.


PRINCIPAL FINDINGS
Using techniques described, we were able to get an in-depth picture of overall responsiveness to the intervention. We found a moderate influence of the fee increase on overall participation, less than what we would have predicted.


CONCLUSIONS
Administrative data can be used to construct efficient, yet sophisticated evaluations of major policy changes. Findings from our evaluation suggest a moderate effect of the fee increase on overall participation. However, raising fees to the level of private third party payers does not in itself guarantee equal access to private physician health care for Medicaid mothers.";-;-;-;hard_0
2215;8180504;Coronary restenosis and gene therapy.;Restenosis continues to limit the efficacy of coronary angioplasty, despite the various mechanical and pharmaceutical interventions that have been employed. The migration, proliferation, and extracellular matrix production by vascular smooth muscle cells are processes integral to restenosis, and sustained local delivery of drugs at high concentration should curtail these vascular responses to balloon angioplasty. Our laboratory and others are exploring the potential of using somatic cell gene therapy to provide such treatment and thereby prevent restenosis. However, conventional methods of gene transfer fail to produce physiologic levels of recombinant protein in vivo. This obstacle might be overcome by using adenoviral vectors to mediate efficient direct gene transfer. Herein we summarize these developments and focus upon our laboratory's progress towards evaluating adenovirus-mediated gene therapy in porcine coronary arteries. Recombinant adenoviruses directing the expression of the beta-galactosidase and luciferase reporter genes were evaluated in cultured coronary vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro and in porcine coronary arteries in vivo. Following percutaneous transluminal gene transfer in vivo, recombinant adenoviruses were shown to produce 70- to 240-fold more reporter protein than that produced by Lipofectin-DNA complexes. Furthermore, the high levels of adenovirus-mediated gene expression were shown to persist for at least 14 days following catheterization. Additional histologic studies will be required to determine the cellular distribution of gene expression and to elucidate potential interactions between adenovirus and the host's immune system, but recombinant adenovirus appears to be a promising vector for evaluating gene therapy against coronary restenosis.;-;-;-;hard_0

Within 4 hr of intraduodenal challenge with 4 day old N. Brasiliensis greater than 85% of the worms were expelled from rats immunized by infection 18 days previously with 4000-6000 third stage larvae. Rapid expulsion was unaffected by the challenge dose but waned with time after primary infection. Histological observations suggested that the parasites were excluded from their predilection site between the villi in immune rats and that they were separated from the mucosa by a superficial layer of mucus. A newly developed intestinal wash-out technique demonstrated that the 70%-80% of worms in previously uninfected controls were adherent to the mucosa whereas in immune rats 28%-36% of the parasites were adherent and 3%-23% were trapped in mucus. These experiments establish that immune exclusion and mucus trapping are early events in the expulsion process. The possible mechanisms controlling these phenomena are discussed.;-;-;-;hard_0

2223;18518926;Additive effect of BDNF and REST polymorphisms is associated with improved general cognitive ability.;Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a pleiotropic protein involved in neuronal proliferation, differentiation, synaptic plasticity and survival. Independent studies investigating association between the functional BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and cognitive abilities have reported some conflicting findings, which may reflect inadequate sample size, variation in testing methods, population stratification or the confounding effects of other genes. To test the latter hypothesis, we screened and genotyped polymorphisms in the RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) gene whose function includes the downregulation of BDNF expression. We identified an exon 4 hexadecapeptide variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) with either four or five copies that was located within a proline-rich domain and investigated a further five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Using a cohort of 746 community-dwelling older volunteers, we analysed REST genotype data both independently and in combination with the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism. A haplotype within the REST gene containing the four copy VNTR and a non-synonymous SNP showed a weak but significant association with a higher score of general intelligence (P = 0.05). Analysis of this haplotype and the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism in combination showed a significant interaction (global P-value = 0.0003) with an additive increase in cognitive performance for those possessing the BDNF Val66 allele and the REST haplotype containing the four copy repeat (P = 0.004). The REST haplotypes in combination with the BDNF Met66 polymorphism did not reduce cognitive performance more than the independent influence of the Met66 allele. Our results suggest that investigation of a common REST polymorphism may be necessary to help reduce contrasting reports based around BDNF Val66Met and cognition. ;polyproline;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

The functions of PLATZ proteins in growth, development, and adaptation to multiple abiotic stresses have been investigated in various plant species, but their role in tomato has not been explored yet. In the present work, 20 non-redundant Solanum lycopersicum&amp;nbsp;PLATZ (SlPLATZ) genes with three segmentally duplicated gene pairs and four tandemly duplicated gene pairs were identified on eight tomato chromosomes. The comparative modeling and gene ontology (GO) annotations of tomato PLATZ proteins indicated their probable roles in defense response, transcriptional regulation, and protein metabolic processes as well as their binding affinity for various ligands, including nucleic acids, peptides, and zinc. SlPLATZ10 and SlPLATZ17 were only expressed in 1 cm fruits and flowers, respectively, indicating their preferential involvement in the development of these organs. The expression of SlPLATZ1, SlPLATZ12, and SlPLATZ19 was up- or down-regulated following exposure to various abiotic stresses, whereas that of SlPLATZ11 was induced under temperature stresses (i.e., cold and heat stress), revealing their probable function in the abiotic stress tolerance of tomato. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis corroborated the aforementioned findings by spotlighting the co-expression of several stress-associated genes with SlPLATZ genes. Confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed the localization of SlPLATZ-GFP fusion proteins in the nucleus, hinting at their functions as transcription factors. These findings provide a foundation for a better understanding of the structure and function of PLATZ genes and should assist in the selection of potential candidate genes involved in the development and abiotic stress adaptation in tomato.";polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
2227;9783584;Imaging unconscious semantic priming.;Visual words that are masked and presented so briefly that they cannot be seen may nevertheless facilitate the subsequent processing of related words, a phenomenon called masked priming. It has been debated whether masked primes can activate cognitive processes without gaining access to consciousness. Here we use a combination of behavioural and brain-imaging techniques to estimate the depth of processing of masked numerical primes. Our results indicate that masked stimuli have a measurable influence on electrical and haemodynamic measures of brain activity. When subjects engage in an overt semantic comparison task with a clearly visible target numeral, measures of covert motor activity indicate that they also unconsciously apply the task instructions to an unseen masked numeral. A stream of perceptual, semantic and motor processes can therefore occur without awareness.;-;-;-;hard_0
2230;10719280;Immunochemical characterization of assay for carboxyterminal telopeptide of human type I collagen: loss of antigenicity by treatment with cathepsin K.;"The assay for the cross-linked carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP) has been shown to reflect increased type I collagen degradation in such pathological conditions as bone metastases and rheumatoid arthritis, but to be rather insensitive to the changes in physiological bone collagen turnover (e.g., induced by estrogen or bisphosphonate treatment). To determine the reasons for this discrepancy we localized the antigenic determinant recognized by the ICTP assay and studied the effects of two major osteoclastic proteinases, cathepsin K (EC 3.4.22.38) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9; gelatinase B; EC 3.4.24.35), on immunoreactivity. The antigenic determinant was shown to reside within the hydrophobic phenylalanine-rich regions of the carboxyterminal telopeptides of the two alpha1 chains of human type I collagen, situated between the triple helical domain and the lysine-derived trivalent cross-link. This conclusion was based on differences between the amino acid sequences and cross reactivities of the corresponding human and bovine antigens before and after proteolytic treatments with chymotrypsin. A trivalent cross-link is necessary for providing such a structure, because the divalently cross-linked and monomeric natural and synthetic peptides from the same region, but containing only one phenylalanine-rich sequence, showed poor immunoreaction. Recombinant human cathepsin K cleaved the trivalently cross-linked ICTP structure at two sites between the phenylalanine-rich region and the cross-link, destroying the reactivity with ICTP antibodies. On the contrary, the treatment of isolated ICTP by the matrix metalloproteinases MMP-9 (gelatinase B), MMP-1 (collagenase 1), or MMP-13 (collagenase 3) had no effect on the immunoreaction.

2231;8183647;Oxygen consumption of oestradiol-treated rats.;Rectal temperature and oxygen consumption (Vo2) were monitored in female rats acclimated either to cold or to thermoneutrality and with and without chronic administration of oestradiol. The hormone is known to inactivate brown adipose tissue (BAT) and to reduce its response to noradrenaline (NA). The role of sympathetic control was studied by administering NA or the adrenergic blocker propranolol. Oestradiol treatment did not affect rectal temperature in the states of acclimation to thermoneutrality and to cold, nor did it change the hypothermic response of cold-exposed rats to temporary food deprivation. In the cold-acclimated rats, both controls and oestradiol-treated animals exhibited similar degrees of metabolic reduction after propranolol administration in the cold and similar degrees of metabolic activation by NA at thermoneutrality. Rats acclimated to thermoneutrality showed a larger metabolic response to NA when treated with oestradiol. The results suggest that oestradiol, while inactivating the BAT response to NA, activates the NA responsiveness of other metabolically active tissues in cold-induced thermogenesis. The observation of a greater oxidative capacity in the kidney and the rectus abdominis muscle of oestradiol-treated, cold-acclimated rats would be in line with this proposal.;-;-;-;hard_0
2238;14736876;A WT1 co-regulator controls podocyte phenotype by shuttling between adhesion structures and nucleus.;Glomerular podocyte differentiation state is critical for filtration barrier function and is regulated by WT1, a zinc finger transcription factor. A yeast two-hybrid assay identified a novel, WT1-interacting protein (WTIP) that maps to human chromosome 19q13.1, a region with genes linked to familial focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. The domain structure of WTIP is similar to the zyxin subfamily of cytosolic LIM domain-containing proteins, which contain three carboxyl-terminal LIM protein-protein interaction domains and a proline-rich, pre-LIM region with a nuclear export signal. Other LIM domain-containing proteins (zyxin and mouse muscle LIM protein) did not interact with WT1 in two-hybrid assays, and WTIP did not interact with an unrelated transcription factor, LMX1B. WTIP mRNA was detected in cultured podocytes and was developmentally regulated, with expression peaking in mouse kidney at embryonic day 15-16 (E15-E16) in kidney but persisting into adulthood. In situ hybridization demonstrated WTIP expression in developing E15 glomeruli and in cultured podocytes. The partial WTIP clone, which interacted with WTIP in the two-hybrid assay, co-localized with WT1 in nuclei, co-precipitated with WT1, and inhibited WT1-dependent transcriptional activation of the amphiregulin promoter. In contrast, full-length WTIP was excluded from cell nuclei, but after the addition of leptomycin B, an inhibitor of Crm1-mediated nuclear export, it accumulated in the nucleus and co-precipitated with WT1 in whole cell lysates. Epitope-tagged WTIP co-localized with the adaptor protein CD2AP (CMS) in podocyte actin spots and with Mena at cell-cell junctions. We propose that WTIP monitors slit diaphragm protein assembly as part of a multiple protein complex, linking this specialized adhesion junction to the actin cytoskeleton, and shuttles into the nucleus after podocyte injury, providing a mechanism whereby changes in slit diaphragm structure modulate gene expression. ;polyproline;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

2241;9353615;Pronounced insulin resistance and inadequate beta-cell secretion characterize lean gestational diabetes during and after pregnancy.;"OBJECTIVE
To evaluate beta-cell secretion and glucose metabolism in lean subjects with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) compared with that in subjects with normal pregnancy and obesity.


RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity (S1), and hepatic insulin extraction were assessed in pregnant women with GDM before and after delivery and in those with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) in comparison to healthy nonpregnant lean and obese women. Kinetic analysis of glucose, insulin, and C-peptide plasma concentrations during oral and intravenous glucose tolerance tests was performed by mathematical modeling.


RESULTS
S1 was blunted in pregnant women with GDM by 84% and in those with NGT by 66% compared with lean nonpregnant women (P < 0.005 vs. healthy nonpregnant lean control subjects; P < 0.05, GDM vs. pregnant women with NGT), whereas glucose effectiveness was decreased by 33% in both pregnant groups (P < 0.05 vs. healthy nonpregnant lean control subjects). Insulin secretion was 30% higher (P < 0.05) in subjects with GDM than in pregnant women with NGT or in nonpregnant lean women, but decreased (P < 0.005) when compared with obese women with a comparable degree of insulin resistance. Fractional hepatic insulin extraction was similar in both pregnant groups, being lower (P < 0.0001) by 30% versus nonpregnant females. beta-cell sensitivity to glucose for insulin release was decreased in subjects with GDM versus pregnant women with NGT as well as nonpregnant women by 40-50% (P < 0.01). Twelve weeks after delivery, GDM returned to normal glucose tolerance, but S1 remained 50% lower than that in lean nonpregnant women, while beta-cell sensitivity to glucose did not change (P < 0.01 vs. healthy nonpregnant lean control subjects).


CONCLUSIONS
Pregnancy is characterized by insulin resistance, diminished hepatic insulin extraction, and glucose effectiveness. Lean subjects with GDM are additionally characterized by having more pronounced insulin resistance and inadequate insulin secretion, which persist after delivery. Compared with other insulin-resistant prediabetic states like impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), defective insulin secretion seems to be a predominant defect in lean GDM subjects, indicating that it might represent a specific prediabetic condition.";-;-;-;hard_0
2247;6516852;Tumor growth inhibition by protein A and non-protein A containing Staphylococcus aureus in a mouse mammary carcinoma model.;Reinfusion of tumor-bearer plasma after absorption with killed Staphylococcus aureus strain Cowan I may be followed by inhibition or even acute necrosis of animal and human tumors. The effect has been attributed to protein A produced in large amounts by this staphylococcus. We have examined the effect upon the growth of a transplanted GR mouse mammary tumor of intraperitoneal inoculation of three strains of S. aureus characterized by being either protein A-rich or protein A-free. A significant tumor growth inhibition was found with all three strains of S. aureus. Serum levels of IgG1, IgG2 and IgM were found to be substantially increased. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis revealed increased numbers and titres of precipitins against staphylococcal antigens. It is concluded that staphylococcal moieties other than protein A may be involved in the tumor growth inhibition. The possibility and role of complement activation by protein A-like molecules through the alternative F(ab)2 reactivity is discussed.; polyalanine ;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
2249;7844145;The Hansenula polymorpha PER8 gene encodes a novel peroxisomal integral membrane protein involved in proliferation.;We previously described the isolation of mutants of the methylotrophic yeast Hansenula polymorpha that are defective in peroxisome biogenesis. Here, we describe the characterization of one of these mutants, per8, and the cloning of the PER8 gene. In either methanol or methylamine medium, conditions that normally induce the organelles, per8 cells contain no peroxisome-like structures and peroxisomal enzymes are located in the cytosol. The sequence of PER8 predicts that its product (Per8p) is a novel polypeptide of 34 kD, and antibodies against Per8p recognize a protein of 31 kD. Analysis of the primary sequence of Per8p revealed a 39-amino-acid cysteine-rich segment with similarity to the C3HC4 family of zinc-finger motifs. Overexpression of PER8 results in a markedly enhanced increase in peroxisome numbers. We show that Per8p is an integral membrane protein of the peroxisome and that it is concentrated in the membranes of newly formed organelles. We propose that Per8p is a component of the molecular machinery that controls the proliferation of this organelle.;polycysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
2250;6205359;Analysis of the variations in proviral cytosine methylation that accompany transformation and morphological reversion in a line of Rous sarcoma virus-infected Rat-1 cells.;"Cells of the A11 lineage of Rat-1 contain a single complete Rous sarcoma provirus. Variation in the activity of this provirus accompanies fluctuations in the lineage between normal and transformed phenotypes. Increased proviral cytosine methylation of the doublet CpG in the tetranucleotide CCGG correlates with transcriptional inactivity and this pattern of cytosine hypermethylation is stable, even when the cells are transformed by another virus. However, transformation can also be induced by 5-azacytidine (but not by other mutagens) and in these transformants reduced proviral cytosine methylation is accompanied by increased proviral transcription. Differences in CCGG methylation between normal and transformed cells are found mainly in the 3' half of the provirus; sites near and within the src gene are heavily methylated only when the provirus is transcriptionally inactive. On the other hand, both transformed and normal A11 derivatives show little, if any, cytosine methylation of CCGG sequences in and flanking the 5' portion of the provirus.";-;-;-;hard_0
2251;8736559;Two structurally different RNA molecules are bound by the spliceosomal protein U1A using the same recognition strategy.;"BACKGROUND
Human U1A protein binds to hairpin II of U1 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and, together with other proteins, forms the U1 snRNP essential in pre-mRNA splicing. U1A protein also binds to the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of its own pre-mRNA, inhibiting polyadenylation of the 3'end and thereby downregulating its own expression. The 3'UTR folds into an evolutionarily conserved secondary structure with two internal loops; one loop contains the sequence AUUGCAC and the other its variant AUUGUAC. The sequence AUUGCAC is also found in hairpin II of U1 snRNA; hence, U1A protein recognizes the same heptanucleotide sequence in two different structural contexts. In order to better understand the control mechanism of the polyadenylation process, we have built a model of the U1A protein-3'UTR complex based on the crystal structure of the U1A protein-hairpin II RNA complex which we determined previously.


RESULTS
In the crystal structure of the U1A protein-hairpin II RNA complex the AUUGCAC sequence fits tightly into a groove on the surface of U1A protein. The conservation of the heptanucleotide in the 3'UTR strongly suggests that U1A protein forms identical sequence-specific contacts with the heptanucleotide sequence when complexed with the 3'UTR. The crystal structure of the hairpin II complex and the twofold symmetry in the 3'UTR RNA provide sufficient information to restrict the conformation of the 3'UTR RNA and have enabled us to build a model of the 3'UTR complex.


CONCLUSIONS
In the U1A-3'UTR complex, sequence-specific interactions are made entirely by the conserved heptanucleotide and the last base pair (C:G) of the stem. The structure is stabilized by protein-protein contacts and by electrostatic interactions between basic amino acids of the protein and the phosphate backbone of the RNA stem regions. The formation of a protein dimer necessary for the inhibition of poly(A) polymerase requires a conformational change of the C termini of the proteins upon RNA binding. This mechanism could prevent the inhibition of poly(A) polymerase by free U1A protein. The model is consistent with biochemical data, and the protein-protein interactions within the 3'UTR complex account for the cooperativity of U1A protein binding to the 3'UTR. The model also serves as an important structural guide for designing further experiments to understand the interaction between the U1A-3'UTR complex and poly(A) polymerase."; polyalanine ;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
2252;21921418;Skipping of an alternative intron in the srsf1 3' untranslated region increases transcript stability.;The srsf1 gene encodes serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1) that participates in both constitutive and alternative splicing reactions. This gene possesses two ultraconserved elements in the 3' untranslated region (UTR). Skipping of an alternative intron between the two elements has no effect on the protein-coding sequence, but it generates a premature stop codon (PTC)-containing mRNA isoform, whose degradation is considered to depend on nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). However, several cell lines (HCT116, RKO, HeLa, and WI38 cells) constitutively expressed significant amounts of the srsf1 PTC variant. HCT116 cells expressed the PTC variant nearly equivalent to the major isoform that includes the alternative intron in the 3' UTR. Inhibition of NMD by silencing a key effecter UPF1 or by treatment with cycloheximide failed to increase amounts of the PTC variant in HCT116 cells, and the PTC variant was rather more stable than the major isoform in the presence of actinomycin D. Our results suggest that the original stop codon may escape from the NMD surveillance even in skipping of the alternative intron. The srsf1 gene may produce an alternative splice variant having truncated 3' UTR to relief the microRNA- and/or RNA-binding protein-mediated control of translation or degradation. ;polyarginine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

2258;10791097;[Formation of neuronal inclusions and neurodegeneration: with special reference to dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy].;A new entity--the conformational disease--an otherwise diverse group of disorders, includes several currently incurable brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, prion encephalopathies and inherited polyglutamine diseases (PGDs) in which it is proposed that conformational changes in certain proteins and their subsequent aggregation represent the common pathogenic mechanism of neurodegeneration. In several PGDs including dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NIIs) have been identified. Here I describe our recent studies on DRPLA. Formation of both intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusions by mutant DRPLA proteins with an expanded polyglutamine stretch was demonstrated in an in vitro experiment. Inclusion-containing non-brain cells were found to undergo apoptosis. In human DRPLA, similar intranuclear inclusions were detected in neurons in various brain regions. However, intracytoplasmic inclusions were found exclusively in neurons in the cerebeller dentate nucleus. The pontine nuclei neurons with NIIs, for instance, appeared to be small (atrophic), but healthy. The question of whether these NIIs actually kill brain cells in the human disease, remains unclear. Recently, NIIs were studied immunohistochemically using antibodies against transcription factors, and were found to contain TAFIIp130, Sp 1 and CREB-1. These results are of great interest when considering not only how the neurodegenerative mechanism progresses but also why the inclusions are located in nuclei in PGDs. Finally, Tsuji and colleagues recently established a transgenic mouse model of DRPLA. In these mice, NIIs, which were identical to those seen in the human disease, were confirmed in various brain regions. Further detailed studies of this model will contribute to a better understanding of the formation of neuronal inclusions and neurodegeneration in DRPLA. ;polyglutamine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
2259;26868665;Atxn2 Knockout and CAG42-Knock-in Cerebellum Shows Similarly Dysregulated Expression in Calcium Homeostasis Pathway.;Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder with preferential affection of Purkinje neurons, which are known as integrators of calcium currents. The expansion of a polyglutamine (polyQ) domain in the RNA-binding protein ataxin-2 (ATXN2) is responsible for this disease, but the causal roles of deficient ATXN2 functions versus aggregation toxicity are still under debate. Here, we studied mouse mutants with Atxn2 knockout (KO) regarding their cerebellar global transcriptome by microarray and RT-qPCR, in comparison with data from Atxn2-CAG42-knock-in (KIN) mouse cerebellum. Global expression downregulations involved lipid and growth signaling pathways in good agreement with previous data. As a novel effect, downregulations of key factors in calcium homeostasis pathways (the transcription factor Rora, transporters Itpr1 and Atp2a2, as well as regulator Inpp5a) were observed in the KO cerebellum, and some of them also occurred subtly early in KIN cerebellum. The ITPR1 protein levels were depleted from soluble fractions of cerebellum in both mutants, but accumulated in its membrane-associated form only in the SCA2 model. Coimmunoprecipitation demonstrated no association of ITPR1 with Q42-expanded or with wild-type ATXN2. These findings provide evidence that the physiological functions and protein interactions of ATXN2 are relevant for calcium-mediated excitation of Purkinje cells as well as for ATXN2-triggered neurotoxicity. These insights may help to understand pathogenesis and tissue specificity in SCA2 and other polyQ ataxias like SCA1, where inositol regulation of calcium flux and RORalpha play a role. ;polyglutamine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
2262;29523191;LRRC15 promotes osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells by modulating p65 cytoplasmic/nuclear translocation.;Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a reliable resource for bone regeneration and tissue engineering, but the molecular mechanisms of differentiation remain unclear. The tumor antigen 15-leucine-rich repeat containing membrane protein (LRRC15) is a transmembrane protein demonstrated to play important roles in cancer. However, little is known about its role in osteogenesis. This study was to evaluate the functions of LRRC15 in osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Osteogenic-induction treatment and the ovariectomized (OVX) model were performed to investigate the potential relationship between LRRC15 and MSC osteogenesis. A loss-of-function study was used to explore the functions of LRRC15 in osteogenic differentiation of MSCs in vitro and in vivo. NF-κB pathway inhibitor BAY117082, siRNA, nucleocytoplasmic separation, and ChIP assays were performed to clarify the molecular mechanism of LRRC15 in bone regulation. Our results first demonstrated that LRRC15 expression was upregulated upon osteogenic induction, and the level of LRRC15 was significantly decreased in OVX mice. Both in-vitro and in-vivo experiments detected that LRRC15 was required for osteogenesis of MSCs. Mechanistically, LRRC15 inhibited transcription factor NF-κB signaling by affecting the subcellular localization of p65. Further studies indicated that LRRC15 regulated osteogenic differentiation in a p65-dependent manner. Taken together, our findings reveal that LRRC15 is an essential regulator for osteogenesis of MSCs through modulating p65 cytoplasmic/nuclear translocation, and give a novel hint for MSC-mediated bone regeneration. ;polyleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

The MBP content of the oligodendroglial fractions was determined by radioimmunoassay. It was found that oligodendroglia prepared from trypsinized fresh brain contained minute amounts of MBP and did not induce disease. The corresponding cell fraction from non-trypsinized frozen brain was rich in MBP and induced disease. Bovine white matter and MBP induced typical experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). The structural preservation of the non-encephalitogenic trypsinized MBP-poor cells was very good and that of the encephalitogenic MBP-rich non-trypsinized cells very poor. It has been concluded that the encephalitogenicity observed was due to MBP, rather than to a specific oligodendroglial antigen. ;polyproline;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

Nuclear poly(A) polymerase from fetal liver, but not from normal liver, was able to compete well with hepatoma enzyme in the radioimmunoassay.

The RRE has been mapped to a conserved region of the HIV-1 env gene and is predicted to form a complex, highly stable RNA stem-loop structure. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to define a small subdomain of the RRE, termed stem-loop II, that is essential for biological activity. Gel retardation assays demonstrated that the Rev trans-activator is a sequence-specific RNA binding protein. The RRE stem-loop II subdomain was found to be both necessary and sufficient for the binding of Rev by the RRE.

Acute exposure to COC (10(-9) to 5 x 10(-3) M) induced contractile responses in isolated canine basilar (BA) and middle cerebral arteries in a dose-dependent manner, but not in mesenteric arteries. The presence or absence of intact endothelium did not alter COC concentration-response curves. The sensitivity to COC was higher in BA (ED50 = 7.20 +/- 0.16 x 10(-5) M) than middle cerebral arteries (ED50 = 1.25 +/- 0.12 x 10(-4) M). Similar effects of COC were also noted in BA from piglets (ED50 = 0.99 +/- 0.25 x 10(-4) M) and sheep (ED50 = 1.34 +/- 0.31 x 10(-4) M). A variety of amine antagonists, an opiate antagonist and an N-MDA receptor antagonist failed to interfere with the COC-induced contractions. However, haloperidol, indomethacin, verapamil and excess [Mg++]0 (4.8 x 10(-3) M) as well as removal of [Ca++]0 completely prevented vasospasms induced by COC. Dopamine and COC resulted in very similar concentration-response curves on canine BA. COC stimulation failed to affect vascular release of thromboxane B2, prostaglandins or 6-Keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha. Interestingly, 10(-7) M COC rapidly elevated intracellular free Ca++ concentrations of cultured cerebral vascular muscle cells about 50% over initial resting levels. The data suggest that COC produces cerebrovasospasm, probably by a direct action on cerebral blood vessels via promoting Ca++ influx and/or intracellular Ca++ release in cerebral vascular muscle cells, which may be modulated by Mg++.;-;-;-;hard_0

2279;19304800;The zinc fingers of the SR-like protein ZRANB2 are single-stranded RNA-binding domains that recognize 5' splice site-like sequences.;"The alternative splicing of mRNA is a critical process in higher eukaryotes that generates substantial proteomic diversity. Many of the proteins that are essential to this process contain arginine/serine-rich (RS) domains. ZRANB2 is a widely-expressed and highly-conserved RS-domain protein that can regulate alternative splicing but lacks canonical RNA-binding domains. Instead, it contains 2 RanBP2-type zinc finger (ZnF) domains. We demonstrate that these ZnFs recognize ssRNA with high affinity and specificity. Each ZnF binds to a single AGGUAA motif and the 2 domains combine to recognize AGGUAA(N(x))AGGUAA double sites, suggesting that ZRANB2 regulates alternative splicing via a direct interaction with pre-mRNA at sites that resemble the consensus 5' splice site. We show using X-ray crystallography that recognition of an AGGUAA motif by a single ZnF is dominated by side-chain hydrogen bonds to the bases and formation of a guanine-tryptophan-guanine ""ladder."" A number of other human proteins that function in RNA processing also contain RanBP2 ZnFs in which the RNA-binding residues of ZRANB2 are conserved. The ZnFs of ZRANB2 therefore define another class of RNA-binding domain, advancing our understanding of RNA recognition and emphasizing the versatility of ZnF domains in molecular recognition.

2280;30597162;The Biophysical Basis for Phosphorylation-Enhanced DNA-Binding Autoinhibition of the ETS1 Transcription Factor.;The eukaryotic transcription factor ETS1 is regulated by an intrinsically disordered serine-rich region (SRR) that transiently associates with the adjacent ETS domain to inhibit DNA binding. In this study, we further elucidated the physicochemical basis for ETS1 autoinhibition by characterizing the interaction of its ETS domain with a series of synthetic peptides corresponding to the SRR. Binding is driven by the hydrophobic effect and enhanced electrostatically by phosphorylation of serines adjacent to aromatic residues in the amphipathic SRR. Structural characterization of the dynamic peptide/protein complex by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography revealed multiple modes of binding that lead to autoinhibition by synergistically blocking the DNA-binding interface of the ETS domain and stabilizing an appended helical inhibitory module against allosterically induced unfolding. Consistent with these conclusions, the SRR peptide does not interact with DNA-bound ETS1. In addition, we found that the ETS1 SRR phosphopeptide binds to distantly related PU.1 in vitro, indicating that autoinhibition exploits features of the ETS domain that are conserved across this family of transcription factors. ;polyserine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

Micrococcus luteus DNA was just as good a substrate if it was first similarly nick translated with m5dCTP instead of dCTP in the polymerization mixture. At different stages in purification and under various conditions (including in the presence or absence of high mobility group proteins), the methylation of m5C-deficient DNA and that of hemimethylated DNA were compared. Although hemimethylated , m5C-rich DNAs were much better substrates than were m5C-deficient DNAs and normal XP12 DNA could not be methylated, all of these DNAs were bound equally well by the enzyme. In contrast, from the same placental extract, a DNA-binding protein of unknown function was isolated which binds to m5C-rich DNA in preference to the analogous m5C-poor DNA.;polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
2286;9373631;Malaria diagnosis by field workers using an immunochromatographic test.;A rapid immunodiagnostic test (ICT Malaria PfTest) has been developed by ICT Diagnostics (Sydney, Australia) for the diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum infection. The test is an antigen capture assay based on the detection of P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 in peripheral blood. This study was undertaken to assess the performance and usefulness of the test as a diagnostic method in highly malarious, inaccessible forested villages of Mandla district, central India. In all, 353 patients with fever were scanned by the test in parallel with thick blood film examination. The sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 84.5%, respectively. The whole test took about 5 min. The test results became negative in most cases (70%) within 7 d after initiation of curative chemotherapy. The test is simple, easy to learn and accurate, and may prove to be an important tool in the battle against falciparum malaria.;polyhistidine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
2287;7092355;Factors prognostic for survival in patients with malignant melanoma spread to the regional lymph nodes.;To establish clinical and histologic determinants of survival, records of all UCLA patients with resectable melanoma metastatic to the lymph nodes during the years 1954-1976 were reviewed. These 150 patients were treated first with wide excision, lymphadenectomy, and with radiation/chemotherapy and/or additional surgery only if further recurrences developed. None received adjuvant immunotherapy or chemotherapy. In 97 of 139 patients with identified primary tumors, slides of the primary lesion were reviewed. Putative prognostic factors included age, sex, parity, site of primary tumor, presence of satellitosis, clinical status of nodes, histologic characteristics of primary lesion (Clark's level, thickness of tumor, presence/width of ulceration, and number of mitoses/HPF), time from biopsy of primary tumor to lymphadenectomy, and number of positive nodes. kaplan-Meier estimates of survival for the entire group at one, two, five, and ten years were 73, 55, 37, and 33%, respectively. Median follow-up period of survivors was four years. Univariate analyses using the log-rank test showed that thickness of the primary lesion (p less than 0.001), width of ulceration (p = 0.003), absence of ulceration (p = 0.024), and number of positive nodes (p = 0,.033) were prognostic for survival. In multivariate analysis by the Cox procedure, thickness of the primary (p = 0.001) and number of melanoma-containing nodes (p = 0.043) were prognostic for survival. Location of the primary tumor became marginally significant (p = 0.12) in the multrivariate model. These findings demonstrate the prognostic importance of characteristics of both the primary lesion and extent of regional dissemination. Future prospective randomized trials for (adjuvant) therapy of Stage II melanoma should be stratified by these variables.;-;-;-;hard_0
2288;6205269;DNA polymorphisms and subpopulations in Babesia bovis.;Independent isolates of Babesia bovis differ by only a limited number of polypeptides, some of which may be important as host protective antigens. Avirulent derivatives of these parasites also differ from their virulent counterparts in only a few polypeptides. To identify genes encoding such polypeptides we have isolated cDNA clones corresponding to poly(A)+ RNAs that are expressed only in certain isolates. For this purpose a cDNA clone library was constructed from poly(A)+ RNA of the K-avirulent isolate (KA). These clones were screened by colony hybridization using [32P]cDNA complementary to poly(A)+ RNA from KA and from virulent isolates, in order to identify clones that selectively hybridize to one cDNA probe. Hybridization of DNA from three clones, designated pK4, pK5 and pK6 to poly(A)+ RNA from various isolates revealed different and complex patterns. The gene represented by clone pK5 appeared to be transcribed predominantly in avirulent parasites. Analysis of genomic DNA by the Southern procedure enabled each isolate to be distinguished and suggested that most isolates are comprised of a heterogeneous mixture of subpopulations. Analysis of genomic DNA from parasites obtained after passage of KA through the tick vector (Boophilus microplus) suggested that a subpopulation was being selected that more closely resembled KV than KA. ;polyalanine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
2291;9824416;Cloning, expression and characterization of the major latex allergen prohevein.;"BACKGROUND
About 70-80% of latex allergic health care workers are sensitized to prohevein (Hev b 6.01), a 20 kDa cysteine-rich chitin-binding protein of Hevea latex.


OBJECTIVE
This study reports on the bacterial cloning, expression and immunochemical characterization of rHev b 6.01.


METHODS
Prohevein was expressed in the periplasmatic space of Escherichia coli as maltose binding protein (MBP) fusion protein and purified to homogeneity after factor Xa cleavage. The IgE binding capacity of both rHev b 6.01 and prohevein isolated from fresh Hevea latex was compared by immunoblotting experiments using sera of latex-allergic patients. The diagnostic value of rHev b 6.01 was analysed by enzyme allergosorbent test (EAST).


RESULTS
Two different cDNA clones of rHev b 6.01 were established. The deduced amino acid sequence of both clones revealed two and three amino acid differences in the C-terminal domain of prohevein compared with the original database entry. Purified rHev b 6.01 bound with high affinity to chitin as its natural counterpart isolated from natural latex. In IgE-immunblotting using sera of affected subjects binding intensity to both proteins was comparable indicating a very high antigenic similarity. The diagnostic value of MBP-prohevein was tested in EAST using sera of 33 latex-allergic subjects. The in vitro test showed high sensitivity and specificity and proved the diagnostic value of uncleaved MBP-prohevein.


CONCLUSIONS
The production of recombinant latex key allergens with defined quality like prohevein is a straightforward strategy for the development of standardized in vitro test systems.";polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
2292;8386664;Human CD3-CD16+ natural killer cells express the hGATA-3 T cell transcription factor and an unrearranged 2.3-kb TcR delta transcript.;"In this study we analyzed the T cell receptor(TcR) delta transcripts expressed by CD3-CD16+ cells and we investigated whether these cells expressed the hGATA-3 T cell transcription factor and the recombination-activating gene (RAG)-1. Multiple TcR delta transcripts deriving from an unrearranged TcR delta gene were detected in both polyclonal and clonal CD3-CD16+ natural killer(NK) cell lines. Two unrearranged TcR delta transcripts had a size similar to that of the functional TcR delta mRNA (2.3 and 1.3 kb) found in TcR gamma/delta+ T lymphocytes. Sequence analysis of nine different 2.3-kb cDNA clones obtained from NK-derived polyA+ RNA confirmed that they corresponded to an unrearranged TcR delta gene. These cDNA were 2343 bp long and their transcription initiation site was located 814 bp upstream from the J delta 1 segment. The sequence located upstream of the J delta 1 segment corresponded to the previously reported germ-line sequence. The J delta 1 segment was correctly spliced to C delta; in addition the four C delta exons were found to be already assembled. Two polyadenylation sites were present in the fourth C delta exon. However, only that located at the 3' end appeared to be utilized in the 2.3-kb cDNA. The expression of hGATA-3, a T cell-specific factor known to be involved in the regulation of the transcription of TcR delta locus, was analyzed by Northern blot, in cultured NK cell population and clones (but not in freshly derived cell populations). All NK clones and cell lines studied were found to express hGATA-3-specific mRNA, suggesting that hGATA-3 may be involved in the regulation of the unrearranged TcR delta gene expression in NK cells. Finally, no transcription of the RAG-1 gene could be detected in all NK cell lines or clones analyzed. ";polyalanine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

The present approach opens a new way for characterizing transitions in proteins and may lead to a better understanding of their folding mechanism.

Both braided and unbraided catheters were investigated all having the 'headhunter' tip shape. Significant differences between measurements made at 20 and 37 degrees C were found. Torsional stiffness was not a good predictor of performance in the angiographic phantom.

2300;18004999;Depolarization-induced differentiation of PC12 cells is mediated by phospholipase D2 through the transcription factor CREB pathway.;The present study examined the role of phospholipase D2 (PLD2) in the regulation of depolarization-induced neurite outgrowth and the expression of growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43) and synapsin I in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. Depolarization of PC12 cells with 50 mmol/L KCl increased neurite outgrowth and elevated mRNA and protein expression of GAP-43 and synapsin I. These increases were suppressed by inhibition of Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), PLD, or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK). Knockdown of PLD2 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) suppressed the depolarization-induced neurite outgrowth, and the increase in GAP-43 and synapsin I expression. Depolarization evoked a Ca2+ rise that activated various signaling enzymes and the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Silencing CaMKIIdelta by siRNA blocked KCl-induced phosphorylation of proline-rich protein tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2), Src kinase, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Inhibition of Src or MEK abolished phosphorylation of ERK and CREB. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Pyk2, ERK, and CREB was suppressed by the PLD inhibitor, 1-butanol and transfection of PLD2 siRNA, whereas it was enhanced by over-expression of wild-type PLD2. Depolarization-induced PLD2 activation was suppressed by CaMKII and Src inhibitors, but not by MEK or protein kinase A inhibitors. These results suggest that the signaling pathway of depolarization-induced PLD2 activation was downstream of CaMKIIdelta and Src, and upstream of Pyk2(Y881) and ERK/CREB, but independent of the protein kinase A. This is the first demonstration that PLD2 activation is involved in GAP-43 and synapsin I expression during depolarization-induced neuronal differentiation in PC12 cells. ;polyproline;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
2301;2831201;Three distinct forms of type 2A protein phosphatase in human erythrocyte cytosol.;Two type 2A protein phosphatases, phosphatases I (Mr = 180,000) and III (Mr = 177,000), were purified to near homogeneity from human erythrocyte cytosol. Phosphatase I was composed of alpha (34 kDa), beta (63 kDa), and delta (74 kDa) subunits in a ratio of 1:1:1. Phosphatase III comprised alpha, beta, and gamma (53 kDa) subunits in the same ratio. Heparin-Sepharose column chromatography converted most of phosphatase I and 20% of phosphatase III into alpha 1 beta 1 which were indistinguishable from phosphatase IV (Usui, H., Kinohara, N., Yoshikawa, K., Imazu, M., Imaoka, T., and Takeda, M. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 10455-10463). The catalytic subunit alpha and the beta subunit of phosphatases I, III, and IV displayed identical V8 and papain peptide maps, respectively, while the peptide maps of the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta subunits were clearly distinct. The molar ratio of phosphatases I, III, and IV in erythrocyte cytosol was estimated to be 6:1:14. Comparison of molecular activities of alpha, alpha 1 beta 1, alpha 1 beta 1 delta 1, and alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 1 revealed that beta suppressed phosphorylase and P-H2B histone phosphatase activities of alpha but stimulated the P-H1 histone phosphatase activity, and delta suppressed all the phosphatase activities of alpha 1 beta 1. The gamma subunit stimulated the P-histone phosphatase activity of alpha 1 beta 1 but inhibited the phosphorylase and P-spectrin phosphatase activities. The beta subunit increased the Mg2+ or Mn2+ requirement for P-H2B histone phosphatase activity of alpha, an effect which was counteracted by delta. The effects of heparin, H1 histone, protamine, and polylysine on the phosphorylase phosphatase activity of phosphatases I, III, IV, and alpha were described and discussed in connection with the functions of the subunits.;polylysine;phosphatase activity;-;LCR_with_function

2303;1827591;Lipoprotein(a) impairs generation of plasmin by fibrin-bound tissue-type plasminogen activator. In vitro studies in a plasma milieu.;"Apoprotein(a), (apo[a]), the specific antigen of lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]), consists of structural domains (a serine protease unit, kringles 4 and 5) with marked homology to those of the corresponding domains in plasminogen. In this study, we have investigated the impact of this unique structural mimicry on the binding and activation of plasminogen by fibrin-bound tissue-type plasminogen activator at the plasma-fibrin interface. We found that the total amount of plasmin generated on the surface of fibrin was decreased in the presence of high concentrations of Lp(a): 197 +/- 65 fmol in plasmas with greater than 60 mg/dl Lp(a) versus 287 +/- 112 fmol in control plasmas. A similar effect was also apparent in the corresponding euglobulin fractions (554 +/- 169 fmol versus 754 +/- 310 fmol), the latter lacking the plasminogen-binding proteins alpha 2-antiplasmin and histidine-rich glycoprotein, but containing Lp(a). The difference between plasma samples was significant (p less than 0.05) as calculated from the percent decrease in plasmin generated from plasmas with high levels of Lp(a) relative to that generated in the paired controls with low Lp(a) levels. The involvement of Lp(a) was verified in a reconstituted system consisting of normal human plasma supplemented with 100 mg/dl of either purified Lp(a) or low density lipoprotein. Lp(a) produced a decrease of 30% in the generation of plasmin (180 fmol versus 255 fmol in plasma, and 485 fmol versus 705 fmol in the euglobulin fraction). Moreover, using a radiolabeled sheep antibody against human apo(a), we were able to demonstrate the binding of 40 fmol Lp(a) to fibrin during ongoing plasminogen activation. These results indicate that Lp(a) impairs the binding of plasminogen to fibrin and thereby decreases the generation of plasmin by occupying C-terminal lysine residues unveiled on the fibrin surface by plasmin degradation as recently reported (Circulation 1990;82[suppl III]:III-92). In consequence, impairment of fibrinolysis and accumulation of Lp(a) at sites of vascular injury may occur, factors that may be important in the development of atherosclerosis and associated thrombosis.";polyhistidine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
2308;1655782;Insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 binding specificity is determined by distinct regions of their cognate receptors.;Chimeric insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 receptors and insulin receptor alpha-subunit point mutants were characterized with respect to their binding properties for insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and their ability to translate ligand interaction into tyrosine kinase activation in intact cells. We found that replacement of the amino-terminal 137 amino acids of the insulin receptor (IR) with the corresponding 131 amino acids of the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) resulted in loss of affinity for both ligands. Further replacement of the adjacent cysteine region with IGF-1R sequences fully reconstituted affinity for IGF-1, but only marginally for insulin. Unexpectedly, replacement of the IR cysteine-rich domain alone by IGF-1R sequences created a high affinity receptor for both insulin and IGF-1. The binding characteristics of all receptor chimeras reflected the potential of both ligands to regulate the receptor tyrosine kinase activity in intact cells. Our chimeric receptor data, in conjunction with IR amino-terminal domain point mutants, strongly suggest major contributions of structural determinants in both amino- and carboxyl-terminal IR alpha-subunit regions for the formation of the insulin-binding pocket, whereas, surprisingly, the residues defining IGF-1 binding are present predominantly in the cysteine-rich domain of the IGF-1R.;polycysteine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
2315;12672449;Are Huntington's and polyglutamine-based ataxias proteasome storage diseases?;"To date, 10 neurological diseases, including Huntington's and several ataxias, are caused by a lengthening of glutamine (Q) tracts in various proteins. Even though the Q expansions arise in unrelated proteins, the diseases share three striking features: (1) 35 contiguous glutamines constitutes the pathological threshold for 9 of the 10 diseases; (2) the Q-expanded proteins are expressed in many tissues, yet pathology is largely restricted to neurons; and (3) the Q-expanded proteins or fragments thereof form nuclear inclusions that also contain ubiquitin, proteasomes and chaperones. Our studies of the proteasome activator REGgamma suggest a possible explanation for these shared properties. REGgamma is highly expressed in brain, located in the nucleus and actually suppresses the proteasome active sites principally responsible for cleaving glutamine-MCA bonds. These observations coupled with reports that peptides longer than 35 residues, the polyQ pathology threshold, are unable to diffuse out of the proteasome suggest the following hypothesis. Proteins containing long glutamine tracts are efficiently pumped into REGgamma-capped 26S proteasomes, but REGgamma suppression of cleavage after glutamine produces polyQ fragments too long to diffuse out of the 20S proteolytic core thereby inactivating the 26S proteasome. In effect, we hypothesize that the polyQ pathologies may be proteasomal storage diseases analogous to disorders of lysosome catabolism. ";polyglutamine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

OSR1 and SPAK are key regulators of NKCCs (Na(+)/K(+)/2Cl(-) cotransporters) and activated by WNK family members (with-no-lysine kinase), mutations of which are known to cause Gordon syndrome, an autosomal dominant form of inherited hypertension. The crystal structure of OSR1 kinase domain has been solved at 2.25 A. OSR1 forms a domain-swapped dimer in an inactive conformation, in which P+1 loop and alphaEF helix are swapped between dimer-related monomers. Structural alignment with nonswapped Ste20 TAO2 kinase indicates that the integrity of chemical interactions in the kinase domain is well preserved in the domain-swapped interfaces. The OSR1 kinase domain has now been added to a growing list of domain-swapped protein kinases recently reported, suggesting that the domain-swapping event provides an additional layer of complexity in regulating protein kinase activity. ;polyalanine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
2331;8941498;Clinical management of asthma in the 1990s. Current therapy and new directions.;Asthma is a serious global health problem affecting nearly 100 million people worldwide.

Traditionally, symptomatic control of bronchoconstriction with beta 2 agonists and theophylline has been the mainstay of therapy. However, during recent years, inflammation has been recognised as the predominant cause of reversible airway obstruction and airway hyperreactivity. As a result, the emphasis in treatment has shifted to the early use of inhaled corticosteroids to control airway inflammation. beta 2 agonists are best used on an as-needed basis for the relief of acute bronchoconstriction and for the prevention of exercise-induced asthma. Sustained release theophylline or an inhaled long-acting beta 2 agonist may effectively control nocturnal symptoms.

One of the clones identified by its expression of antigenic determinants of the yeast enzyme is shown to contain the coding sequence of the enzyme: no active DNA topoisomerase I is detectable in cell extracts when insertion or deletion mutations are introduced into a 2-kilobase-pair (kb) region of the sequence in a haploid yeast genome. Blot hybridizations show that there is a single copy of the cloned sequence per haploid and that the sequence is transcribed to give a 2.7-kb poly(A)+ message. Mutants in which 1.7 kb of the sequence is deleted are viable. Temperature-shift experiments using synchronously grown cells of a delta top1 top2 temperature-sensitive (ts) double mutant and its isogenic top2 ts strain show that, whereas mitotic blocks can prevent killing of the top2 ts mutant at a nonpermissive temperature, the same treatments are ineffective in preventing cell death of the delta top1 top2 ts double mutant. These experiments suggest that in yeast DNA topoisomerase I serves a role auxiliary to DNA topoisomerase II. ;polyalanine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

In this retrospective case series study 77 patients (53% female, with mean ± standard deviation [SD] of 82.6±9.3 years) with 97 eyes (45 OS [left eyes]/52 OD [right eyes]) were included. This was a retrospective review of the charts of patients who presented with exudative AMD at the Pitié Salpetrière Hospital, Paris, France, between December 2016 and August 2017 that received intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapies. At baseline, following biomicroscopy examination, multimodal imaging was performed including, fluorescein angiography (FA), fundus auto-fluorescence (FAF), spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA). During the follow-up, SD-OCT with/without FAF and FA were performed for each patient at 6, 12 and 18 months. For investigation of the prevalence of GA in eyes undergoing intravitreal injections with anti-VEGF therapy, FAF and SD-OCT images were qualitatively reviewed by four independent observers (two graders per group). Kappa coefficient of Cohen was calculated to determine agreement between the graders. The kappa coefficient of Cohen, for inter-rater agreement in the evaluation of FAF images was 0.468, indicating a moderate agreement between the first and second raters. Thus, the sensitivity and specificity of FAF for the diagnosis of GA were 70% and 57%, respectively. If atrophy was assessed with SD-OCT image analysis, the kappa coefficient for inter-rater agreement was 0.846, implying an acceptable agreement between both readers. The sensitivity and specificity of SD-OCT were 93% and 58% respectively.

The p57 gene contains three GC-rich introns of 166 bp, 566 bp, and 83 bp, and two of the four exons correspond to coding regions. Alternative splicing generates the heterogeneity in the translational initiations.

2345;8278363;A glutamine-rich hydrophobic patch in transcription factor Sp1 contacts the dTAFII110 component of the Drosophila TFIID complex and mediates transcriptional activation.;Activation of transcription by the promoter-specific factor Sp1 requires coactivators that are tightly associated with the TATA-box-binding protein (TBP) in the TFIID complex. Recent work has shown that the two glutamine-rich activation domains of Sp1, A and B, can interact with at least one component of this complex, the TBP-associated factor dTAFII110. Here we report the mapping of a region of Sp1 with alternating glutamine and hydrophobic residues which is required for the interaction with dTAFII110 and is important for mediating transcriptional activation. Substitution of bulky hydrophobic residues within this region decreased both interaction with dTAFII110 and transcriptional activation in Drosophila cells. In contrast, mutation of glutamine residues in this region had no effect. Thus, the strength of the Sp1-TAF interaction correlates with the potency of Sp1 as a transcriptional activator, indicating that this activator-TAF interaction is an important part of the mechanism of transcriptional activation. Sequence comparison of three activation domains shown to bind dTAFII110 suggests that different activators that utilize dTAFII110 as a coactivator may share common sequence features that we have determined to be important for the Sp1-dTAFII110 interaction.;polyglutamine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

2347;7788499;LIM domain proteins.;The LIM domain is a cysteine-rich domain composed of 2 special zinc fingers that are joined by a 2-amino acid spacer. Some proteins are constituted by LIM domains only while others contain a variety of different functional domains. LIM proteins form a diverse group which includes transcription factors and cytoskeletal proteins. The primary role of LIM domains appears to be in protein-protein interaction, through the formation of dimers with identical or different LIM domains or by binding distinct proteins. In LIM homeodomain proteins, LIM domains seem to function as negative regulatory domains. LIM homeodomain proteins are involved in the control of cell lineage determination and the regulation of differentiation, and LIM-only proteins may have similar roles. LIM-only proteins are also implicated in the control of cell proliferation since several genes encoding such proteins are associated with oncogenic chromosome translocations. In analyzing sequence relationships between LIM domains we suggest that they may be arranged into 5 groups which appear to correlate with the structural and functional properties of the proteins containing these domains. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
2350;8876223;Transcription factor EGR-1 suppresses the growth and transformation of human HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells by induction of transforming growth factor beta 1.;The early growth response 1 (EGR-1) gene product is a transcription factor with role in differentiation and growth. We have previously shown that expression of exogenous EGR-1 in various human tumor cells unexpectedly and markedly reduces growth and tumorigenicity and, conversely, that suppression of endogenous Egr-1 expression by antisense RNA eliminates protein expression, enhances growth, and promotes phenotypic transformation. However, the mechanism of these effects remained unknown. The promoter of human transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) contains two GC-rich EGR-1 binding sites. We show that expression of EGR-1 in human HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells uses increased secretion of biologically active TGF-beta 1 in direct proportion (rPearson = 0.96) to the amount of EGR-1 expressed and addition of recombinant human TGF-beta 1 is strongly growth-suppressive for these cells. Addition of monoclonal anti-TGF-beta 1 antibodies to EGR-1-expressing HT-1080 cells completely reverses the growth inhibitory effects of EGR-1. Reporter constructs bearing the EGR-1 binding segment of the TGF-beta 1 promoter was activated 4- to 6-fold relative to a control reporter in either HT-1080 cells that stably expressed or parental cells cotransfected with an EGR-1 expression vector. Expression of delta EGR-1, a mutant that cannot interact with the corepressors, nerve growth factor-activated factor binding proteins NAB1 and NAB2, due to deletion of the repressor domain, exhibited enhanced transactivation of 2- to 3.5-fold over that of wild-type EGR-1 showing that the reporter construct reflected the appropriate in vivo regulatory context. The EGR-1-stimulated transactivation was inhibited by expression of the Wilms tumor suppressor, a known specific DNA-binding competitor. These results indicate that EGR-1 suppresses growth of human HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells by induction of TGF-beta 1.;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
2353;7083928;A screening test for airways reactivity. An abbreviated methacholine inhalation challenge.;A screening test to measure nonspecific airways reactivity was developed and compared to a standard methacholine inhalation challenge in 13 asthmatic patients and ten normal control subjects. The screening challenge consisted of one deep breath, then four breaths of a 5 mg/ml methacholine solution followed by one and four breaths of 25 mg/ml of methacholine. Subjects with a history of wheezing received the 5 mg/ml of methacholine first while those without a history of asthma began the challenge at the 25 mg/ml methacholine concentration. Spirometric test were employed and the challenge was terminated when FEV1 fell 20 percent from baseline. The standard methacholine challenge used a dosimeter and all subjects took five breaths of saline solution followed by seven increasing concentrations of methacholine. Dose response curves were constructed and the provocation dose of methacholine that caused a 20 percent fall in FEV1 was calculated for each protocol. Results of the screening methacholine challenge correlated with those obtained from the more lengthy standard protocol (r = 0.94), and correctly identified levels of airways reactivity in asthmatic patients and normal subjects. The abbreviated protocol was rapid (6-12 min), safe, and inexpensive. Since the equipment is readily available and easy to transport, it could be used at sites outside the hospital as a screening test for nonspecific airways reactivity.;-;-;-;hard_0
2355;9515041;Interaction of hypoxia and aging in the heart: analysis of high energy phosphate content.;"To test the hypotheses that aged myocardium has lower ATP concentration and that a greater ATP hydrolysis during hypoxia exaggerates diastolic dysfunction in aged myocardium, we used 31P NMR spectroscopy to measure ATP and phosphocreatine (PCr) contents combined with heart function at baseline and during hypoxia and reoxygenation in perfused hearts isolated from young adult (3-4 months old) and old (24-25 months old) Fisher 344 rats. At baseline, old hearts had 30% lower heart rate and prevalent supraventricular arrhythmia; they had lower PCr and creatine contents (approximately 30%) but normal ATP content. Hypoxia caused similar decreases in heart rate and rate pressure product in young and old hearts. There was a two-fold increase in left-ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) in young adults, but, surprisingly, no change in LVEDP in old hearts. ATP decreased similarly in hearts from young and old rats, but the PCr decrease was two-fold smaller in old hearts during hypoxia. Superimposition of pacing on hypoxic old hearts caused six-fold increase in LVEDP; although utilization of PCr increased, it was still incomplete. We conclude that PCr is incompletely used to maintain ATP level during hypoxia especially in the senescent heart, and that the increase in LVEDP in old hearts cannot be explained solely by changes in indices of bioenergetics.";-;-;-;hard_0

From each of the two formulas two different dilutions were prepared so that all diets supplied about 100 kcal/kg/day, but, respectively, 2.0 and 4.0 g/kg/day of cow milk protein and 2.0 and 5.0 g/kg/day of soy protein. After 4.5 months, growth in weight, length, and head circumference was normal and very similar in all infants. Gammaglobulin, immunoglobulin, transferrin, and some complement fractions (particularly C'3, C'1 INA, C'3 PA) were lower in infants receiving soy protein diets than in those receiving cow milk protein diets, and, within each type of diet, in those infants receiving lower amounts of protein. In particular, values of infants receiving 5.0 g/kg/day of soy protein were roughly comparable to those of infants receiving 2.0 g/kg/day of cow milk protein. B lymphocyte markers and reactivity did not show significant differences among the various groups. T lymphocyte markers and reactivity showed an impairment in soy protein diets (and in particular in 2.0 g/kg/day protein diets) with respect to cow milk diets.

2365;10713453;The protein Hrb57A of Drosophila melanogaster closely related to hnRNP K from vertebrates is present at sites active in transcription and coprecipitates with four RNA-binding proteins.;The hnRNP K protein is among the major hnRNA-binding proteins with a strong preference for cytidine-rich sequences. We have cloned a Drosophila hnRNP protein closely related to this vertebrate protein. The protein first identified by the monoclonal antibody Q18 is encoded by a gene located in 57A on polytene chromosomes and has been consequently named Hrb57A. The amino acid sequence of the Hrb57A KH domains and their overall organisation in the protein are remarkably similar to the vertebrate proteins. As the hnRNP K in vertebrates the M(r) 55 000 Drosophila Hrb57A/Q18 protein strongly binds to poly(C) in vitro and is ubiquitously present in nuclei active in transcription. On polytene chromosomes it is found in many puffs and minipuffs. Hrb57A/Q18 specifically coprecipitates four other proteins: Hrb87F/P11 a Drosophila hnRNP A1 homologue, the hnRNA-binding protein S5, the RNA recognition motif-containing protein NonA and the RNA-binding zinc finger-containing protein on ecdysone puffs PEP/X4. ;polycysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
2368;8264613;In vitro selection of DNA elements highly responsive to the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I transcriptional activator, Tax.;The human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) transactivator, Tax, the ubiquitous transcriptional factor cyclic AMP (cAMP) response element-binding protein (CREB protein), and the 21-bp repeats in the HTLV-I transcriptional enhancer form a ternary nucleoprotein complex (L. J. Zhao and C. Z. Giam, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:7070-7074, 1992). Using an antibody directed against the COOH-terminal region of Tax along with purified Tax and CREB proteins, we selected DNA elements bound specifically by the Tax-CREB complex in vitro. Two distinct but related groups of sequences containing the cAMP response element (CRE) flanked by long runs of G and C residues in the 5' and 3' regions, respectively, were preferentially recognized by Tax-CREB. In contrast, CREB alone binds only to CRE motifs (GNTGACG[T/C]) without neighboring G- or C-rich sequences. The Tax-CREB-selected sequences bear a striking resemblance to the 5' or 3' two-thirds of the HTLV-I 21-bp repeats and are highly inducible by Tax. Gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays, DNA transfection, and DNase I footprinting analyses indicated that the G- and C-rich sequences flanking the CRE motif are crucial for Tax-CREB-DNA ternary complex assembly and Tax transactivation but are not in direct contact with the Tax-CREB complex. These data show that Tax recruits CREB to form a multiprotein complex that specifically recognizes the viral 21-bp repeats. The expanded DNA binding specificity of Tax-CREB and the obligatory role the ternary Tax-CREB-DNA complex plays in transactivation reveal a novel mechanism for regulating the transcriptional activity of leucine zipper proteins like CREB.;polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
2370;19825485;Delayed arousal.;Elderly patients have medical and psychological problems affecting all major organ systems. These problems may alter the pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics of medications, or expose previous neurologic deficits simply as a result of sedation. Delayed arousal, therefore, may arise from structural problems that are pre-existent or new, or metabolic or functional disorders such as convulsive or nonconvulsive seizures. Determining the cause of delayed arousal may require clinical, chemical, and structural tests. Structural problems that impair consciousness arise from a small number of focal lesions to specific areas of the central nervous system, or from pathology affecting the cerebrum. In general, focal or multifocal lesions can be identified by computerized tomography, or diffusion-weighted imaging.

2378;2115670;Characterization of a human cDNA encoding a widely expressed and highly conserved cysteine-rich protein with an unusual zinc-finger motif.;A human term placental cDNA library was screened at low stringency with a human prolactin cDNA probe. One of the cDNAs isolated hybridizes to a 1.8 kb mRNA present in all four tissues of the placenta as well as to every nucleated tissue and cell line tested. The sequence of the full-length cDNA was determined. An extended open reading frame predicted an encoded protein product of 20.5 kDa. This was directly confirmed by the in vitro translation of a synthetic mRNA transcript. Based upon the characteristic placement of cysteine (C) and histidine (H) residues in the predicted protein structure, this molecule contains four putative zinc fingers. The first and third fingers are of the C4 class while the second and fourth are of the C2HC class. Based upon sequence similarities between the first two and last two zinc fingers and sequence similarities to a related rodent protein, cysteine-rich intestinal protein (CRIP), these four finger domains appear to have evolved by duplication of a preexisting two finger unit. Southern blot analyses indicate that this human cysteine-rich protein (hCRP) gene has been highly conserved over the span of evolution from yeast to man.

Study subjects were 13 women with uncomplicated IDDM treated with a monophasic combination of 30 micrograms ethinyl estradiol and 75 micrograms gestodene for 12 consecutive cycles and 13 women of comparable diabetic status as control. During the study period, none of the participants developed increased renal albumin excretion, which was used as a direct measure of endothelial function. In the indirect assessment of endothelial function, we found a proportionate increase in plasma levels of thrombin-antithrombin III (TAT) complexes and D-dimer during treatment. Hormonal intake was followed by decreased antigen concentrations of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor (type 1 [PAI-1]), whereas the activities of t-PA and PAI-1 were unchanged. Plasma levels of plasminogen and histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) increased and decreased, respectively, whereas an increase in von Willebrand factor was observed in the treatment group. No significant changes in direct or indirect measures were observed in the control group during the observation period of 12 months. In conclusion, no adverse effect on endothelial function was demonstrated by direct measures, but our findings suggest that a procoagulant state, compensated by enhanced activity of the fibrinolytic system, is induced by hormonal treatment.

2392;35444028;Cell-Penetrating Peptide TAT-HuR-HNS3 Suppresses Proinflammatory Gene Expression via Competitively Blocking Interaction of HuR with Its Partners.;Proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines are commonly regulated by RNA-binding proteins at posttranscriptional levels. Human Ag R (HuR)/embryonic lethal abnormal vision-like 1 (ELAVL1) is one of the well-characterized RNA-binding proteins that increases the stability of short-lived mRNAs, which encode proinflammatory mediators. HuR employs its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling sequence (HNS) domain, interacting with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), which accounts for the enhanced poly-ADP-ribosylation and cytoplasmic shuttling of HuR. Also by using its HNS domain, HuR undergoes dimerization/oligomerization, underlying the increased binding of HuR with proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine mRNAs and the disassociation of the miRNA-induced silencing complex from the targets. Therefore, competitively blocking the interactions of HuR with its partners may suppress proinflammatory mediator production. In this study, peptides derived from the sequence of the HuR-HNS domain were synthesized, and their effects on interfering HuR interacting with PARP1 and HuR itself were analyzed. Moreover, cell-penetrating TAT-HuR-HNS3 was delivered into human and mouse cells or administered into mouse lungs with or without exposure of TNF-α or LPS. mRNA levels of proinflammatory mediators as well as neutrophil infiltration were evaluated. We showed that TAT-HuR-HNS3 interrupts HuR-PARP1 interaction and therefore results in a lowered poly-ADP-ribosylation level and decreased cytoplasmic distribution of HuR. TAT-HuR-HNS3 also blocks HuR dimerization and promotes Argonaute 2-based miRNA-induced silencing complex binding to the targets. Moreover, TAT-HuR-HNS3 lowers mRNA stability of proinﬂammatory mediators in TNF-α-treated epithelial cells and macrophages, and it decreases TNF-α-induced inflammatory responses in lungs of experimental animals. Thus, TAT-HuR-HNS3 is a promising lead peptide for the development of inhibitors to treat inﬂammation-related diseases.;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
2394;7854015;Reactions of diazomethane with glycerolipids in the presence of serum or inorganic salts.;"Diazomethane is widely used for the selective methylation of nonesterified fatty acids in the presence of other lipids. However, when the reaction is carried out directly with plasma or serum, substantial methanolysis of phospholipid acyl groups occurs. Because of the importance of rigorous selectivity in the assay of unesterified fatty acids which are present only in trace amounts in cells and body fluids, we have investigated the diazomethane procedure in detail and reached the following conclusions: (i) When diazomethane reacts with lipid extracts in organic solvent, no ester hydrolysis occurs. (ii) In the presence of serum or plasma, diazomethane reacts with water and inorganic salts, causing the solution to become basic (CH2N2 + NaCl + HOH-->Ch3Cl + Na+ + OH- + N2); methoxide ions are formed from methanol (CH3OH + OH(-)-->CH3O- + HOH) causing extensive methanolysis (CH3O- + RO-CO-R'-->CH3O-CO-R' + RO-). An analogous reaction takes place with ethanol. All esters of glycerol are transesterified in aqueous salt solution by this mechanism. It is therefore essential to prepare a lipid extract prior to the assay of unesterified fatty acids when using the diazomethane procedure.";-;-;-;hard_0
2395;2522449;Primary structure of a human small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide as deduced by cDNA analysis.;Anti-Sm is an antibody specificity often associated with the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus. The polypeptides Sm-B'/B (estimated molecular mass 27 and 26 kDa, respectively) are primary targets of Sm antibodies. Sm-B'/B are part of the core polypeptides of small ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNP) involved in pre-mRNA splicing. Sm-B'/B share the same amino-terminal sequence as we determined by microsequence analyses of the purified polypeptides. Oligonucleotide probes based on that sequence were used to isolate seven clones from a human lymphoblastoid cDNA library in lambda gt10. The clones contained a single coding region for a protein of approximately 25 kDa. The predicted amino-terminal sequence was identical to that of the isolated Sm-B'/B polypeptides. In vitro translation experiments produced a protein immunoreactive with human polyclonal anti-Sm antibodies. The isolation of only one unique cDNA sequence suggests that Sm-B'/B may be post-translational variants encoded by a single message. The specific structural features which distinguish Sm-B' from Sm-B have yet to be determined. Northern blot analysis confirmed the diverse tissue and species distribution expected for these immunologically conserved polypeptides. The Sm-B'/B primary sequence is rich in proline (20%) and glycine (15%) residues. The prolines are concentrated in the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein and display a repetitive unit that is shared with other snRNP and nucleic acid binding proteins.

In this study, the IRF3 cDNA of sea perch Lateolabrax maculatus (SpIRF3) was identified, which contained 1781 bp with an open reading frame of 1398 bp that coded a 465 amino acid protein. The SpIRF3 protein shared conserved characterizations with its homologues and displayed the conserved DNA-binding domain, IRF association domain, serine-rich C-terminal domain, and tryptophan residue cluster. Phylogenetic analysis illustrated that SpIRF3 belonged to the IRF3 subfamily. Subcellular localization analysis showed that SpIRF3 mainly resided in the cytoplasm without stimuli but translocated into nuclei in the presence of poly I:C. Real-time PCR data indicated that SpIRF3 was transcriptionally up-regulated by poly I:C stimulation in various organs. Moreover, reporter assay revealed that SpIRF3 functioned as a modulator in triggering the IFN response by inducing the activity of IFN and ISRE-containing promoter. These data revealed that SpIRF3 was a potential molecule in the IFN immune defense system against viral infection. ;polyserine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

We then evaluated the potential of protamine-coatings to assist the induction of immune responses in mice. Interestingly, enhanced antibodies and T-cell responses were observed in mice treated with the coated particles. In vitro studies suggested that the improved immunological performance was mediated by an increased uptake. Indeed, protamine-coated particles that carried a plasmid were even internalised into non-phagocytic cells and to cause their transfection.

2408;9390192;Maintenance of transfection rates and physical characterization of lipid/DNA complexes after freeze-drying and rehydration.;"It is well established that cationic liposomes form complexes with DNA and effectively transfect cells in vivo and ex vivo. Lipid/DNA complexes have proven safe and nonimmunogenic in clinical trials; however, they are known to aggregate readily in liquid formulations. This physical instability requires clinicians to prepare lipid/DNA complexes immediately prior to injection. In order to eliminate problems associated with this temporal requirement, we investigated the feasibility of preserving complexes as a dried preparation that could be tested, stored, and rehydrated as needed. To this end, our study evaluated the ability of different stabilizers to preserve transfection rates of complexes during acute freeze-drying stress. Our data show that complexes lyophilized in 0.5 M sucrose or trehalose possessed transfection rates similar to those of fresh preparations. In addition, dried complexes that exhibited full transfection activity upon rehydration had sizes comparable to nonlyophilized controls. Our work demonstrates that lipid/DNA complexes can be stabilized as dried powders that offer significant advantages over current liquid formulations. Furthermore, the correlation of transfection rates with maintenance of complex diameter suggests that size plays a critical role in lipid-based DNA delivery.";-;-;-;hard_0
2413;22977237;Structure of the bone morphogenetic protein receptor ALK2 and implications for fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva.;Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor kinases are tightly regulated to control development and tissue homeostasis. Mutant receptor kinase domains escape regulation leading to severely degenerative diseases and represent an important therapeutic target. Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare but devastating disorder of extraskeletal bone formation. FOP-associated mutations in the BMP receptor ALK2 reduce binding of the inhibitor FKBP12 and promote leaky signaling in the absence of ligand. To establish structural mechanisms of receptor regulation and to address the effects of FOP mutation, we determined the crystal structure of the cytoplasmic domain of ALK2 in complex with the inhibitors FKBP12 and dorsomorphin. FOP mutations break critical interactions that stabilize the inactive state of the kinase, thereby facilitating structural rearrangements that diminish FKBP12 binding and promote the correct positioning of the glycine-serine-rich loop and αC helix for kinase activation. The balance of these effects accounts for the comparable activity of R206H and L196P. Kinase activation in the clinically benign mutant L196P is far weaker than R206H but yields equivalent signals due to the stronger interaction of FKBP12 with R206H. The presented ALK2 structure offers a valuable template for the further design of specific inhibitors of BMP signaling. ;polyserine;helix;-;LCR_with_function

We report here the characterization of this heat-labile, macromolecular factor and that the presence of helper is absolutely required for light- and rhodopsin-dependent activation of photoreceptor GTPase. Of equal importance, we find that the ""G"" component (which requires the presence of H for expression of GTPase activity) can bind GTP and can support light- and GTP-dependent PDEase activation in the absence of H component. These data support a model in which GTP binding to G component is a necessary condition for PDEase activation. Hydrolysis of GTP at the G activator locus (an H-dependent activity) is a regulatory event which reverses PDEase activation. The complexity of this regulatory mechanism provides opportunities for signal modulation and amplification.";-;-;-;hard_0
2418;32581673;The Mechanisms of Nuclear Proteotoxicity in Polyglutamine Spinocerebellar Ataxias.;Polyglutamine (polyQ) spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are the most prevalent subset of SCAs and share the aberrant expansion of Q-encoding CAG repeats within the coding sequences of disease-responsible genes as their common genetic cause. These polyQ SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, and SCA17) are inherited neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the progressive atrophy of the cerebellum and connected regions of the nervous system, which leads to loss of fine muscle movement coordination. Upon the expansion of polyQ repeats, the mutated proteins typically accumulate disproportionately in the neuronal nucleus, where they sequester various target molecules, including transcription factors and other nuclear proteins. However, it is not yet clearly understood how CAG repeat expansion takes place or how expanded polyQ proteins accumulate in the nucleus. In this article, we review the current knowledge on the molecular and cellular bases of nuclear proteotoxicity of polyQ proteins in SCAs and present our perspectives on the remaining issues surrounding these diseases.;polyglutamine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

The presence of variant trophozoites can be detected in clones after exposure to cytotoxic monoclonal antibodies. Surviving Giardia (progeny) no longer possess the initial major surface antigen which is replaced by new antigens. Exposure of a clone from one progeny to another cytotoxic mAb specific to one newly appearing surface antigen resulted in the loss of this antigen and replacement by another set of antigens. The frequency of change was rapid (1:100-1:1000) and was dependent upon the isolate. The presence of variant populations in clones was confirmed by direct and indirect immunofluorescence using mAbs to major surface antigens of subsequent progeny. The putative amino acid sequence of a portion of one antigen revealed a cysteine-rich composition which was confirmed in this variant protein as well as others by preferential uptake of [35S]cysteine. The mechanism(s) responsible most likely involves genomic rearrangements since Southern blots revealed a family of related genes which changed frequently compared to other areas of the genome. However, expression-linked copies have not been detected. Loss and gain of surface antigens have also been found in gerbils and humans infected with defined clones, but there does not appear to be cyclical appearance of variant populations.

2426;8025119;Effects of substitution of proposed Zn(II) ligand His81 or His64 in phage T4 gene 32 protein: spectroscopic evidence for a novel zinc coordination complex.;T4 gene 32 protein (gp32), the prototype helix-destabilizing or single-stranded (ss) DNA binding protein, contains one tightly coordinated Zn2+ ion bound tetrahedrally by three cysteines (residues 77, 87, and 90) and a fourth non-thiol donor. In previous work, it was shown that the proposed non-thiol ligand His81 could be readily substituted with nonliganding glutamine and alanine residues without deleterious effects on gp32 structure and simple assays of ssDNA binding. In this paper we show that exchange broadening of bulk 35Cl- anion by protein-bound Zn(II) is not observed in the His81-->Ala (H81A) mutant, unless the coordination site is disrupted with an organomercurial, p-mercuriphenylsulfonate. This suggests that, in the mutant protein, anions, and by implication solvent molecules, do not gain access to a newly formed inner shell Zn(II) coordination site as a result of mutagenesis. H81A gp32 is characterized by nearly wild-type helix-destabilizing activity on poly(d[A-T]) and highly cooperative binding to the polynucleotide poly(A) at pH 7.7 over the temperature range from 20 to 42 degrees C at 0.35 M NaCl, exhibiting only a approximately 2.5-4-fold decrease in poly(A) affinity. Limited proteolysis experiments show that an additional tryptic cleavage site maps to the Arg111-Lys112 bond within the protease-resistant core domain of the H81A gp32 following long incubation times and results in the accumulation of a 16-kDa subcore fragment. This new cleavage site is within the internal LAST motif, which has been proposed to be directly involved in cooperative ssDNA binding [Casas-Finet, J. R., & Karpel, R. L. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 9735-9744]. Thus substitution of His81 with Ala subtly alters the conformation or dynamics of the backbone around the LAST motif, which may be manifest as a moderately lower cooperative binding affinity of H81A gp32 for polynucleotides. H81A gp32, however, is fully functional in stimulating in vitro homologous pairing catalyzed by the T4 recombinase uvsX protein. Since substitution of His81 with a nonliganding Ala is nearly silent, we propose an alternative mode of Zn(II) coordination in T4 gene 32 protein, involving His64 rather than His81 as the fourth non-thiol ligand. That replacement of His64, and not His81, with Cys results in marked changes in the first coordination sphere of ligands as evidenced by the optical spectrum of Co(II)-substituted H64C gp32 is consistent with the noninvolvement of His81 and implicates a novel His64-X12-Cys77-X9-Cys87-X2-Cys90 coordination motif, unique among zinc-containing nucleic acid binding proteins. ;polyalanine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
2428;3986911;N4 virion RNA polymerase sites of transcription initiation.;Coliphage N4 virion encapsulated RNA polymerase shows a marked preference for denatured N4 DNA as a template. We show that initiation on denatured N4 virion DNA occurs with in vivo specificity. The location of the in vivo and in vitro initiation sites and the corresponding DNA sequences were determined. The N4 virion RNA polymerase promoters contain extensive sequence homology from position -18 to position 1, with a conserved GC-rich heptamer centered at -12, and two sets of short inverted repeats. We suggest that the N4 virion RNA polymerase recognizes the promoter only in a novel single-stranded form, and that the formation of the initiation complex is facilitated in vivo by supercoiling and E. coli single-stranded DNA binding protein. ;polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
2429;1547019;Characterization of a major member of the rat pregnancy-specific glycoprotein family.;The gene encoding the human pregnancy-specific glycoprotein (PSG) belongs to a gene subfamily, comprised of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and PSG subgroups, within the immunoglobulin superfamily. To study the functional roles of PSG during development in an animal model, we isolated and characterized a near full-length cDNA (rnCGM6) encoding a PSG-related protein from a rat placental cDNA library. rnCGM6 is 2,068 bp in length and contains an open reading frame that encodes a 475-amino-acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 53 kD. The 5' noncoding sequence is 173 nucleotides, and primer-extension experiments demonstrate that the transcriptional initiation site is located 22-24 nucleotides further upstream. The 3' noncoding sequence contains 470 nucleotides which is followed by a poly(A) tail. In contrast to human PSGs, which contain one immunoglobulin variable-like and two to three immunoglobulin constant-like protein domains, rnCGM6 contains three immunoglobulin variable-like domains and one immunoglobulin constant-like domain. rnCGM6 contains six potential N-linked glycosylation sites and, in its carboxyl-terminal domain, a tyrosine protein kinase phosphorylation site. The tyrosine phosphorylation site is conserved among all rat and human PSG members. rnCGM6 hybridized with a major 2.5-kb and two minor 3.0- and 3.5-kb mRNAs, all primarily expressed in the rat placenta. Ribonuclease protection analysis, using probes specific to the 5', middle, and 3' regions of rnCGM6, and the 5' region of a previously identified cDNA, rnCGM1, mainly yielded fully-protected fragments indicating relatively low sequence similarity among rat PSG-related proteins. Northern hybridization and ribonuclease protection assays also suggest that rnCGM6 may be the major PSG member in rat. ;polyalanine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
2431;8895526;Transcriptional activation of the syndecan-1 promoter by the Wilms' tumor protein WT1.;The Wilms' tumor suppressor gene (wt1) encodes a zinc finger DNA binding protein (WT1) which functions as a transcriptional regulator and is essential for normal urogenital development. WTI has previously been shown to repress the transcription of a variety of target genes whose products stimulate growth, such as growth factors, growth factor receptors and other transcription factors. In this study, we identify syndecan-1 as a target gene for WT1-mediated activation. Syndecan-1 is a cell surface proteoglycan whose induction is coincident with epithelial differentiation during kidney development and whose loss of expression is correlated with the loss of the epithelial phenotype and malignant transformation. The murine syndecan-1 promoter contains several potential binding sites for WT1. We demonstrate that both WT1 (-KTS) and WT1 (+KTS) isoforms bind to multiple sites in this highly G + C-rich region, as detected by gel-shift analyses. These WT1 isoforms function as transcriptional activators of syndecan-1 expression in transient transfection assays. Activation of syndecan-1 by WT1 is dependent on an intact zinc-finger region as well as a 179 amino acid proline-rich region in the amino terminus of the protein. Moreover, the endogenous syndecan-1 gene is activated by WT1 in a novel inducible cell line based upon the sheep metallothionein promoter. These results highlight an emerging role for WT1 as an activator of genes like syndecan-1 which may potentiate epithelial differentiation and maintenance in the developing kidney.;polyproline;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
2433;2034689;A systematic mutational analysis of hormone-binding determinants in the human growth hormone receptor.;A mutational strategy is presented that allowed us to identify hormone-binding determinants in the extracellular portion of the human growth hormone receptor (hGHbp), a 238-residue protein with sequence homology to a number of cytokine receptors. By systematically replacing side chains with alanine we probed the importance of charged residues (49 total, typically located on the surface), aromatic residues (9 total), and neighbors of these (26 total). The alanine substitutions that were most disruptive to hormone binding are located predominantly in four segments of a cysteine-rich domain in the hGHbp, and collectively they form a patch when mapped upon a structural model proposed for cytokine receptors. Control experiments with monoclonal antibodies confirmed that most of these alanine substitutions do not disrupt the overall antigenic structure of the hGHbp. This high-resolution functional analysis will complement structural studies and provides a powerful basis for evaluating and engineering the energetics of hormone-receptor interactions. Moreover, the hormone-binding determinants identified here may be similarly located in other, homologous, receptors.;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
2434;8602112;Endocytosis inhibition protects the isolated guinea pig heart against ouabain toxicity.;We have tested whether toxicity and uptake of ouabain are linked phenomena in isolated guinea-pig heart. We perfused toxic dose of either ouabain, dihydroouabain (hydrophilic cardiac steroids), ouabagenin or digitoxin (hydrophobic steroids) in conditions of endocytosis inhibited. We used two schemes of inhibition of endocytosis. First, we cooled the heart at 0-4 degrees C and exposed it 60 min to either 1 X 10(-6) M ouabain or 3 X 10(-7)M digitoxin. Upon rewarming, the heart exposed to ouabain relaxed with a shorter time constant than those exposed to digitoxin. Second, we perfused four receptor mediated endocytosis (RME) inhibitors at the same time that the cardiac glycosides. RME inhibitors significantly delayed the cardiac arrest caused by ouabain and dihydroouabain but they did not modify the toxicity of 3 X 10(-7)M digitoxin or 5 X 10(-6)M ouabagenin. None of RME inhibitors modified the toxicity of 0.5 mM K+ or zero Na+ saline solution. We suggest that the protection against ouabain toxicity brought by endocytosis inhibition, is related to the Na-pump recycling. We infer that besides the sarcolemmal exposed Na-pumps, the intracellular Na-pumps pool may be of importance for the pharmacological effects of digitalis steroids.;-;-;-;hard_0
2435;8221147;Convergence of gastric and hepatic information in brain stem neurons of the rat.;Convergence of gastric and hepatic information in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) was investigated by single-pulse electrical stimulation of the hepatic and the gastric branches of the vagus. Facilitation induced by both stimuli occurred most often in responses of neurons in the NTS, indicating convergence of information there. In a second experiment using gastric distension and portal infusion of glucose to analyze such convergence, activation by gastric distension and suppression by portal glucose was the most prominent combination of responses to both stimuli. This confirmed the results of electrical stimulation, because distension increases the firing rate of gastric afferents and glucose infusion decreases the firing rate of hepatic afferents. Analysis of the responses to varying degrees of gastric distension revealed that some NTS neurons are activated by weak distension, but inhibited by strong distensions.;-;-;-;hard_0
2436;10217327;Structure/activity studies of the anti-MUC1 monoclonal antibody C595 and synthetic MUC1 mucin-core-related peptides and glycopeptides.;MUC1 mucin is a large complex glycoprotein expressed on normal epithelial cells in humans and overexpressed and under or aberrantly glycosylated on many malignant cancer cells which consequently allows recognition of the protein core by antibodies. In order to understand how glycosylation may modulate or regulate antibody binding of mucin protein core epitopes, we have analyzed the antibody C595 (epitope RPAP) for its structure, stability, and its binding to a series of synthetic peptides and glycopeptides by a number of spectroscopic methods. Thermal and pH denaturation studies followed by changes in the CD spectrum of the antibody indicate critical involvement of specific residues to the stability of the antibody. Fluorescence binding studies indicate that alpha-N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) glycosylation of a MUC1 mucin synthetic peptide TAPPAHGVT9SAPDTRPAPGS20T21APPA at threonine residues 9 and 21 and serine residue 20 enhanced the binding of antibody. The structural effects of GalNAc glycosylation on the conformation of the MUC1 peptide were studied. CD of the peptides and glycopeptides in a cryogenic mixture cooled to approximately -97 degrees C revealed that a left-handed polyproline II helix (PPII) is adopted by the peptides in solution, which appears to be further stabilized by addition of the GalNAc residues. Consistent with the PPII helical structure, which has no intra-amide hydrogen bonds, high-field NMR spectroscopy of the glycopeptide revealed no sequential dNN, medium-range, or long-range nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) connectivities. These studies indicate that stabilization of the PPII helix by GalNAc glycosylation present the epitope of C595 antibody with a favorable conformation for binding. Furthermore, they illustrate that glycosylation of the MUC1 tumor marker protein with a simple O-linked saccharide expressed in many cancers, can enhance the binding of the clinically relevant C595 antibody. ;polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function
2437;8926104;V antigen-polyhistidine fusion peptide: binding to LcrH and active immunity against plague.;The structural gene for V antigen (lcrV) is known to be encoded within the lcrGVH-yopBD operon of the approximately 70-kb low-calcium-response or Lcr plasmid of Yersinia pestis. This 37-kDa monomeric peptide was reported to provide active immunity in mice, suppress inflammatory cytokines, and regulate expression of the low calcium response (Lcr+). Here we describe pVHB62, encoding a polyhistidine-V antigen fusion peptide (Vh) and linked LcrH. Vh underwent degradation from both the C terminus and N terminus during classical chromatographic fractionation but remained intact within two compartments during Ni2+ affinity chromatography. The first was homogeneous, capable of active immunization (mouse intravenous 50% lethal dose, > 10(7) bacteria), and stable at 4 degrees C. The second remained bound to the affinity column but could be eluted as a mixture of Vh, LcrH, and low-molecular-weight material by application of 6 M guanidine HCl. This mixture was dialyzed, denatured in 8 M urea, and again applied to the affinity column, which then hound Vh but not LcrH. The latter was recovered and renatured, and low-molecular-weight material was removed by biochemical fractionation. The resulting homogeneous LcrH bound protein AN antigen fusion peptide but not protein A in a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and this reaction was inhibited by Vh. These observations indicate that LcrH normally binds V antigen in bacterial cytoplasm and suggest that only free LcrH down-regulates expression of the low calcium response.;polyhistidine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
2440;9712014;The effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex on suppression of habitual counting during random number generation.;Random number generation is an attention-demanding task that engages working memory and executive processes. Random number generation requires holding information 'on line', suppression of habitual counting, internally driven response generation and monitoring of responses. Evidence from PET studies suggests that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is involved in the generation of random responses. We examined the effects of short trains of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the left or right DLPFC or medial frontal cortex on random number generation in healthy normal participants. As in previous evidence, in control trials without stimulation participants performed poorly on the random number generation task, showing repetition avoidance and a tendency to count. Brief disruption of processing with TMS over the left DLPFC changed the balance of the individuals' counting bias, increasing the most habitual counting in ones and reducing the lower probability response of counting in twos. This differential effect of TMS over the left DLPFC on the balance of the subject's counting bias was not obtained with TMS over the right DLPFC or the medial frontal cortex. The results suggest that, with disruption of the left DLPFC with TMS, habitual counting in ones that has previously been suppressed is released from inhibition. From these findings a network modulation model of random number generation is proposed, whereby suppression of habitual responses is achieved through the modulatory influence of the left DLPFC over a number-associative network in the superior temporal cortex. To allow emergence of appropriate random responses, the left DLPFC inhibits the superior temporal cortex to prevent spreading activation and habitual counting in ones.;-;-;-;hard_0
2442;24328073;Combining peptide and DNA for protein assay: CRIP1 detection for breast cancer staging.;In this work, a novel method for a protein assay is proposed which uses the specific protein-binding peptide of the target protein and sequence-specific DNA to interact with the target as the capture and detection probe, respectively. Meanwhile, since the DNA sequence can be coupled with gold nanoparticles to amplify the signal readout, a sensitive and easily operated method for protein assay is developed. We have also employed a transcription factor named as cysteine-rich intestinal protein 1 (CRIP1), which has been identified as an ideal biomarker for staging of breast cancer, as the model protein for this study. With the proposed method, CRIP1 can be determined in a linear range from 1.25 to 10.13 ng/mL, with a detection limit of 1.25 ng/mL. Furthermore, the proposed method can be directly used to assay CRIP1 in tissue samples. Owing to its desirable sensitivity, excellent reproducibility, and high selectivity, the proposed method may hold great potential in clinical practice in the future.  ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
2446;16373579;Diversity and function of adaptive immune receptors in a jawless vertebrate.;Instead of the immunoglobulin-type antigen receptors of jawed vertebrates, jawless fish have variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs), which consist of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) modules. Somatic diversification of the VLR gene is shown here to occur through a multistep assembly of LRR modules randomly selected from a large bank of flanking cassettes. The predicted concave surface of the VLR is lined with hypervariable positively selected residues, and computational analysis suggests a repertoire of about 10(14) unique receptors. Lamprey immunized with anthrax spores responded with the production of soluble antigen-specific VLRs. These findings reveal that two strikingly different modes of antigen recognition through rearranged lymphocyte receptors have evolved in the jawless and jawed vertebrates. ;polyleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
2447;19674106;The enzymatic activity of SR protein kinases 1 and 1a is negatively affected by interaction with scaffold attachment factors B1 and 2.;SR protein kinases (SRPKs) phosphorylate Ser/Arg dipeptide-containing proteins that play crucial roles in a broad spectrum of basic cellular processes. Phosphorylation by SRPKs constitutes a major way of regulating such cellular mechanisms. In the past, we have shown that SRPK1a interacts with the nuclear matrix protein scaffold attachment factor B1 (SAFB1) via its unique N-terminal domain, which differentiates it from SRPK1. In this study, we show that SAFB1 inhibits the activity of both SRPK1a and SRPK1 in vitro and that its RE-rich region is redundant for the observed inhibition. We demonstrate that kinase activity inhibition is caused by direct binding of SAFB1 to SRPK1a and SRPK1, and we also present evidence for the in vitro binding of SAFB2 to the two kinases, albeit with different affinity. Moreover, we show that both SR protein kinases can form complexes with both scaffold attachment factors B in living cells and that this interaction is capable of inhibiting their activity, depending on the tenacity of the complex formed. Finally, we present data demonstrating that SRPK/SAFB complexes are present in the nucleus of HeLa cells and that the enzymatic activity of the nuclear matrixlocalized SRPK1 is repressed. These results suggest a new role for SAFB proteins as regulators of SRPK activity and underline the importance of the assembly of transient intranuclear complexes in cellular regulation. ;polyglutamic;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
2448;24464995;The crystal structure of TDP-43 RRM1-DNA complex reveals the specific recognition for UG- and TG-rich nucleic acids.;"TDP-43 is an important pathological protein that aggregates in the diseased neuronal cells and is linked to various neurodegenerative disorders. In normal cells, TDP-43 is primarily an RNA-binding protein; however, how the dimeric TDP-43 binds RNA via its two RNA recognition motifs, RRM1 and RRM2, is not clear. Here we report the crystal structure of human TDP-43 RRM1 in complex with a single-stranded DNA showing that RRM1 binds the nucleic acid extensively not only by the conserved β-sheet residues but also by the loop residues. Mutational and biochemical assays further reveal that both RRMs in TDP-43 dimers participate in binding of UG-rich RNA or TG-rich DNA with RRM1 playing a dominant role and RRM2 playing a supporting role. Moreover, RRM1 of the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-linked mutant D169G binds DNA as efficiently as the wild type; nevertheless, it is more resistant to thermal denaturation, suggesting that the resistance to degradation is likely linked to TDP-43 proteinopathies. Taken together all the data, we suggest a model showing that the two RRMs in each protomer of TDP-43 homodimer work together in RNA binding and thus the dimeric TDP-43 recognizes long clusters of UG-rich RNA to achieve high affinity and specificity.

2449;7132814;Language and the brain: implications from new computer models.;"Computer systems for processing and ""understanding"" natural language have, up to now, used semantic and syntactic procedures that provide meanings of words in terms only of other words or some structural algorithms that ultimately relate to other words. There is a long-standing and widely held belief that words, or their unknown neuronal correlates, are fundamental to verbal meaning, concepts, and thought but over the last decade, evidence has been accumulating in neurology and psychology to indicate that this is not so. We have developed a new computer system for representing the meaning of words and sentences, by which word meanings are described non-verbally in terms of sensorimotor and other modality codes. It is suggested here that the principles of this system might usefully be applied to understanding the cerebral mechanisms of some verbal and cognitive processes and their disorders. In particular the hypothesis is proposed that verbal meaning is essentially non-verbal, and that it may be represented, for both words and sentences in terms of interassociated modal percepts or their neuronal correlates.";-;-;-;hard_0
2455;1508206;Drosophila transcriptional repressor protein that binds specifically to negative control elements in fat body enhancers.;Expression of the Drosophila melanogaster Adh gene in adults requires a fat body-specific enhancer called the Adh adult enhancer (AAE). We have identified a protein in Drosophila nuclear extracts that binds specifically to a site within the AAE (adult enhancer factor 1 [AEF-1]). In addition, we have shown that AEF-1 binds specifically to two other Drosophila fat body enhancers. Base substitutions in the AEF-1 binding site that disrupt AEF-1 binding in vitro result in a significant increase in the level of Adh expression in vivo. Thus, the AEF-1 binding site is a negative regulatory element within the AAE. A cDNA encoding the AEF-1 protein was isolated and shown to act as a repressor of the AAE in cotransfection studies. The AEF-1 protein contains four zinc fingers and an alanine-rich sequence.

2456;24307175;Probing the dynamic distribution of bound states for methylcytosine-binding domains on DNA.;Although highly homologous to other methylcytosine-binding domain (MBD) proteins, MBD3 does not selectively bind methylated DNA, and thus the functional role of MBD3 remains in question. To explore the structural basis of its binding properties and potential function, we characterized the solution structure and binding distribution of the MBD3 MBD on hydroxymethylated, methylated, and unmethylated DNA. The overall fold of this domain is very similar to other MBDs, yet a key loop involved in DNA binding is more disordered than previously observed. Specific recognition of methylated DNA constrains the structure of this loop and results in large chemical shift changes in NMR spectra. Based on these spectral changes, we show that MBD3 preferentially localizes to methylated and, to a lesser degree, unmethylated cytosine-guanosine dinucleotides (CpGs), yet does not distinguish between hydroxymethylated and unmethylated sites. Measuring residual dipolar couplings for the different bound states clearly shows that the MBD3 structure does not change between methylation-specific and nonspecific binding modes. Furthermore, residual dipolar couplings measured for MBD3 bound to methylated DNA can be described by a linear combination of those for the methylation and nonspecific binding modes, confirming the preferential localization to methylated sites. The highly homologous MBD2 protein shows similar but much stronger localization to methylated as well as unmethylated CpGs. Together, these data establish the structural basis for the relative distribution of MBD2 and MBD3 on genomic DNA and their observed occupancy at active and inactive CpG-rich promoters.  ;polyglycine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
2463;31768982;Purification and In Vitro Analysis of the Exosome Cofactors Nrd1-Nab3 and Trf4-Air2.;In many eukaryotic organisms from yeast to human, the exosome plays an important role in the control of pervasive transcription and in non-coding RNA (ncRNA) processing and quality control by trimming precursor RNAs and degrading aberrant transcripts. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae this function is enabled by the interaction of the exosome with several cofactors: the Nrd1-Nab3 heterodimer and the Trf4-Air2-Mtr4 (TRAMP4) complex. Nrd1 and Nab3 are RNA binding proteins that recognize specific motifs enriched in the target ncRNAs, whereas TRAMP4 adds polyA tails at the 3' end of transcripts and stimulates RNA degradation by the exosome.

2472;17404236;Hydrophobic association of alpha-helices, steric dewetting, and enthalpic barriers to protein folding.;Efficient protein folding implies a microscopic funnel-like multidimensional free-energy landscape. Macroscopically, conformational entropy reduction can manifest itself as part of an empirical barrier in the traditional view of folding, but experiments show that such barriers can also entail significant unfavorable enthalpy changes. This observation raises the puzzling possibility, irrespective of conformational entropy, that individual microscopic folding trajectories may encounter large uphill moves and thus the multidimensional free-energy landscape may not be funnel-like. Here, we investigate how nanoscale hydrophobic interactions might underpin this salient enthalpic effect in biomolecular assembly by computer simulations of the association of two preformed polyalanine or polyleucine helices in water. We observe a high, positive enthalpic signature at room temperature when the helix separation is less than a single layer of water molecules. Remarkably, this unfavorable enthalpy change, with a parallel increase in void volume, is largely compensated for by a concomitant increase in solvent entropy, netting only a small or nonexistent microscopic free-energy barrier. Thus, our findings suggest that high enthalpic folding barriers can be consistent with a funnel picture of folding and are mainly a desolvation phenomenon indicative of a cooperative mechanism of simultaneous formation of multiple side-chain contacts at the rate-limiting step. ;polyleucine;helix;-;LCR_with_function

Computer analyses indicated that these viruses can be divided into two discrete groups. SRSV group I contains the previously characterized antigenic type 1 Norwalk and type 3 Southampton viruses. The amino acid sequences of the RNA polymerase, capsid and ORF3 of these two viruses are relatively similar (about 92%, 69% and 72% amino acid identity, respectively). A representative member of group II SRSVs, Bristol virus, was subjected to a detailed genetic analysis. Bristol virus is a recent antigenic type 2 isolate from a U.K. hospital outbreak of gastroenteritis. Using a single clinical sample the 3'-terminal 3881 nucleotide cDNA sequence [excluding the poly(A) tail] of this virus was determined. Analysis of the sequence revealed significant differences from those of group I viruses with the RNA polymerase region, capsid and ORF3 showing only about 62%, 43% and 30% amino acid identity respectively with the equivalent proteins of the Norwalk and Southampton viruses. These data suggest that the morphologically identical SRSVs belong to at least two genetically distinct groups.; polyalanine ;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

The nucleotide sequence of a 3.1-kbp fur-specific cDNA isolated from a human cDNA library revealed an open reading frame of 1,498 bp from which the 499 carboxy-terminal amino acids of the primary fur translational product could be deduced. Computer analysis indicated that furin contained a possible transmembrane domain which resembled that of class II MHC antigens. Furthermore, a cysteine-rich region was present.

ETO, an agent used to sterilize dialyzers, is a potent alkylator of proteins. We have studied the antigenic characteristics of ETO-HSA. By use of immunoelectrophoresis we have demonstrated differences in electrophoretic mobility between HSA and ETO-HSA. By gel chromatography we have observed an apparent increase in the molecular weight of ETO-HSA as compared to HSA. Antigenic activity of ETO-HSA as determined by the technique of Lidd and Farr is found in all molecular weight fractions. Cutaneous reactivity to ETO-HSA can be transferred to subhuman primates. That reactivity is lost if the sera are heated to 56 degrees C for 4 hours. Antibody activity to ETO-HSA cannot be inhibited by ETO-glycine or HSA but can partially be inhibited by ETO-polylysine or ETO-ovalbumin.

2484;26823170;Host-parasite interaction: multiple sites in the Plasmodium vivax tryptophan-rich antigen PvTRAg38 interact with the erythrocyte receptor band 3.;Tryptophan-rich antigens of malarial parasites interact with host molecules and play an important role in parasite survival. Merozoite expressed Plasmodium vivax tryptophan-rich antigen PvTRAg38 binds to human erythrocytes and facilitates parasite growth in a heterlologous Plasmodium falciparum culture system. Recently, we identified band 3 in human erythrocytes as one of its receptors, although the receptor-ligand binding mechanisms remain unknown. In the present study, using synthetic mutated peptides of PvTRAg38, we show that multiple amino acid residues of its 12 amino acid domain (KWVQWKNDKIRS) at position 197-208 interact with three different ectodomains of band 3 receptor on human erythrocytes. Our findings may help in the design of new therapeutic approaches for malaria.  ;polytryptophan;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
2486;6440477;Postantibiotic effect of imipenem on Pseudomonas aeruginosa.;Imipenem (formerly N-formimidoyl thienamycin) and ceftazidime were investigated for their postantibiotic effect on Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Four strains of P. aeruginosa in the logarithmic phase of growth were exposed for 1 and 2 h to concentrations of antibiotics achievable in human serum. Recovery periods of test cultures were evaluated after dilution or addition of beta-lactamase. A consistent postantibiotic effect against all strains was obtained with imipenem but not with ceftazidime. Although ceftazidime did not have a postantibiotic effect, it did suppress the growth of the organisms at concentrations equivalent to one-third of the MIC. The clinical implications of these effects need further evaluation.;-;-;-;hard_0
2488;9218412;SH3-mediated Hck tyrosine kinase activation and fibroblast transformation by the Nef protein of HIV-1.;Tyrosine kinases of the Src family are regulated via their Src homology 2 (SH2) and SH3 domains. The Nef protein of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) has previously been shown to bind with high affinity and specificity in vitro to the SH3 domain of Hck, a Src family member expressed primarily in myeloid cells. However, the effect of Nef on Hck activity in living cells is unknown. Here we show that Rat-2 fibroblasts co-expressing Hck and Nef rapidly developed transformed foci, whereas control cells expressing either protein alone did not. Nef formed a stable complex with Hck and stimulated its tyrosine kinase activity in vivo. Mutagenesis of the Nef proline-rich motif essential for SH3 binding completely blocked complex formation, kinase activation, and transformation, indicating that the Nef SH3-binding function is required for its effects on Hck. These results provide direct evidence that SH3 engagement is sufficient to activate a Src family kinase in vivo and suggest that Hck may be activated by Nef in HIV-infected macrophages. ;polyproline;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function

2499;7849413;Co-management of patients with diabetes.;Co-management of the diabetic patient emphasizes interdisciplinary care between optometry and ophthalmology, and between optometry and the patient's primary physician. For the optometrist and the patient's primary physician, the emphasis is on written communication with regard to the ocular health of the patient's eyes. The optometrist also participates in educating patients about the complications related to diabetes mellitus, as well as reinforcing medical compliance and encouraging lifestyle changes for better health. By providing this scope of care, optometry becomes an integral part of the health care team. Between ophthalmology and optometry, the success of co-managing diabetic patients will be dependent on several factors, including demonstrating expertise in managing diabetic retinopathy, making timely and appropriate referrals based on results from national clinical trials, and developing a trusting relationship built over time. This paper emphasizes the multi-dimensional role the optometrist plays in the co-management of the diabetic patient with the patient's primary physician and with the ophthalmologist in treating and managing diabetic retinopathy.;-;-;-;hard_0
2500;27402841;Novel Roles and Mechanism for Krüppel-like Factor 16 (KLF16) Regulation of Neurite Outgrowth and Ephrin Receptor A5 (EphA5) Expression in Retinal Ganglion Cells.;Regenerative medicine holds great promise for the treatment of degenerative retinal disorders. Krüppel-like factors (KLFs) are transcription factors that have recently emerged as key tools in regenerative medicine because some of them can function as epigenetic reprogrammers in stem cell biology. Here, we show that KLF16, one of the least understood members of this family, is a POU4F2 independent transcription factor in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) as early as embryonic day 15. When overexpressed, KLF16 inhibits RGC neurite outgrowth and enhances RGC growth cone collapse in response to exogenous ephrinA5 ligands. Ephrin/EPH signaling regulates RGC connectivity. The EphA5 promoter contains multiple GC- and GT-rich KLF-binding sites, which, as shown by ChIP-assays, bind KLF16 in vivo In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, KLF16 binds specifically to a single KLF site near the EphA5 transcription start site that is required for KLF16 transactivation. Interestingly, methylation of only six of 98 CpG dinucleotides within the EphA5 promoter blocks its transactivation by KLF16 but enables transactivation by KLF2 and KLF15. These data demonstrate a role for KLF16 in regulation of RGC neurite outgrowth and as a methylation-sensitive transcriptional regulator of EphA5 expression. Together, these data identify differential low level methylation as a novel mechanism for regulating KLF16-mediated EphA5 expression across the retina. Because of the critical role of ephrin/EPH signaling in patterning RGC connectivity, understanding the role of KLFs in regulating neurite outgrowth and Eph receptor expression will be vital for successful restoration of functional vision through optic nerve regenerative therapies. ;polythreonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

2504;9271630;Structure and diversity of the heavy chain VDJ junctions in the developing Mexican axolotl.;The immune capacity of young and adult axolotls (Ambystoma mexicanum) was evaluated by examining the combinatorial and junctional diversity of the VH chain. A large number of VDJ rearrangements isolated from 2.5-, 3.5-, 10-, and 24-month-old animals were sequenced. Six JH segments were identified with the canonical structure of all known vertebrate JHs, including the conserved Trp103-Gly104-X-Gly106 motif. Four core DH-like sequences were used by most (80%) of the VDJ junctions. These G-rich sequences had structures reminiscent of the TCRB DB sequences, and were equally used in their three reading frames. About 25% of the Igh, VDJ junctions from 3.5-month-old axolotls were out of frame, but most rearrangements were in frame at 10 and 24 months, suggesting that there is active selection of the productively rearranged Igh chains in the developing animals. There was no significant difference between the size of CDR3 in young (3.5 months) and subadult (10 months) axolotls (mean: 8.5 amino acids). However, the CDR3 loop was 1 amino acid longer in 2-year-old adult animals (mean: 9.5 residues). Several pairs of identical VDJ/CDR3 sequences were shared between 3.5-month-old individually analyzed axolotls, or between groups of axolotl of different ages. These identical rearrangements might be provided by the selection of some B-cell clones important for species survival, although the probability that different 3.5-month-old axolotl larvae would produce identical junctions seems very low, considering their limited number of B cells (less than 10(5)). The high frequency of tyrosine residues and the paucity of charged residues in the axolotl CDR3 loops may explain the polyreactivity of natural antibodies, and also clarify why it is so difficult to raise specific antibodies against soluble antigens.; polyglycine ;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

2512;8991299;Models of scientific progress and the role of theory in taxonomy development: a case study of the DSM.;"The proliferation of categories in recent editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (e.g., 4th ed.; DSM; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) is discussed as an indication that the underlying classification scheme is inadequate and unlikely to produce the scientific progress originally envisioned. In any nosological system, it eventually becomes necessary to reduce the number of categories by an organizing theory that describes the fundamental principles underlying the taxonomy. The DSM has put itself in an awkward position by claiming to be atheoretical. Although taking such a tack had historical advantages to promote the acceptability of the 3rd edition of the DSM, it now limits the progression of science. It is argued that the DSM should not be used as the basis for guiding scientific research programs because it emphasizes primarily behavioral topography rather than providing an explicit theory that would allow for an evaluation of scientific progress. Theoretically driven taxonomies should be allowed to compete on the basis of how successful they are at achieving their specified goals that might include illuminating etiology, course, and response to treatment. Such systems are not likely to attend primarily to behavioral topography alone and would probably organize behavior differently than the current categorical syndromes seen in the 4th edition of the DSM.";-;-;-;hard_0

Ischemia depressed mechanical function, which was not restored by reperfusion of 20 min. Preischemic administration of K-7259 (N,N'-bis[4-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)butyl]homopiperazine dihydrochloride) (1, 5 or 10 microM) decreased the function before ischemia, but it attenuated the ischemia-induced dysfunction during reperfusion (20 min).

2529;28453723;GTP binding regulates cellular localization of Parkinson's disease-associated LRRK2.;Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) comprise the most common cause of familial Parkinson's disease (PD), and sequence variants modify risk for sporadic PD. Previous studies indicate that LRRK2 interacts with microtubules (MTs) and alters MT-mediated vesicular transport processes. However, the molecular determinants within LRRK2 required for such interactions have remained unknown. Here, we report that most pathogenic LRRK2 mutants cause relocalization of LRRK2 to filamentous structures which colocalize with a subset of MTs, and an identical relocalization is seen upon pharmacological LRRK2 kinase inhibition. The pronounced colocalization with MTs does not correlate with alterations in LRRK2 kinase activity, but rather with increased GTP binding. Synthetic mutations which impair GTP binding, as well as LRRK2 GTP-binding inhibitors profoundly interfere with the abnormal localization of both pathogenic mutant as well as kinase-inhibited LRRK2. Conversely, addition of a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog to permeabilized cells enhances the association of pathogenic or kinase-inhibited LRRK2 with MTs. Our data elucidate the mechanism underlying the increased MT association of select pathogenic LRRK2 mutants or of pharmacologically kinase-inhibited LRRK2, with implications for downstream MT-mediated transport events. ;polyleucine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function

2539;30348309;Physical interaction between nuclear accumulated CC-NB-ARC-LRR protein and WRKY64 promotes EDS1 dependent Fusarium wilt resistance in chickpea.;Fusarium wilt is one of the most serious diseases affecting chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.). Here, we identified a putative Resistance Gene Analog (CaRGA) from chickpea, encoding a coiled-coil (CC) nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NB-ARC) containing leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein (CC-NLR protein) that confers resistance against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceri race1 (Foc1). Over-expression and silencing of CaRGA in chickpea resulted in enhanced resistance and hyper-susceptibility, respectively against Foc1. Furthermore, defense response to Foc1 depends on CC-NLR interaction with WRKY64 transcription factor. CaRGA mediated wilt resistance largely compromised when WRKY64 was silenced. We also determined in planta intramolecular interactions and self-association of chickpea CC-NLR protein. The study shows CC domain suppressing auto-activation of the full-length CC-NLR protein in the absence of pathogen through self-inhibitory intramolecular interaction with NB-ARC domain, which is attenuated by self-interactions to LRR domain. Chickpea CC-NLR protein forms homocomplexes and then interacts with WRKY64. CC-NLR protein further phosphorylates WRKY64 thereby, ubiquitination and proteasome mediated degradation are protected. Phosphorylated WRKY64 with increased stability binds to EDS1 promoter and stimulates its transcription that induces in planta ectopic cell-death. The detailed analysis of CC-NLR and WRKY interactions provide a better understanding of the immune regulation by NLR proteins under biotic stresses. ;polyleucine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
2541;9406077;Application of a U-13C-labeled amino acid tracer in lactating dairy goats for simultaneous measurements of the flux of amino acids in plasma and the partition of amino acids to the mammary gland.;"A preliminary study was conducted using lactating British Saanen goats (n = 5) at 109 to 213 d in milk that yielded 1.67 to 3.68 kg of milk/d to examine the application of a U-13C-labeled amino acid (AA) mixture obtained from hydrolyzed algal proteins as a tracer for measuring plasma flux (n = 5) and partition to the mammary gland (n = 3; arteriovenous difference) of 13 AA simultaneously. Except for Ile and Ser, there was incomplete (6 to 54%) equilibration of the tracer with AA from packed blood cells (> 90% erythrocytes) during the 6-h infusions. This result agreed with the large ratio of packed cells to gradients for plasma AA concentration that was also observed. However, net mass and isotope removals by the mammary gland were predominantly from plasma, indicating that the erythrocytes did not participate in kinetic exchanges. Plasma AA fluxes (millimoles per kilogram of metabolizable protein intake per kilogram of body weight 0.75) differed among goats that consumed different protein sources; however, overall rates were lowest for Met (5 to 14) and His (8 to 17) and highest for Leu (48 to 70) and Ala (53 to 88). On average, 25% of plasma flux was partitioned to the mammary gland. Less than 20% of His, Ser, Phe, and Ala were directed to the mammary gland; 20 to 30% of Arg, Thr, Tyr, and Leu were directed to the mammary gland; and 30 to 40% of Pro, Ile, Lys, and Val were directed to the mammary gland. The unidirectional AA flux in the mammary gland (AA apparently available for protein syntheses, oxidation, and metabolite formation) did not match the pattern that is required for casein synthesis, suggesting differences in the metabolic requirements of AA for nonmilk protein synthesis.";-;-;-;hard_0
2542;36128458;Unraveling templated-regulated distribution of isolated SiO4 tetrahedra in silicoaluminophosphate zeolites with high-throughput computations.;Silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) zeolites are well-known catalytic materials because of the mild acidity originating from the isolated SiO4 tetrahedra in their frameworks. Regulating the distribution of isolated SiO4 tetrahedra in SAPO zeolites is formidably challenging because SiO4 tetrahedra tend to agglomerate to form Si islands and the isolated SiO4 tetrahedra are difficult to determine using conventional characterization techniques. Here we synthesized Si-island-free SAPO-35 zeolites by using N-methylpiperidine as a new template, which exhibited excellent thermal stability compared to conventional SAPO-35 zeolites and a substantially improved methanol-to-olefins catalytic lifetime even comparable to that of commercial SAPO-34 zeolites. More strikingly, with the aid of high-throughput computations on 44 697 structure models combined with various state-of-the-art characterization techniques, for the first time, we reveal that the host-guest interactions between template molecules and SAPO frameworks determine the specific distributions of isolated SiO4 tetrahedra, which are responsible for the improvement in the chemical properties of zeolites. Our work provides an insight into the template-based regulation of isolated SiO4 tetrahedra in SAPO zeolites, which opens a new avenue in the discovery of promising zeolite catalysts with optimal SiO4 distribution.;-;-;-;hard_0

These antigens included cytoskeletal proteins vimentin, filamin B, and cofilin-1, but also phosphorylcholine-containing antigens (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae polysaccharides and oxidized low-density lipoprotein [oxLDL]). Additional new antigens identified were cardiolipin and proline-rich acidic protein-1. Remarkably, these antigens represent molecular motifs exposed on apoptotic cells/blebs and bacteria, and several CLL Igs bound to apoptotic Jurkat cells. In conclusion, these intriguing data, showing a limited target structure recognition, indicate that CD5+ CLL B cells are derived from a cell compartment that produces ""natural antibodies,"" which may be instrumental in elimination and scavenging of apoptotic cells and pathogenic bacteria.

Here we report on the discovery of small molecule inhibitors of the phosphatase activity of PHLPP, a member of the PP2C family of phosphatases for which there are no general pharmacological inhibitors. First, the Diversity Set of the NCI was screened for inhibition of the purified phosphatase domain of PHLPP2 in vitro. Second, selected libraries from the open NCI database were docked into a virtual model of the phosphatase domain of PHLPP2, previously trained with our experimental data set, unveiling additional inhibitors. Biochemical and cellular assays resulted in the identification of two structurally diverse compounds that selectively inhibit PHLPP in vitro, increase Akt signaling in cells, and prevent apoptosis. Thus, chemical and virtual screening has resulted in the identification of small molecules that promote Akt signaling by inhibiting its negative regulator PHLPP. ; polyleucine ;phosphatase activity;-;LCR_with_function
2555;1702426;Isolation and partial characterization of the gene for goose fatty acid synthase.;"Fatty acid synthase is regulated by diet and hormones, with regulation being primarily transcriptional. In chick embryo hepatocytes in culture, triiodothyronine stimulates accumulation of enzyme and transcription of the gene. Since the 5'-flanking region of this gene is likely involved in hormonal regulation of its expression, we have isolated and partially characterized an avian fatty acid synthase gene. A genomic DNA library was constructed in a cosmid vector and screened with cDNA clones that contained sequence complementary to the 3' end of goose fatty acid synthase mRNA. A genomic clone (approximately 35 kilobase pairs (kb] was isolated, and a 6.5-kb EcoRI fragment thereof contained DNA complementary to the 3' noncoding region of fatty acid synthase mRNA. Additional cosmid libraries were screened with 5' fragments of previously isolated genomic clones, resulting in the isolation of five overlapping cosmid DNAs. The entire region of cloned DNA spans approximately 105 kb. Exon-containing fragments were identified by hybridization with end-labeled poly(A)+ RNA and by hybridization of labeled exon-containing genomic DNA fragments to fatty acid synthase mRNA. A new set of cDNA clones spanning approximately 3.2 kb was isolated from a lambda-ZAP goose liver cDNA library using the 5'-most exon-containing fragment of the 5'-most genomic DNA clone. This region of mRNA contains a 5'-untranslated sequence and a continuous open reading frame which includes a region that codes for the essential cysteine of the beta-ketoacyl synthase domain. The entire fatty acid synthase gene spans about 50 kb. The 5' 15 kb of the gene contain 7 exons. S1 nuclease and primer extension analyses were used to identify a single site for initiation of transcription, 174 nucleotides upstream from the putative translation initiation codon. Putative ""TATA"" and ""CCAAT"" boxes are located 28 and 60 base pairs (bp), respectively, upstream of the site of initiation of transcription. The 5'-flanking 597 bp of DNA contains G/C-rich sequences including several ""GC"" boxes corresponding to binding sites for the nuclear transcription factor Sp1. Putative sites for AP-2, C/EBP, and the triiodothyronine and glucocorticoid receptors also were found in this region.

2556;10593950;Presence of WT1, the Wilm's tumor suppressor gene product, in nuclear poly(A)(+) ribonucleoprotein.;"The tumor suppressor gene WT1 encodes a zinc finger protein, which consists of four C-terminal C(2)-H(2) zinc fingers of the Krüppel type, and at the N terminus a Q/P-rich trans-regulatory domain, both characteristic of transcription factors. However, recent findings suggest that WT1 may also be involved in a post-transcriptional process. Specifically, WT1 isoforms containing the alternatively spliced exon 9 (+lysine-threonine-serine (KTS)) preferentially associate with nuclear speckles and co-immunoprecipitate splicing antigens (Larsson, S.

(1998) Genes Dev. 12, 3217-3225) and binds to RNA in vitro (Caricasole, A., Duarte, A., Larsson, S. H., Hastie, N. D., Little, M., Holmes, G., Todorov, I., and Ward, A. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

To extend these findings, we have fractionated nuclear extracts to see if particles containing WT1 have the properties of ribonucleoprotein (RNP). In summary, WT1 is enriched by oligo(dT) chromatography, as are U2AF65, the U5 small nuclear RNP-associated protein p116 and hnRNP A1. Gel filtration and sedimentation profiles suggest that WT1 is present in RNase-sensitive particles, >2 MDa in size, peaking at approximately 60 S, and approximately 1.27 g/cm(3) on Nycodenz. Similar results were obtained from two cell lines expressing WT1, fetal kidneys (day E17), and transiently transfected cells, suggesting that the presence of WT1 protein in nuclear poly(A)(+) RNP is a general aspect of WT1 function.

For the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the slope k was ～0.6 for Mexico and ～2 for other countries. The two-population model was proposed to explain this phenomenon (Yoshikura H. Jpn J Infect Dis. 2012;65:279-88; Yoshikura H. Jpn J Infect Dis. 2009;62:411-2; and Yoshikura H. Jpn J Infect Dis. 2009;62:482-4). The current article reviews and analyzes previous influenza epidemics in Japan to examine whether the two-population model is applicable to them. The slope k was found to be ～2 for the Spanish flu during 1918-1920 and the Asian flu during 1957-1958, and ～1 for the Hong Kong flu and seasonal influenza prior to 1960-1961; however, k was ～0.6 for seasonal influenza after 1960-1961. This transition of the slope k of seasonal influenza plots from ～1 to ～0.6 corresponded to the shift in influenza mortality toward the older age groups and a drastic reduction in infant mortality rates due to improvements in the standard of living during the 1950s and 1960s. All the above observations could be well explained by reconstitution of the influenza epidemic based on the two-population model.";-;-;-;hard_0

Protein sequencing, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and immunoblot analyses identify p54 and p47/48 as members of the hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (HNF3 [forkhead]) family of transcription factors. p54 belongs to the subfamily of HNF3 beta proteins, while p47/48 binding activity includes HNF3 gamma. The cDNAs for two HNF3 beta proteins differing only in N-terminal amino acid sequences were isolated from a pancreatic cDNA library. The mRNAs encoding the two protein species accumulate to different steady-state levels in poly(A)+ RNA of pancreatic cells. Our results support a model by which the pancreas-specific expression of the alpha-amylase gene is mediated by a combination of cell-specific and cell lineage-specific transcription factors.;polythreonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
2559;7490114;Evidence for monoclonal expansion of synovial T cells bearing V alpha 2.1/V beta 5.5 gene segments and recognizing a synthetic peptide that shares homology with a number of putative autoantigens.;A peptide of 15 amino acids derived from the cereal glycine-rich cell wall protein (GRP), sharing a significant homology with Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1), fibrillar and procollagen, stimulated synovial fluid (SF) T cells from juvenile (JRA) and adult (RA) rheumatoid arthritis patients. An overexpression of the V alpha 2 gene family was found in the SF from patients who responded significantly to the peptide. To investigate in more detail the SF T-cell responses to the GRP peptide, we established peptide-specific T-cell lines and clones from a DR8+ positive JRA patient with pauciarticular form. The T-cell clones were phenotyped as T-cell receptor (TCR)alpha beta+/CD4+ and their clonality was investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and flow cytometric analysis. TCR sequences from different clones demonstrated that the clones were identical and used the V alpha 2.1/J alpha 6 combined with V beta 5.5/J beta 2.7 gene segments. Interestingly, direct sequencing of the V alpha 2 family PCR product obtained from cDNA prepared from freshly isolated SF mononuclear cells identified the same TCR sequence as that used by the clones, suggesting the monoclonality of SF CD4+ T cells bearing V alpha 2.1/J alpha 6 gene products. The present data suggest a recruitment and expansion of a SF T-cell subpopulation, and also support the hypothesis that autoimmune diseases can be triggered by protein epitopes with crucial amino acids homologous to self-proteins.; polyglycine ;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
2561;11923282;Regulation of metallothionein transcription by the metal-responsive transcription factor MTF-1: identification of signal transduction cascades that control metal-inducible transcription.;Every living organism must detoxify nonessential metals and carefully control the intracellular concentration of essential metals. Metallothioneins, which are small, cysteine-rich, metal-binding proteins, play an important role in these processes. In addition, the transcription of their cognate genes is activated in response to metal exposure. The zinc finger transcription factor MTF-1 plays a central role in the metal-inducible transcriptional activation of metallothionein and other genes involved in metal homeostasis and cellular stress response. Here we report that the phosphorylation of MTF-1 plays a critical role in its activation by zinc and cadmium. Inhibitor studies indicate that multiple kinases and signal transduction cascades, including those mediated by protein kinase C, tyrosine kinase, and casein kinase II, are essential for zinc- and cadmium-inducible transcriptional activation. In addition, calcium signaling is also involved in regulating metal-activated transcription. In contrast, cAMP-dependent protein kinase may not be directly involved in the metal response. Contrary to what has been reported for other transcription factors, inhibition of transcriptional activation does not impair the binding of MTF-1 to DNA, suggesting that phosphorylation is not regulating DNA binding. Elevated phosphorylation of MTF-1 is observed under condition of protein kinase C inhibition, suggesting that specific dephosphorylation of this transcription factor contributes to its activation. ;polycysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
2562;9798033;Infections due to non-O1 Vibrio cholerae in southern Taiwan: predominance in cirrhotic patients.;"Although Taiwan is not an area where cholera is endemic, from October 1988 to October 1997 30 episodes of non-O1, non-O139 Vibrio cholerae infection were noted at the National Cheng Kung University Hospital in Taiwan. Infections generally occurred in hot seasons, and two episodes were concomitant with Vibrio vulnificus infection. Three major clinical presentations were found: bacteremia with concurrent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or invasive soft-tissue infections that occurred solely in cirrhotic patients; self-limited acute febrile gastroenteritis that occurred in patients with no underlying medical disease; and necrotizing fasciitis or cellulitis that often resulted from a wound on extremities. Other manifestations included fatal pneumonitis in a drowned man and acute pyosalpinx. The differential diagnosis of invasive infections in cirrhotic patients should include infections due to non-O1 V. cholerae or V. vulnificus, and a third-generation cephalosporin and a tetracycline analogue or a fluoroquinolone alone is recommended for treatment of severe vibrio infections.";-;-;-;hard_0

On the basis of previous reports, we selected eight Brucella proteins (OMP36, OMP25, OMP19, OMP16, OMP10, p17, p15, and p39) as candidate antigens to be further evaluated. The genes encoding these proteins were cloned, sequenced, and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant proteins were purified with a polyhistidine tag and metal chelate affinity chromatography and evaluated in an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA). The specificity of the iELISA was determined with sera from healthy cattle, sheep, and goats and ranged from 95 to 99%, depending on the recombinant antigen and the species tested. Sera from experimentally infected, and from naturally infected, animals were used to evaluate the sensitivity of the iELISA. The antiprotein antibody response was often delayed when compared to the anti-smooth LPS (S-LPS) response and was limited to animals which developed an active brucellosis infection (experimentally infected pregnant animals and sheep and goats from areas where brucellosis is still endemic). Among the recombinant antigens, the three cytoplasmic proteins (p17, p15, and p39) gave the most useful results. More than 80% of the animals positive in S-LPS serology were also positive with one of these cytoplasmic proteins alone or a combination of two of them. None of the recombinant antigens detected experimentally infected nonpregnant cows and sheep or naturally infected cattle. This study is a first step towards the development of a multiprotein diagnostic reagent for brucellosis.;polyhistidine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
2564;27218834;Recent advances in marine N-cycle studies using 15N labeling methods.;15N enriched compounds such as ammonium and nitrate, as well as 15-15N2 gas are invaluable tools in marine N-cycle research. 15N stable isotope approaches allow researchers to delve into the often complex world of N-transformations and trace microbially mediated processes such as nitrification, denitrification, anammox and N-fixation. While 15N stable isotope approaches are well established, experimental approaches which take advantage of them are constantly evolving. Here we summarize recent advances in methodology, including in the direct application of 15N stable isotopes themselves, improved experimental design and the use of 15N stable isotopes in single cell studies. Furthermore, we discuss how these advances have led to new insights into marine N-cycling, particularly in the fields of nitrification and N-fixation.;-;-;-;hard_0
2565;35367339;The TIAR-mediated Nrf2 response to oxidative stress is mediated through the Nrf2 noncoding 3'untranslated region in Spodoptera litura.;"Nrf2 is a key regulator in the maintenance of cellular redox balance by regulating the expression of genes related to antioxidative responses and detoxification. Nrf2 protein levels are increased in response to oxidative stress. However, the regulation of the Nrf2 3'UTR on Nrf2 translation is unclear. Here, we report that the translational activity of the 3'UTR is required for Spodoptera litura Nrf2 protein expression. Experiments showed that the 3'UTR translation activity of S. litura Nrf2 was much higher than that of the 5'UTR. RNA interference (RNAi) of the expression of T cell internal antigen-related protein (TIAR), an RNA-binding protein that interacts with the 3'UTR of S. litura Nrf2, resulted in Nrf2 mRNA movement out of translationally active polysomes and a decrease in cellular Nrf2 protein levels. TIAR interacted with poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) and translation initiation factors eIF2-2 and eIF2-3 to enhance Nrf2 translation, indicating that the 3'UTR regulates Nrf2 translation. Diethyl maleate (DEM) treatment increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells and enhanced Nrf2 levels, which had been reduced by cycloheximide (CHX), an inhibitor of de novo protein synthesis; Tiar RNAi increased ROS levels in DEM-treated cells, suggesting TIAR-mediated 3'UTR involvement in Nrf2 translation in response to DEM treatment. Thus, we reveal a posttranscriptional regulation mechanism of Nrf2, in which TIAR binds with the Nrf2 mRNA 3'UTR to enhance Nrf2 translation, facilitating the increase in Nrf2 protein levels in response to oxidative stress.";polyalanine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
2571;31302192;A Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist ARNAX for therapeutic immunotherapy.;"Vaccine immunotherapy consisting of tumor antigens combined with an immune-enhancing adjuvant fosters cytotoxic T cell (CTL) proliferation. Clinically, polyI:C has been used as an adjuvant to enhance cancer vaccine protocols. However, according to its long history, polyI:C promotes inflammation that causes cytokine toxicity. Although checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy has improved the prognoses of patients with progressive cancer, over 75% of patients continue to experience resistance to antibody (Ab) against anti-programmed cell death-protein 1 (PD-1) or its ligand, PD-L1 therapy. In most cases, patients suffer from adverse events resulting from inflammation during anti-PD-1/L1 Ab therapy, which is a serious obstacle to patients' quality of life. We have studied the functional properties of double-stranded (ds)RNA and polyI:C, and developed a nucleic acid adjuvant that barely induces a significant increase in the level of serum inflammatory cytokines in mouse models. This adjuvant, termed ARNAX, consists of DNA-capped dsRNA that specifies the endosomal target for Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) in dendritic cells (DCs). We expect that this adjuvant is safe for administration in elderly patients with cancer receiving immunotherapy. Here, we summarize the properties of ARNAX for immunotherapy in mice. We suggest that DC-priming is essential to induce anti-tumor immunity; neither exogenous inflammation nor the administration of tumor antigens is always a prerequisite for DC-mediated CTL proliferation. If our mouse data can be extrapolated to humans, ARNAX and the liberated endogenous tumor antigens may facilitate effect of current therapies on patients with therapy-resistant tumors.

2573;3017718;Proteins from rat liver cytosol which stimulate mRNA transport. Purification and interactions with the nuclear envelope mRNA translocation system.;Two polysome-associated proteins with particular affinities for poly(A) have been purified from rat liver. These proteins stimulate the efflux of mRNA from isolated nuclei in conditions under which such efflux closely stimulates mRNA transport in vivo, and they are therefore considered as mRNA-transport-stimulatory proteins. Their interaction with the mRNA-translocation system in isolated nuclear envelopes has been studied. The results are generally consistent with the most recently proposed kinetic model of mRNA translocation. One protein, P58, has not been described previously. It inhibits the protein kinase that down-regulates the NTPase, it enhances the NTPase activity in both the presence and the absence of poly(A) and it seems to increase poly(A) binding in unphosphorylated, but not in phosphorylated, envelopes. The other protein, P31, which probably corresponds to the 35,000-Mr factor described by Webb and his colleagues, enhances the binding of poly(A) to the mRNA-binding site in the envelope, thus stimulating the phosphoprotein phosphatase and, in consequence, the NTPase. The possible physiological significance of these two proteins is discussed.; polyalanine ;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
2580;8451328;The effect of subjective and physiological arousal on dishabituation of salivation.;We have previously shown that salivation to the same food habituates, and recovers after presenting novel nontaste stimuli. This study assessed the effects of environmental stimuli that differentially influence subjective and autonomic arousal on dishabituation of salivation. Thirty female subjects were preloaded on a lemon yogurt milkshake and habituated to seven presentations of lemon juice. Prior to the eighth presentation of juice, subjects were presented an engaging video game designed to produce subjective but no autonomic arousal (LO), a video game plus mental arithmetic stressor, designed to produce both subjective and physiological arousal (HI), or a no stimuli (REST) control. Significant dishabituating effects of HI versus REST were shown for salivation. Heart rate was significantly higher during the dishabituator for HI than LO or REST conditions, which were equal. Finally, significant differences in arousal were shown between each of the three conditions. These results show salivation can be differentially dishabituated by nonfood stimuli, and these stimuli influence salivation without influencing subjective hunger or hedonics.;-;-;-;hard_0
2587;9777576;Diurnal variation of plasma cortisol levels in infancy.;Normal children and adults show diurnal variation of plasma cortisol levels reaching peak values around 08.00 h and lower values around 24.00 h. Despite numerous studies on diurnal variation of plasma cortisol levels in children, the age of appearance of a circadian rhythm has not been definitely established. The purpose of this study was to investigate the development of cortisol circadian rhythm in infancy. In seventy healthy, full-term infants, less than six months old, plasma cortisol was measured at 10.30 h and 22.30 h. The mean +/- SEM values of daytime plasma cortisol at one to four weeks of life were 159 +/- 41, 116 +/- 43, 240 +/- 54 and 456 +/- 95 nmol/l and the night-time values were 129 +/- 40, 99 +/- 44, 131 +/- 78 and 430 +/- 105 nmol/l, respectively. No statistically significant differences were found between daytime and night-time cortisol values during the first four weeks of life. In contrast, the daytime values of plasma cortisol were 295 +/- 62 at the age of 2-3 months, 211 +/- 43 at 4-5 months and 291 +/- 31 nmol/l at 6 months of life, and night-time values were 166 +/- 52, 119 +/- 35 and 109 +/- 21 nmol/l, respectively, which were statistically significant (p < 0.05).

In contrast, the hypertensive episodes were associated with marked tachycardia, sweating, anxiety, abdominal pain, and very high levels of plasma norepinephrine concentration. Extensive investigations failed to support a diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. The testing of baroreceptor function and autonomic reflexes was normal. Blood pressure was not salt sensitive.

2594;2710126;Structural organization of upstream exons and distribution of transcription start sites in the chicken c-myb gene.;We mapped and sequenced three upstream exons of the chicken c-myb gene and the regions flanking the first coding exon. We found multiple potential binding sites for transcription factors in the 5'-noncoding region, a T-rich stretch of 78 base pairs (bp) (68% T) in the first intron, and four fairly long open reading frames in the antisense direction of the first coding exon and its flanking regions. Three major transcription start sites, contained within a single 11-bp region, were identified by S1 nuclease analysis and primer extension. A sequence comparison of the avian and murine c-myb genes revealed a highly conserved sequence of 124 bp in the 5'-noncoding region. Its location between the putative transcription factor binding sites and the major transcription start sites suggests that it may play an important regulatory role in c-myb expression.;polythreonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

We have generated a panel of monoclonal and affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies directed against various epitopes of NF-Y. These reagents are highly specific for either of the A or B subunits; we have mapped the epitopes recognized by the monoclonal antibodies to the glutamine-rich activation domain of NF-YA. The antibodies inhibit in vitro transcription from the promoters of the albumin gene and of Ea, a class II gene of the major histocompatibility complex. These data definitively demonstrate the role of NF-Y in regulating the transcription of two tissue-specific genes whose expression patterns do not overlap.

We have carried out a detailed site-directed mutagenesis analysis of rat spermatidal protein TP2 to delineate the amino acid residues involved in coordination with two atoms of zinc. Two zinc fingers modules have been identified involving 4 histidine and 4 cysteine residues, respectively. The modular structure of the two zinc fingers identified in TP2 define a new class of zinc finger proteins that do not fall into any of the known classes of zinc fingers. Transfection experiments with COS-7 cells using wild type and the two zinc finger pocket mutants have shown that TP2 preferentially localizes to nucleolus.

2602;20410270;Three arginine residues within the RGG box are crucial for ICP27 binding to herpes simplex virus 1 GC-rich sequences and for efficient viral RNA export.;ICP27 is a multifunctional protein that is required for herpes simplex virus 1 mRNA export. ICP27 interacts with the mRNA export receptor TAP/NXF1 and binds RNA through an RGG box motif. Unlike other RGG box proteins, ICP27 does not bind G-quartet structures but instead binds GC-rich sequences that are flexible in structure. To determine the contribution of arginines within the RGG box, we performed in vitro binding assays with N-terminal proteins encoding amino acids 1 to 160 of wild-type ICP27 or arginine-to-lysine substitution mutants. The R138,148,150K triple mutant bound weakly to sequences that were bound by the wild-type protein and single and double mutants. Furthermore, during infection with the R138,148,150K mutant, poly(A)(+) RNA and newly transcribed RNA accumulated in the nucleus, indicating that viral RNA export was impaired. To determine if structural changes had occurred, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis was performed on N-terminal proteins consisting of amino acids 1 to 160 from wild-type ICP27 and the R138,148,150K mutant. This region of ICP27 was found to be highly flexible, and there were no apparent differences in the spectra seen with wild-type ICP27 and the R138,148,150K mutant. Furthermore, NMR analysis with the wild-type protein bound to GC-rich sequences did not show any discernible folding. We conclude that arginines at positions 138, 148, and 150 within the RGG box of ICP27 are required for binding to GC-rich sequences and that the N-terminal portion of ICP27 is highly flexible in structure, which may account for its preference for binding flexible sequences. ;polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

However, the greatest discriminative power was given by the y-axis (0 Hz) intercept of the spectral slope: LFT/DFT (p = 0.001); LFT/CA (p = 0.0001); and DFT/CA (p = 0.089).";-;-;-;hard_0
2604;6392325;Reverse-flow apparatus for enhanced colorimetric detection of bacteriuria.;The reverse-flow apparatus is a new device for enhancing the detection of bacteria in urine. Bacteria are trapped onto a customized filter, and the pigments, crystals, and other interfering substances in the urine pass through the filter and are discarded. The bacteria are backflushed and are recovered as a concentrate, and the concentrate is then processed through the previously described colorimetric bacteriuria detection device. A total of 1,000 urine samples were obtained from randomly selected patients and were cultured on agar. Upon enumeration of the colonies, 160 urine samples were shown to contain more than 10(5) CFU/ml. In the bacteriuria detection device, 150 urine samples could not be processed (pigmenters and cloggers), and of the 850 urine samples processed, 127 were culture positive for 10(5) CFU/ml or greater, and 150 urine samples contained between 10(4) and 10(5) CFU/ml. At 10(5) CFU/ml, there were 140 false-positives and 14 false-negatives. When duplicate urine samples were processed through and concentrated by our new reverse-flow apparatus, all samples, including the above pigmenters and cloggers, could be tested in the bacteriuria detection device. The 150 unprocessable samples described above yielded 33 additional bacteria-positive urines, 23 at the 10(5)-CFU/ml cutoff and 10 at the 10(4)-to-10(5)-CFU/ml cutoff. There were 105 false-positives at 10(5) CFU/ml and only 2 false-negatives at the same level of bacteria. At 10(4) to 10(5) CFU/ml there was only 1% false-positive and 4% false-negative.

2605;26416626;Stall no more at polyproline stretches with the translation elongation factors EF-P and IF-5A.;Synthesis of polyproline proteins leads to translation arrest. To overcome this ribosome stalling effect, bacteria depend on a specialized translation elongation factor P (EF-P), being orthologous and functionally identical to eukaryotic/archaeal elongation factor e/aIF-5A (recently renamed 'EF5'). EF-P binds to the stalled ribosome between the peptidyl-tRNA binding and tRNA-exiting sites, and stimulates peptidyl-transferase activity, thus allowing translation to resume. In their active form, both EF-P and e/aIF-5A are post-translationally modified at a positively charged residue, which protrudes toward the peptidyl-transferase center when bound to the ribosome. While archaeal and eukaryotic IF-5A strictly depend on (deoxy-) hypusination (hypusinylation) of a conserved lysine, bacteria have evolved diverse analogous modification strategies to activate EF-P. In Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica a lysine is extended by β-lysinylation and subsequently hydroxylated, whereas in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Shewanella oneidensis an arginine in the equivalent position is rhamnosylated. Inactivation of EF-P, or the corresponding modification systems, reduces not only bacterial fitness, but also impairs virulence. Here, we review the function of EF-P and IF-5A and their unusual posttranslational protein modifications.  ;polyproline;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
2606;8114718;A novel DNA-binding motif in the nuclear matrix attachment DNA-binding protein SATB1.;The nuclear matrix attachment DNA (MAR) binding protein SATB1 is a sequence context-specific binding protein that binds in the minor groove, making virtually no contact with the DNA bases. The SATB1 binding sites consist of a special AT-rich sequence context in which one strand is well-mixed A's, T's, and C's, excluding G's (ATC sequences), which is typically found in clusters within different MARs. To determine the extent of conservation of the SATB1 gene among different species, we cloned a mouse homolog of the human STAB1 cDNA from a cDNA expression library of the mouse thymus, the tissue in which this protein is predominantly expressed. This mouse cDNA encodes a 764-amino-acid protein with a 98% homology in amino acid sequence to the human SATB1 originally cloned from testis. To characterize the DNA binding domain of this novel class of protein, we used the mouse SATB1 cDNA and delineated a 150-amino-acid polypeptide as the binding domain. This region confers full DNA binding activity, recognizes the specific sequence context, and makes direct contact with DNA at the same nucleotides as the whole protein. This DNA binding domain contains a novel DNA binding motif: when no more than 21 amino acids at either the N- or C-terminal end of the binding domain are deleted, the majority of the DNA binding activity is lost. The concomitant presence of both terminal sequences is mandatory for binding. These two terminal regions consist of hydrophilic amino acids and share homologous sequences that are different from those of any known DNA binding motifs. We propose that the DNA binding region of SATB1 extends its two terminal regions toward DNA to make direct contact with DNA.;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
2607;8447244;Effect of lithium dosing schedule on urinary output.;Lithium has been reported to induce polyuria in up to 35% of patients receiving it. It has been suggested that polyuria may be reduced by using single rather than multiple daily dosing. However, this information is based on non-randomized studies, which used higher serum lithium levels than are currently used. In fact, the incidence of polyuria may be lower at currently used lithium levels, and the benefits of a single daily dose regimen on urine volume at these levels have not been assessed. We conducted a prospective randomized study to test the hypothesis that switching patients from multiple daily dose lithium to single daily dose lithium would significantly lower urine volume. Twenty-four patients previously stabilized on multiple daily dosing were randomly allocated to either single or multiple daily dose lithium. Twenty-four-hour urine volume, serum creatinine, creatinine clearance and serum lithium were measured at study entry and completion. Switching to single daily dose lithium did not significantly reduce the 24-h urine volume.;-;-;-;hard_0

H1 histones bound to DNA showed reversible and potent inhibition of receptor-DNA binding without affecting receptor hormone binding. Poly-lysine, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin and cytochrome c did not alter receptor-DNA binding. H1 histone subfractions (calf thymus lysine-rich histone (CTL)-1, CTL-2 and CTL-3) showed potent inhibition of receptor-DNA binding indistinguishable from each other. The quantity of H1 histone subfractions bound to DNA was the same. Although each subfraction has different functional properties, inhibition of receptor-DNA binding was a common feature of all the H1 histone subfractions, which is important for the non-random distribution of the receptor in chromatin. Binding of the receptor to core histones was investigated; it was found to bind to core histones more potently than to other proteins (H1 histone, ovalbumin and cytochrome c). Among core histone subfractions, H4 histone bound to the receptor most potently and is the candidate to be one of the acceptor sites of the receptor in chromatin.

To determine what effect ICP27 had on splicing proteins that might cause their redistribution, we looked at proteins that were immunoprecipitated with anti-Sm antisera. No significant changes were seen in the migration or amounts of several snRNP common and snRNP-specific proteins from infected cells labeled with [35S]methionine, suggesting that the synthesis of these proteins was not altered by viral infection. However, when cells were labeled with 32Pi, differences were seen in the phosphorylation of at least two proteins depending on whether ICP27 was expressed. One protein, which had an apparent molecular mass of about 85 kDa, was highly phosphorylated during wild-type HSV-1 infection but much less so during infection with an ICP27 null mutant. The other protein, which migrated at the position of the U1 70-kDa protein and was precipitated with U1-specific antiserum, was also more highly phosphorylated when ICP27 was expressed during infection. Furthermore, a phosphoprotein with an apparent molecular mass of 63 kDa was found to coimmunoprecipitate with anti-Sm antisera during wild-type HSV-1 infection. ICP27 has an apparent molecular mass of 63 kDa, and immunoblot analysis confirmed that ICP27 coimmunoprecipitated with snRNPs. Analysis of mutations throughout the ICP27 protein demonstrated that the region that was required for this interaction was the C terminus of the protein, which includes a cysteine-histidine-rich region that resembles a zinc-finger-like motif. These data suggest that ICP27 interacts with snRNPs during infection and that it fosters changes in the phosphorylation state of at least two proteins that immunoprecipitate with snRNPs, although these studies do not demonstrate whether it does so directly or indirectly.;polyhistidine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
2621;1460426;Generation of large numbers of dendritic cells from mouse bone marrow cultures supplemented with granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor.;"Antigen-presenting, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-rich dendritic cells are known to arise from bone marrow. However, marrow lacks mature dendritic cells, and substantial numbers of proliferating less-mature cells have yet to be identified. The methodology for inducing dendritic cell growth that was recently described for mouse blood now has been modified to MHC class II-negative precursors in marrow. A key step is to remove the majority of nonadherent, newly formed granulocytes by gentle washes during the first 2-4 d of culture. This leaves behind proliferating clusters that are loosely attached to a more firmly adherent ""stroma."" At days 4-6 the clusters can be dislodged, isolated by 1-g sedimentation, and upon reculture, large numbers of dendritic cells are released. The latter are readily identified on the basis of their distinct cell shape, ultrastructure, and repertoire of antigens, as detected with a panel of monoclonal antibodies. The dendritic cells express high levels of MHC class II products and act as powerful accessory cells for initiating the mixed leukocyte reaction. Neither the clusters nor mature dendritic cells are generated if macrophage colony-stimulating factor rather than granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is applied. Therefore, GM-CSF generates all three lineages of myeloid cells (granulocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells). Since > 5 x 10(6) dendritic cells develop in 1 wk from precursors within the large hind limb bones of a single animal, marrow progenitors can act as a major source of dendritic cells. This feature should prove useful for future molecular and clinical studies of this otherwise trace cell type.";polyisoleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

The protrusion enlarged as the gamont cytoplasm and nucleus moved into the protruded area. During movement, macrogamonts had an elongate shape. The body of the gamont was constricted as it moved through the cell cytoplasm or from one cell to an adjacent one. After movement had ceased, the gamont resumed its ovoid or spheroidal shape.;-;-;-;hard_0
2628;10391930;Interplay of C1 and C2 domains of protein kinase C-alpha in its membrane binding and activation.;The regulatory domain of conventional protein kinase C (PKC) contains two membrane-targeting modules, the C2 domain that is responsible for Ca2+-dependent membrane binding of protein, and the C1 domain composed of two cysteine-rich zinc fingers (C1a and C1b) that bind diacylglycerols and phorbol esters. To understand the individual roles and the interplay of the C1 and C2 domains in the membrane binding and activation of PKC, we functionally expressed isolated C1 and C2 domains of PKC-alpha and measured their vesicle binding and monolayer penetration. Results indicate that the C2 domain of PKC-alpha is responsible for the initial Ca2+- and phosphatidylserine-dependent electrostatic membrane binding of PKC-alpha, whereas the C1 domain is involved in subsequent membrane penetration and diacylglycerol binding, which eventually lead to enzyme activation. To determine the roles of individual zinc fingers in the C1 domain, we also mutated hydrophobic residues in the C1a (Trp58 and Phe60) and C1b (Tyr123 and Leu125) domains of the native PKC-alpha molecule and measured the effects of mutations on vesicle binding, enzyme activity and monolayer penetration. Results show that the hydrophobic residues in the C1a domain are essential for the membrane penetration and activation of PKC-alpha, whereas those in the C1b domain are not directly involved in these processes. Based on these results in conjunction with our previous structure-function studies of the C2 domain (Medkova, M., and Cho, W. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 17544-17552), we propose a mechanism for the in vitro membrane binding and activation of conventional PKC that accounts for the temporal and spatial sequences of PKC activation. ;polycysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
2633;12672521;Diversity and natural selection in Plasmodium vivax Duffy binding protein gene.;The Plasmodium vivax Duffy binding protein (DBP) binds to the Duffy blood group antigen on the surface of erythrocytes and is essential for invasion. Natural immunity develops to this protein making it an important vaccine candidate. Genetic diversity within and between populations was compared in 100 dbp sequences from isolates obtained from Papua New Guinea, Colombia, and South Korea. The cysteine-rich region II, that contains the binding domain, has the highest diversity compared to the rest of the dbp gene and appears to be under strong selective pressure based on statistical tests comparing rates of non-synonymous (K(n)) to synonymous mutations (K(s)) among P. vivax isolates and to those of closely related species. By contrast, meiotic recombination was not found to be significant for maintaining genetic diversity. A comparison of the patterns of nucleotide diversity within dbpII to that of genes encoding homologous erythrocyte binding proteins of Plasmodium knowlesi predict critical binding residues juxtaposed to polymorphic B- and T-cell epitopes. Phylogenic analysis and measurement of nucleotide diversity between and within the different geographic populations support emergence of distinct allelic families suggestive of divergent selection of alleles between populations. Development of a P. vivax DBP-based vaccine must take into account regions of high diversity within the molecule and alleles that show distinct geographic differences. ;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

However, simultaneous medial and lateral fractures occurring in the same clavicle (the so-called 'bipolar clavicle fracture') are rare. Treatment for this type of fracture is not well established. Herein, we report our experience of the operative management of a bipolar clavicle fracture using two anatomical locking plates. The patient was an 82-year-old woman who presented with left-sided clavicle pain after falling to the ground. Plain radiography revealed midshaft and distal clavicular fractures. Open reduction and internal fixation were performed using two different plates, the VA-LCP anterior clavicle plate (DePuy Synthes, West Chester, PA, USA) for the midshaft fracture and the LCP superior anterior clavicle plate with lateral extension (DePuy Synthes) for the distal clavicle fracture. Bony union was achieved 4 months postoperatively without any complications. In conclusion, dual plating is an effective surgical procedure for treating bipolar clavicle fractures.;-;-;-;hard_0

Here, we describe a method, poly(A) binding protein-mediated mRNA 3' end retrieval by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (PAPERCLIP), that shows high specificity for mRNA 3' ends and compares favorably with existing 3' end mapping methods. PAPERCLIP uncovers a previously unrecognized role of CstF64/64tau in promoting the usage of a selected group of non-canonical poly(A) sites, the majority of which contain a downstream GUKKU motif. Furthermore, in the mouse brain, PAPERCLIP discovers extended 3' UTR sequences harboring functional miRNA binding sites and reveals developmentally regulated APA shifts, including one in Atp2b2 that is evolutionarily conserved in humans and results in the gain of a functional binding site of miR-137.

2658;8126797;Suppression of renal scarring by prednisolone combined with ciprofloxacin in ascending pyelonephritis in rats.;To prevent renal scarring, which occurs at the end stage of chronic pyelonephritis due to vesicoureteral reflux of infected urine, immediate antimicrobial treatment is reported to be essential. When treatment is delayed, the antimicrobial agent is believed to be effective only in eliminating bacteria, not in preventing scar formation. Using the ascending pyelonephritis model in rats, we investigated the effect of immediate or delayed treatment with ciprofloxacin and that of delayed treatment with a combination of ciprofloxacin and prednisolone in preventing renal scarring following infection. An inoculum of 1 x 10(9) colony forming units (cfu)/0.1 ml. of the HM32 strain of Escherichia coli, which was isolated from a patient with a urinary tract infection, was injected directly into the rat bladder, and the urethra was clamped for 4 hours in each rat. Treatment by ciprofloxacin (15 mg./kg., twice a day for 5 days) alone or in combination with prednisolone (2 mg./kg., once a day for 4 days) was initiated 6 or 72 hours after bacterial inoculation. The kidneys of each rat were examined 6 weeks later. Immediate treatment by ciprofloxacin significantly inhibited renal scarring (no scarring was seen in any of the 8 rats), but delayed treatment had no effect on scarring (4 of 8 rats showed scarring) when compared with the untreated controls (7 of 8 rats showed scarring). However, the addition of prednisolone to the delayed treatment with ciprofloxacin significantly inhibited renal scarring (only 1 of 10 rats showed scarring) when compared with the untreated controls (7 of 8 rats showed scarring). These data suggest that prednisolone is effective in preventing renal scarring which occurs due to vesicoureteral reflux when the initiation of antimicrobial treatment is delayed.;-;-;-;hard_0
2661;20855539;TbRGG2 facilitates kinetoplastid RNA editing initiation and progression past intrinsic pause sites.;TbRGG2 is an essential kinetoplastid RNA editing accessory factor that acts specifically on pan-edited RNAs. To understand the mechanism of TbRGG2 action, we undertook an in-depth analysis of edited RNA populations in TbRGG2 knockdown cells and an in vitro examination of the biochemical activities of the protein. We demonstrate that TbRGG2 down-regulation more severely impacts editing at the 5' ends of pan-edited RNAs than at their 3' ends. The initiation of editing is reduced to some extent in TbRGG2 knockdown cells. In addition, TbRGG2 plays a post-initiation role as editing becomes stalled in TbRGG2-depleted cells, resulting in an overall decrease in the 3' to 5' progression of editing. Detailed analyses of edited RNAs from wild-type and TbRGG2-depleted cells reveal that TbRGG2 facilitates progression of editing past intrinsic pause sites that often correspond to the 3' ends of cognate guide RNAs (gRNAs). In addition, noncanonically edited junction regions are either absent or significantly shortened in TbRGG2-depleted cells, consistent with impaired gRNA transitions. Sequence analysis further suggests that TbRGG2 facilitates complete utilization of certain gRNAs. In vitro RNA annealing and in vivo RNA unwinding assays demonstrate that TbRGG2 can modulate RNA-RNA interactions. Collectively, these data are consistent with a model in which TbRGG2 facilitates initiation and 3' to 5' progression of editing through its ability to affect gRNA utilization, both during the transition between specific gRNAs and during usage of certain gRNAs.;-;-;-;hard_0
2662;18028296;Comparative transcriptome profiling of near-isogenic barley (Hordeum vulgare) lines differing in the allelic state of a major grain protein content locus identifies genes with possible roles in leaf senescence and nitrogen reallocation.;To identify genes involved in the regulation and execution of leaf senescence and whole-plant nitrogen reallocation, near-isogenic barley germplasm divergent in senescence timing and protein concentration of mature grains was contrasted. Barley lines differing in allelic state at a major locus on chromosome six, controlling grain protein concentration, were obtained after four generations of backcrossing. Based on physiological data indicating major differences between low- and high-grain protein germplasm at 14-21 d past anthesis, the flag leaf and kernel transcriptomes of the low-protein parent and one high-protein near-isogenic line were compared at these time points, using the 22-k Barley1 Affymetrix microarray. Our data associate several genes with both known (based on sequence comparisons) and unknown functions with the senescence process. These include leucine-rich repeat transmembrane protein kinases, a glycine-rich RNA-binding protein with homology to AtGRP7 and a 'mother of FT/TF1' gene. Our data also indicate upregulation of genes coding for both plastidial and extraplastidial proteases in germplasm with accelerated leaf senescence. Functional characterization of candidate genes identified by this research may contribute to our understanding of the molecular network underlying leaf senescence and nitrogen reallocation. ;polyleucine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Characterization and binding to linear and four-way junction DNA.;A chromosomal high mobility group (HMG) protein from an epithelial cell line of Chironomus tentans (Diptera) was purified to homogeneity and chemically characterized. cDNA clones encoding this protein were isolated and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed a high similarity to HMG protein I of mammalia. This insect protein has therefore been designated cHMGI. It has a deduced molecular mass of 10,371 kDa and appears to be a product of a single gene copy. Similarly to mammalian HMGI/Y proteins the insect cHMGI protein has three putative DNA-binding motifs with a sequence K/RXRGRP that are each encoded by one exon of the gene. Using synthetic peptides we have shown that the first and the second motif are necessary for high-affinity binding of the protein to DNA. Protein cHMGI binds preferentially to AT-rich DNA with a half-saturation value of 1.1 nM. Both cHMGI and human HMGI proteins recognize specifically a four-way junction DNA. We have also purified a related protein with similar physico-chemical properties from Drosophila melanogaster Kc cells. The identification and characterization of HMGI proteins in insects with polytene chromosomes and with the cytologic and genetic potential of Chironomus and Drosophila opens new possibilities for studying function(s) of this group of chromosomal proteins. ;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
2668;15570058;Tomato phytochemicals and prostate cancer risk.;Mounting evidence over the past decade suggests that the consumption of fresh and processed tomato products is associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer. The emerging hypothesis is that lycopene, the primary red carotenoid in tomatoes, may be the principle phytochemical responsible for this reduction in risk. A number of potential mechanisms by which lycopene may act have emerged, including serving as an important in vivo antioxidant, enhancing cell-to-cell communication via increasing gap junctions between cells, and modulating cell-cycle progression. Although the effect of lycopene is biologically relevant, the tomato is also an excellent source of nutrients, including folate, vitamin C, and various other carotenoids and phytochemicals, such as polyphenols, which also may be associated with lower cancer risk. Tomatoes also contain significant quantities of potassium, as well as some vitamin A and vitamin E. Our laboratory has been interested in identifying specific components or combination of components in tomatoes that are responsible for reducing prostate cancer risk. We carried out cell culture trials to evaluate the effects of tomato carotenoids and tomato polyphenols on growth of prostate cancer cells. We also evaluated the ability of freeze-dried whole-tomato powder or lycopene alone to reduce growth of prostate tumors in rats. This paper reviews the epidemiological evidence, evaluating the relationship between prostate cancer risk and tomato consumption, and presents experimental data from this and other laboratories that support the hypothesis that whole tomato and its phytochemical components reduce the risk of prostate cancer.;-;-;-;hard_0

Decorin, an archetypical small leucine-rich proteoglycan, initiates a protracted autophagic program downstream of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) signaling that requires paternally expressed gene 3 (PEG3). We have discovered that PEG3 is an upstream transcriptional regulator of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master transcription factor of lysosomal biogenesis, for decorin-evoked endothelial cell autophagy. We found a functional requirement of PEG3 for TFEB transcriptional induction and nuclear translocation in human umbilical vein endothelial and PAER2 cells. Mechanistically, inhibiting VEGFR2 or AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a major decorin-activated energy sensor kinase, prevented decorin-evoked TFEB induction and nuclear localization. In conclusion, our findings indicate a non-canonical (nutrient- and energy-independent) mechanism underlying the pro-autophagic bioactivity of decorin via PEG3 and TFEB. ;polyleucine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
2675;9398672;Gene conversion of major histocompatibility complex genes in the mouse spermatogenesis is a premeiotic event.;The molecular genetic mechanism of gene conversion in higher eukaryotes remains unknown. We find it of considerable interest to determine when during spermatogenesis gene conversion occurs. We have therefore purified pachytene spermatocytes and haploid spermatocytes from adult mice and analyzed these fractions for the presence of gene conversion products resulting from the transfer between the major histocompatibility complex class II genes Ebd and Abk in a polymerase chain reaction assay. We have further isolated spermatogenic cells from prepubescent mice and analyzed them for the presence of the same gene conversion products. We can detect gene conversion products in testis cells as early as in 8-d-old mice where the only existing spermatogenic cells are spermatogonia. The frequency of gene conversion products remains the same as the cells reach meiosis in 18-d-old mice, and is unchanged after meiosis is completed in haploid spermatocytes. Gene conversion of this specific fragment therefore appears to be a premeiotic event and, consequently, relies on genetic mechanisms other than normal meiotic recombination.;-;-;-;hard_0

During maintained G protein activation and in the presence of high external K+ (VK = 0 mV), voltage jumps from VK to negative membrane potentials activated inward GIRK1 K+ currents with three distinct time-resolved current components. GIRK1 current activation consisted of an instantaneous component that was followed by two components with time constants tau f approximately 50 ms and tau s approximately 400 ms. These activation time constants were weakly voltage dependent, increasing approximately twofold with maximal hyperpolarization from VK. Voltage-dependent GIRK1 availability, revealed by tail currents at -80 mV after long prepulses, was greatest at potentials negative to VK and declined to a plateau of approximately half the maximal level at positive voltages. Voltage-dependent GIRK1 availability shifted with VK and was half maximal at VK -20 mV; the equivalent gating charge was approximately 1.6 e-. The voltage-dependent gating parameters of GIRK1 did not significantly differ for G protein activation by three heterologously expressed signaling pathways: m2 muscarinic receptors, serotonin 1A receptors, or G protein beta 1 gamma 2 subunits. Voltage dependence was also unaffected by agonist concentration. These results indicate that the voltage-dependent gating properties of GIRK1 are not due to extrinsic factors such as agonist-receptor interactions and G protein-channel coupling, but instead are analogous to the intrinsic gating behaviors of other inwardly rectifying K+ channels.";-;-;-;hard_0
2677;8654905;Analog and digital filtering of ABR: ipsi- and contralateral derivations.;"OBJECTIVE
In audioneurological evaluations, peak latency is an important parameter regarding the determination of possible wave delays. Digital filtering entails suppression of less informative low-frequency components without phase distortion, thus accentuating the peak readings. Ipsi- and contralateral recordings have improved the reliability as regards the identification of ABR waves. This applies specifically to the wave IV-V complex. The purpose of this study has been to compare 1) analog and digitally filtered waveforms and 2) ipsi- and contralateral derivations.


DESIGN
Two-channel ABR data were collected from 120 unselected subjects referred for assessment of possible retrocochlear diseases. The analog filter bandwidth was 30 to 3000 Hz. Each response was subsequently digitally filtered with a bandwidth of 300 to 2500 Hz, and a comparison of wave identification between the analog and digitally filtered responses was performed. Wave identification was also compared between the digitally filtered ipsi- and contralateral responses, and the differences of the wave latencies between the two derivations were calculated.


RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Digital filtering improves ABR wave identification. For the digitally filtered waveforms, a better wave identification is found ipsilaterally for waves I to III, whereas the opposite is found for wave IV. Wave V identification is identical in both derivations. Furthermore, significant ipsi- and contralateral latency difference were found for all waves except for wave IV. This must be taken into consideration if ipsi- and contralateral derivations are to be summed.";-;-;-;hard_0

By using an oligonucleotide probe based on the partial N-terminal amino acid sequence of the Vibrio harveyi NADPH-FMN oxidoreductase (flavin reductase P), a recombinant plasmid, pFRP1, was obtained which contained the frp gene encoding this enzyme. The DNA sequence of the frp gene was determined; the deduced amino acid sequence for flavin reductase P consists of 240 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 26,312. The frp gene was overexpressed, apparently through induction, in Escherichia coli JM109 cells harboring pFRP1. The cloned flavin reductase P was purified to homogeneity by following a new and simple procedure involving FMN-agarose chromatography as a key step. The same chromatography material was also highly effective in concentrating diluted flavin reductase P. The purified enzyme is a monomer and is unusual in having a tightly bound FMN cofactor. Distinct from the free FMN, the bound FMN cofactor showed a diminished A375 peak and a slightly increased 8-nm red-shifted A453 peak and was completely or nearly nonfluorescent.

2682;19918215;Developmental biology of the innate immune response: implications for neonatal and infant vaccine development.;Molecular characterization of mechanisms by which human pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) detect danger signals has greatly expanded our understanding of the innate immune system. PRRs include Toll-like receptors, nucleotide oligomerization domain-like receptors, retinoic acid inducible gene-like receptors, and C-type lectin receptors. Characterization of the developmental expression of these systems in the fetus, newborn, and infant is incomplete but has yielded important insights into neonatal susceptibility to infection. Activation of PRRs on antigen-presenting cells enhances costimulatory function, and thus PRR agonists are potential vaccine adjuvants, some of which are already in clinical use. Thus, study of PRRs has also revealed how previously mysterious immunomodulators are able to mediate their actions, including the vaccine adjuvant aluminum hydroxide that activates a cytosolic protein complex known as the Nacht domain leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 inflammasome leading to interleukin-1beta production. Progress in characterizing PRRs is thus informing and expanding the design of improved adjuvants. This review summarizes recent developments in the field of innate immunity emphasizing developmental expression in the fetus, newborn, and infant and its implications for the design of more effective neonatal and infant vaccines. ;polyleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

In the mesencephalon, expression is seen as a band across the most anterior portion. There is also diencephalon expression in the anlagen of the thalamus and the hypothalamus as well as in the optic stalk, optic recess, and the ganglionic eminence. Moreover, through the use of fusion proteins containing the Gsh-1 homeodomain, we have determined the consensus DNA binding site of the Gsh-1 homeoprotein to be GCT/CA/CATTAG/A.; polyalanine ;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
2694;23672230;OakContigDF159.1, a reference library for studying differential gene expression in Quercus robur during controlled biotic interactions: use for quantitative transcriptomic profiling of oak roots in ectomycorrhizal symbiosis.;Oaks (Quercus spp.), which are major forest trees in the northern hemisphere, host many biotic interactions, but molecular investigation of these interactions is limited by fragmentary genome data. To date, only 75 oak expressed sequence tags (ESTs) have been characterized in ectomycorrhizal (EM) symbioses. We synthesized seven beneficial and detrimental biotic interactions between microorganisms and animals and a clone (DF159) of Quercus robur. Sixteen 454 and eight Illumina cDNA libraries from leaves and roots were prepared and merged to establish a reference for RNA-Seq transcriptomic analysis of oak EMs with Piloderma croceum. Using the Mimicking Intelligent Read Assembly (MIRA) and Trinity assembler, the OakContigDF159.1 hybrid assembly, containing 65 712 contigs with a mean length of 1003 bp, was constructed, giving broad coverage of metabolic pathways. This allowed us to identify 3018 oak contigs that were differentially expressed in EMs, with genes encoding proline-rich cell wall proteins and ethylene signalling-related transcription factors showing up-regulation while auxin and defence-related genes were down-regulated. In addition to the first report of remorin expression in EMs, the extensive coverage provided by the study permitted detection of differential regulation within large gene families (nitrogen, phosphorus and sugar transporters, aquaporins). This might indicate specific mechanisms of genome regulation in oak EMs compared with other trees. ;polyproline;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
2695;27698795;Whole-exome sequencing identifies variants in invasive pituitary adenomas.;Pituitary adenomas exhibit a wide range of behaviors. The prediction of invasion or malignant behavior in pituitary adenomas remains challenging. The objective of the present study was to identify the genetic abnormalities associated with invasion in sporadic pituitary adenomas. In the present study, the exomes of six invasive pituitary adenomas (IPA) and six non-invasive pituitary adenomas (nIPA) were sequenced by whole-exome sequencing. Variants were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing, and candidate driver genes were assessed in an additional 28 pituitary adenomas. A total of 15 identified variants were mainly associated with angiogenesis, metabolism, cell cycle phase, cellular component organization, cytoskeleton and biogenesis immune at a cellular level, including 13 variants that occurred as single nucleotide variants and 2 that comprised of insertions. The messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of diffuse panbronchiolitis critical region 1 (DPCR1), KIAA0226, myxovirus (influenza virus) resistance, proline-rich protein BstNI subfamily 3, PR domain containing 2, with ZNF domain, RIZ1 (PRDM2), PR domain containing 8 (PRDM8), SPANX family member N2 (SPANXN2), TRIO and F-actin binding protein and zinc finger protein 717 in IPA specimens were 50% decreased compared with nIPA specimens. In particular, DPCR1, PRDM2, PRDM8 and SPANXN2 mRNA levels in IPA specimens were approximately four-fold lower compared with nIPA specimens (P=0.003, 0.007, 0.009 and 0.004, respectively). By contrast, the mRNA levels of dentin sialophospho protein, EGF like domain, multiple 7 (EGFL7), low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1B and dynein, axonemal, assembly factor 1 (LRRC50) were increased in IPA compared with nIPA specimens (P=0.041, 0.037, 0.022 and 0.013, respectively). Furthermore, decreased PRDM2 expression was associated with tumor recurrence. The findings of the present study indicate that DPCR1, EGFL7, the PRDM family and LRRC50 in pituitary adenomas are modifiers of tumorigenesis, and most likely contribute to the development of oncocytic change and to the invasive tumor phenotype. ;polyproline;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
2696;6202827;Antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) elicited by immunization with a synthetic peptide covalently linked to liposomes.;Peptides synthesized for potential application as antiviral vaccines have been mostly tested in the form of conjugates with carrier proteins. The possible use of several distinct synthetic vaccines in prophylaxis would be facilitated by the availability of fully synthetic immunogens. A synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 135 to 155 ( P135 -155) of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) failed to elicit in free form anti-peptide antibodies or anti-HBs. However, polymers of P135 -155 (prepared by linking to diaminoalkanes ) and synthetic conjugates prepared by binding P135 -155 to liposomes or polylysine were immunogenic. A poor correlation was observed between anti-peptide and anti-HBs responses elicited by these conjugates.

2697;26103097;New insights into the expression and functions of the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus long noncoding PAN RNA.;The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a clinically relevant pathogen associated with several human diseases that primarily affect immunocompromised individuals. KSHV encodes a noncoding polyadenylated nuclear (PAN) RNA that is essential for viral propagation and viral gene expression. PAN RNA is the most abundant viral transcript produced during lytic replication. The accumulation of PAN RNA depends on high levels of transcription driven by the Rta protein, a KSHV transcription factor necessary and sufficient for latent-to-lytic phase transition. In addition, KSHV uses several posttranscriptional mechanisms to stabilize PAN RNA. A cis-acting element, called the ENE, prevents PAN RNA decay by forming a triple helix with its poly(A) tail. The viral ORF57 and the cellular PABPC1 proteins further contribute to PAN RNA stability during lytic phase. PAN RNA functions are only beginning to be uncovered, but PAN RNA has been proposed to control gene expression by several different mechanisms. PAN RNA associates with the KSHV genome and may regulate gene expression by recruiting chromatin-modifying factors. Moreover, PAN RNA binds the viral latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) protein and decreases its repressive activity by sequestering it from the viral genome. Surprisingly, PAN RNA was found to associate with translating ribosomes, so this noncoding RNA may be additionally used to produce viral peptides. In this review, I highlight the mechanisms of PAN RNA accumulation and describe recent insights into potential functions of PAN RNA.  ;polyalanine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
2698;15144381;Involvement of MEK1 MAPKK, NTF6 MAPK, WRKY/MYB transcription factors, COI1 and CTR1 in N-mediated resistance to tobacco mosaic virus.;The tobacco N gene, a member of the Toll-interleukin 1 homology region/nucleotide binding site/leucine-rich repeat (TIR-NBS-LRR) class of resistance (R) genes, confers resistance to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). We used a candidate gene approach to identify known defense genes that were also involved in N signaling. The requirement for these genes was determined by downregulating their expression using the well-established tobacco rattle virus (TRV)-based virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS). Silencing of genes encoding a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) NTF6/NRK1, or an MAPK kinase (MAPKK) MEK1/NQK1, attenuated N-mediated resistance to TMV. We also found that N resistance is compromised in plants in which expression of WRKY1-WRKY3 and MYB1 transcription factors were downregulated. In addition, suppression of jasmonic acid (JA) signaling component COI1 ortholog affected N function. However, downregulation of expression of CTR1 ortholog leads to more rapid hypersensitive response (HR). The involvement of these genes in N- and other R-gene-mediated defense provides further evidence for the convergence of downstream signaling pathways of different R genes. ;polyleucine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
2700;9989818;Rapid dephosphorylation of p107 following UV irradiation.;In response to UV irradiation, mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts transiently arrest predominantly in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Here, we investigate the role of the retinoblastoma-related pocket proteins in this biological process. We report here that UV induces an increase in p107/E2F complexes, shown previously to be repressors of E2F-dependent transcriptional activity. Several lines of evidence indicate that the increase of p107/E2F complexes following UV irradiation is a consequence of rapid dephosphorylation of p107. First, UV-mediated p107 dephosphorylation could be abolished by pretreatment of NIH3T3 fibroblasts with the serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors calyculin A and okadaic acid. Second, alteration of protein phosphatase 2A holoenzyme composition by over-expression of specific B subunits interfered with UV-mediated dephosphorylation of p107. Consistent with this, p107 could be dephosphorylated in vitro with PP2A. Moreover, dephosphorylation of p107 was shown to be independent of the activity of p53 and p21, as it occurred also in UV-treated p53-null as well as p21-null mouse fibroblasts. We observed a close correlation between the UV dosages required for G1 cell cycle arrest and p107 dephosphorylation. Our data suggest a model in which UV radiation-induced cell cycle arrest depends, at least in part, on the induction of a PP2A-like phosphatase that acts on p107.;-;-;-;hard_0

2705;26429923;Sexual Selection of Protamine 1 in Mammals.;Protamines have a crucial role in male fertility. They are involved in sperm chromatin packaging and influence the shape of the sperm head and, hence, are important for sperm performance. Protamine structure is basic with numerous arginine-rich DNA-binding domains. Postcopulatory sexual selection is thought to play an important role in protamine sequence evolution and expression. Here, we analyze patterns of evolution and sexual selection (in the form of sperm competition) acting on protamine 1 gene sequence in 237 mammalian species. We assessed common patterns as well as differences between the major mammalian subclasses (Eutheria, Metatheria) and clades. We found that a high arginine content in protamine 1 associates with a lower sperm head width, which may have an impact on sperm swimming velocity. Increase in arginine content in protamine 1 across mammals appears to take place in a way consistent with sexual selection. In metatherians, increase in sequence length correlates with sexual selection. Differences in selective pressures on sequences and codon sites were observed between mammalian clades. Our study revealed a complex evolutionary pattern of protamine 1, with different selective constraints, and effects of sexual selection, between mammalian groups. In contrast, the effect of arginine content on head shape, and the possible involvement of sperm competition, was identified across all mammals.  ;polyarginine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
2708;1761037;The secondary structure of echistatin from 1H-NMR, circular-dichroism and Raman spectroscopy.;Detailed biophysical studies have been carried out on echistatin, a member of the disintegrin family of small, cysteine-rich, RGD-containing proteins, isolated from the venom of the saw-scaled viper Echis carinatus. Analysis of circular-dichroism spectra indicates that, at 20 degrees C, echistatin contains no alpha-helix but contains mostly beta-turns and beta-sheet. Two isobestic points are observed as the temperature is raised, the conformational changes associated with that observed between 40 degrees C and 72 degrees C being irreversible. Raman spectra also indicate considerable beta-turn and beta-sheet (20%) structure and an absence of alpha-helical structure. Three of the four disulphide bridges are shown to be in an all-gauche conformation, while the fourth adopts a trans-gauche-gauche conformation. The 1H-NMR spectrum of echistatin has been almost fully assigned. A single conformation was observed at 27 degrees C with the four proline residues adopting only the trans conformation. A large number of backbone amide protons were found to exchange slowly, but no segments of the backbone were found to be in either alpha-helical or beta-sheet conformation. A number of turns could be characterised. An irregular beta-hairpin contains the RGD sequence in a mobile loop at its tip. Two of the four disulphide cross-links have been identified from the NMR spectra. The data presented in this paper will serve to define the structure of echistatin more closely in subsequent studies.;polycysteine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
2710;9632785;RNA binding activity of heterodimeric splicing factor U2AF: at least one RS domain is required for high-affinity binding.;The pre-mRNA splicing factor U2AF (U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle [snRNP] auxiliary factor) plays a critical role in 3' splice site selection. U2AF binds site specifically to the intron pyrimidine tract between the branchpoint and the 3' splice site and targets U2 snRNP to the branch site at an early step in spliceosome assembly. Human U2AF is a heterodimer composed of large (hU2AF65) and small (hU2AF35) subunits. hU2AF65 contains an arginine-serine-rich (RS) domain and three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs). hU2AF35 has a degenerate RRM and a carboxyl-terminal RS domain. Genetic studies have recently shown that the RS domains on the Drosophila U2AF subunit homologs are each inessential and might have redundant functions in vivo. The site-specific pyrimidine tract binding activity of the U2AF heterodimer has previously been assigned to hU2AF65. While the requirement for the three RRMs on hU2AF65 is firmly established, a role for the large-subunit RS domain in RNA binding remains unresolved. We have analyzed the RNA binding activity of the U2AF heterodimer in vitro. When the Drosophila small-subunit homolog (dU2AF38) was complexed with the large-subunit (dU2AF50) pyrimidine tract, RNA binding activity increased 20-fold over that of free dU2AF50. We detected a similar increase in RNA binding activity when we compared the human U2AF heterodimer and hU2AF65. Surprisingly, the RS domain on dU2AF38 was necessary for the increased binding activity of the dU2AF heterodimer. In addition, removal of the RS domain from the Drosophila large-subunit monomer (dU2AF50DeltaRS) severely impaired its binding activity. However, if the dU2AF38 RS domain was supplied in a complex with dU2AF50DeltaRS, high-affinity binding was restored. These results suggest that the presence of one RS domain of U2AF, on either the large or small subunit, promotes high-affinity pyrimidine tract RNA binding activity, consistent with redundant roles for the U2AF RS domains in vivo.;polyserine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

2722;34031189;Cysteine Modification by Ebselen Reduces the Stability and Cellular Levels of 14-3-3 Proteins.;The 14-3-3 proteins constitute a family of adaptor proteins with many binding partners and biological functions, and they are considered promising drug targets in cancer and neuropsychiatry. By screening 1280 small-molecule drugs using differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF), we found 15 compounds that decreased the thermal stability of 14-3-3ζ Among these compounds, ebselen was identified as a covalent, destabilizing ligand of 14-3-3 isoforms ζ, ε, γ, and η Ebselen bonding decreased 14-3-3ζ binding to its partner Ser19-phosphorylated tyrosine hydroxylase. Characterization of site-directed mutants at cysteine residues in 14-3-3ζ (C25, C94, and C189) by DSF and mass spectroscopy revealed covalent modification by ebselen of all cysteines through a selenylsulfide bond. C25 appeared to be the preferential site of ebselen interaction in vitro, whereas modification of C94 was the main determinant for protein destabilization. At therapeutically relevant concentrations, ebselen and ebselen oxide caused decreased 14-3-3 levels in SH-SY5Y cells, accompanied with an increased degradation, most probably by the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway. Moreover, ebselen-treated zebrafish displayed decreased brain 14-3-3 content, a freezing phenotype, and reduced mobility, resembling the effects of lithium, consistent with its proposed action as a safer lithium-mimetic drug. Ebselen has recently emerged as a promising drug candidate in several medical areas, such as cancer, neuropsychiatric disorders, and infectious diseases, including coronavirus disease 2019. Its pleiotropic actions are attributed to antioxidant effects and formation of selenosulfides with critical cysteine residues in proteins. Our work indicates that a destabilization of 14-3-3 may affect the protein interaction networks of this protein family, contributing to the therapeutic potential of ebselen. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: There is currently great interest in the repurposing of established drugs for new indications and therapeutic targets. This study shows that ebselen, which is a promising drug candidate against cancer, bipolar disorder, and the viral infection coronavirus disease 2019, covalently bonds to cysteine residues in 14-3-3 adaptor proteins, triggering destabilization and increased degradation in cells and intact brain tissue when used in therapeutic concentrations, potentially explaining the behavioral, anti-inflammatory, and antineoplastic effects of this drug.;-;-;-;hard_0

2732;15168598;Monitoring the expression profiles of doxorubicin-resistant K562 human leukemia cells by serial analysis of gene expression.;We examined the expression profiles of doxorubicin-resistant K562 cells by serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) to identify novel and/or partially characterized genes that might be related to drug resistance in human leukemia. SAGE complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries were constructed from K562 and doxorubicin-resistant K562 (K562/ADM) cells, and concatamer sequences were analyzed with SAGE 2000 software. We used 9792 tags in the identification of 1076 different transcripts, 296 of which were similarly expressed in K562 and K562/ADM cells. There were 343 genes more actively expressed in K562/ADM than in parental K562 cells and 437 genes expressed less often in K562/ADM cells. K562/ADM cells showed increased expression of well-known genes, including the genes for spectrin beta, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1A (EIF1A), RAD23 homolog B, laminin receptor 1, and polyA-, RAN-, and PAI-1 messenger RNA-binding proteins. K562/ADM cells showed decreased expression of the genes for fatty acid desaturase 1 (FADS1), hemoglobin epsilon 1, N-myristoyltransferase 1, hemoglobin alpha 2, NADH dehydrogenase Fe-S protein 6, heat shock 90-kDa protein, and karyopherin beta 1. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed the increased expression of EIF1A and the decreased expression of FADS1 in K562/ADM cells. Prior to this investigation, such differences in the expression of these genes in doxorubicin-resistant leukemia cells were unknown. Although we do not provide any evidence in the present report for the potential roles of these genes in drug resistance, SAGE may provide a perspective into our understanding of drug resistance in human leukemia that is different from that provided by cDNA microarray analysis. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
2733;23438048;Malaria rapid diagnostic tests in endemic settings.;"Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are instrument-free tests that provide results within 20 min and can be used by community health workers. RDTs detect antigens produced by the Plasmodium parasite such as Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein-2 (PfHPR2) and Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH). The accuracy of RDTs for the diagnosis of uncomplicated P. falciparum infection is equal or superior to routine microscopy (but inferior to expert microscopy). Sensitivity for Plasmodium vivax is 75-100%; for Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium malariae, diagnostic performance is poor. Design limitations of RDTs include poor sensitivity at low parasite densities, susceptibility to the prozone effect (PfHRP2-detecting RDTs), false-negative results due to PfHRP2 deficiency in the case of pfhrp2 gene deletions (PfHRP2-detecting RDTs), cross-reactions between Plasmodium antigens and detection antibodies, false-positive results by other infections and susceptibility to heat and humidity. End-user's errors relate to safety, procedure (delayed reading, incorrect sample and buffer volumes) and interpretation (not recognizing invalid test results, disregarding faint test lines). Withholding antimalarial treatment in the case of negative RDT results tends to be infrequent and tendencies towards over-prescription of antibiotics have been noted. Numerous shortcomings in RDT kits' labelling, instructions for use (correctness and readability) and contents have been observed. The World Health Organization and partners actively address quality assurance of RDTs by comparative testing of RDTs, inspections of manufacturing sites, lot testing and training tools but no formal external quality assessment programme of end-user performance exists.

Southern blots of human DNA probed with a previously characterized OAT cDNA showed a complex pattern of gene fragments, suggesting a gene family. Hybridization of these blots with 5' and 3' OAT cDNA probes indicated that there are at least three to four copies of the OAT (approximately 22 kbp) and OAT-related gene sequence(s). We have isolated and partially characterized human OAT gene clones from total genomic and X-chromosome DNA libraries. Sequence analysis confirmed the following previously reported findings on the functional OAT gene: 11 exons, ten introns, an atypical TATA box (TTTAA), two CCAAT boxes, several GC-rich binding sites, 5' sequence homologous to SV40 enhancer core sequence (GTGGA/GA/GA/GG) and promoter region of three urea cycle enzymes (GTATCCTGCCCTC). In addition, we extended the OAT gene sequence in both the 5' and 3' directions and found its promoter region also contained a sequence homologous to the progesterone receptor (TGTTCA/TCC/T), several of the glucocorticoid responsive element (AGAACA), a cyclic AMP-responsive element (TGACGTCG), and recognition motifs for transcription factors AP-2, NF1 and Sp1. Partial sequence analyses of X-chromosome clones demonstrated an intron-less pseudogene with 77% identity to the functional OAT gene.

In this study, we isolated the novel ICE1-like gene SlICE1a from tomato which contains the conserved bHLH domain, an S-rich motif, and ACT-domain. It is localized in the nucleus and harbors transcription-activating activity in the N-terminal. In addition, the SlICE1a transcript is slightly upregulated by cold stress, salt stress, and osmotic stress. SlICE1a overexpression in tobacco enhances the induction of CBF/DREB and their target genes, consequently increasing the levels of proline, soluble sugars, and late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, and enhancing tolerance to cold stress, osmotic stress, and salt stress. SlICE1a functions in abiotic stress responses by regulating the expression of stress-tolerant genes, and is thus beneficial for crop improvement.  ;polyserine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

One example of this divergence is Pol I's inclusion of a proofreading factor as a bona fide subunit, as opposed to Pol II, which recruits a transcription factor, TFIIS, for proofreading. The A12.2 (A12) subunit of Pol I shares homology with both the Rpb9 subunit of Pol II as well as the transcription factor TFIIS, which promotes RNA cleavage and proofreading by Pol II. In this study, the functional contribution of the TFIIS-like C-terminal domain and the Rpb9-like N-terminal domain of the A12 subunit are probed through mutational analysis. We found that a Pol I mutant lacking the C-terminal domain of the A12 subunit (ΔA12CTD Pol I) is slightly faster than wild-type Pol I in single-nucleotide addition, but ΔA12CTD Pol I lacks RNA cleavage activity. ΔA12CTD Pol I is likewise similar to wild-type Pol I in elongation complex stability, whereas removal of the entire A12 subunit (ΔA12 Pol I) was previously demonstrated to stabilize transcription elongation complexes. Furthermore, the ΔA12CTD Pol I is sensitive to downstream sequence context, as ΔA12CTD Pol I exposed to AT-rich downstream DNA is more arrest prone than ΔA12 Pol I. These data demonstrate that the N-terminal domain of A12 does not stimulate Pol I intrinsic RNA cleavage activity, but rather contributes to core transcription elongation properties of Pol I.;polythreonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
2767;12093792;A novel PAAD-containing protein that modulates NF-kappa B induction by cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta.;PAAD domains are found in diverse proteins of unknown function and are structurally related to a superfamily of protein interaction modules that includes death domains, death effector domains, and Caspase activation and recruitment domains. Using bioinformatics strategies, cDNAs were identified that encode a novel protein of 110 kDa containing a PAAD domain followed by a putative nucleotide-binding (NACHT) domain and several leucine-rich repeat domains. This protein thus resembles Cryopyrin, a protein implicated in hereditary hyperinflammation syndromes, and was termed PAN2 for PAAD and NACHT-containing protein 2. When expressed in HEK293 cells, PAN2 suppressed NF-kappaB induction by the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), suggesting that this protein operates at a point of convergence in these two cytokine signaling pathways. This PAN2-mediated suppression of NF-kappaB was evident both in reporter gene assays that measured NF-kappaB transcriptional activity and electromobility shift assays that measured NF-kappaB DNA binding activity. PAN2 also suppressed NF-kappaB induction resulting from overexpression of several adapter proteins and protein kinases involved in the TNF or IL-1 receptor signal transduction, including TRAF2, TRAF6, RIP, IRAK2, and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase as well as the IkappaB kinases IKKalpha and IKKbeta. PAN2 also inhibited the cytokine-mediated activation of IKKalpha and IKKbeta as measured by in vitro kinase assays. Furthermore, PAN2 association with IKKalpha was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assays, suggesting a direct effect on the IKK complex. These observations suggest a role for PAN2 in modulating NF-kappaB activity in cells, thus providing the insights into the potential functions of PAAD family proteins and their roles in controlling inflammatory responses. ;polyleucine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
2770;23066098;PlantRNA, a database for tRNAs of photosynthetic eukaryotes.;PlantRNA database (http://plantrna.ibmp.cnrs.fr/) compiles transfer RNA (tRNA) gene sequences retrieved from fully annotated plant nuclear, plastidial and mitochondrial genomes. The set of annotated tRNA gene sequences has been manually curated for maximum quality and confidence. The novelty of this database resides in the inclusion of biological information relevant to the function of all the tRNAs entered in the library. This includes 5'- and 3'-flanking sequences, A and B box sequences, region of transcription initiation and poly(T) transcription termination stretches, tRNA intron sequences, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and enzymes responsible for tRNA maturation and modification. Finally, data on mitochondrial import of nuclear-encoded tRNAs as well as the bibliome for the respective tRNAs and tRNA-binding proteins are also included. The current annotation concerns complete genomes from 11 organisms: five flowering plants (Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Populus trichocarpa, Medicago truncatula and Brachypodium distachyon), a moss (Physcomitrella patens), two green algae (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Ostreococcus tauri), one glaucophyte (Cyanophora paradoxa), one brown alga (Ectocarpus siliculosus) and a pennate diatom (Phaeodactylum tricornutum).

The study of programmed cell death, apoptosis, has become one of the main stream in cellular biology, particularly in immunology, developmental biology and oncology. To determine whether the apoptotic cell death induced by anticancer agents could be inhibited by bcl-2 oncogene, we established a bcl-2 transfected human small cell lung cancer cell line, SBC-3/Bcl-2. SBC-3/Bcl-2 showed higher resistance to ADM, CPT-11 and MMC compared to the parental line SBC-3. Agarose gel electrophoresis showed typical DNA fragmentation of SBC-3 following treatment with CPT-11 or MMC. In contrast, the same concentration of the drugs did not induce DNA fragmentation in SBC-3/Bcl-2. However, there was no difference in sensitivity to CDDP, VP-16, ACNU, MTX and Taxol between SBC-3 and SBC-3/Bcl-2 (Ohmori T, et al: Biochem Biophys Res Commun 1993). These results suggest that bcl-2 can modulate the cytotoxicity of some anticancer agents by inhibiting the process of apoptosis. We speculate that some apoptotic pathways are bcl-2-dependent and others bcl-2-independent.;-;-;-;hard_0
2776;8545122;The epidermal growth factor receptor is covalently linked to ubiquitin.;Incubation of cultured human fibroblasts with epidermal growth factor (EGF) causes a proliferative response that is mediated by the binding of the growth factor to specific cell surface receptors. One event that occurs rapidly following EGF binding is the covalent modification of the EGF receptor (EGF-R) by phosphorylation on Ser, Thr, and Tyr residues. Here we report the identification of ubiquitination as a second form of EGF-stimulated covalent modification of the receptor. The LGF receptor was not ubiquitinated in serum-starved cells. However, treatment with EGF caused a rapid increase in EGF-R ubiquitination. In contrast, no EGF-stimulated ubiquitination was found in experiments using cells that express a mutant tyrosine kinase-negative EGF-R. Similarly, ubiquitination of the EGF-R was not observed at 4 degrees C or if the cells are depleted of intracellular K+. Together, these data establish ubiquitination as a form of EGF-stimulated covalent modification of the EGF-R.;-;-;-;hard_0

The mean number of bypass grafts was 2.8 +/- 0.8/pt. In 131 patients (83.4), left internal thoracic artery (LITA) was used to bypass the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The postoperative hospital mortality rate was 6.4%. After 10 years of follow-up, the actuarial survival rate and cardiac event-free rate were 73.6% and 88.9%, respectively calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. A comparison of the long-term results of CABG with and without ITA grafting, showed no statistical difference with respect to actuarial survival rate. However, the cardiac event-free rate was improved by using an ITA graft (92.4% with an ITA vs 77.3% without an ITA, p = 0.047). This result suggested that the use of ITA in patients over 70 years old reduced the incidence of postoperative cardiac events without increasing the operative risk.";-;-;-;hard_0
2779;8952480;DNA binding mechanism of O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase: stoichiometry and effects of DNA base composition and secondary structure on complex stability.;"O6-Alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) is an important cellular defense against the mutagenic effects of DNA alkylating agents. In humans this defense can contribute to the ability of some tumors to resist the effects of chemotherapeutic agents that act through DNA alkylation. We report here studies that characterize the interaction of AGT with DNA. We show that although AGT sediments as a monomer in the absence of DNA, it binds cooperatively to single stranded deoxyribonucleotides. The stoichiometries of complexes formed with 16-, 30-, and 80-base oligodeoxyribonucleotides are 3.8 +/- 0.3, 5.3 +/- 0.2, and 8.9 +/- 0.2, respectively; the binding density decreasing from approximately 4 nt/monomer to approximately 9 nt/monomer as DNA length increases over this range. Binding competition assays show that DNA affinities depend only weakly on base composition or secondary structure, although in general G + C-rich sequences are bound with greater affinity than are A + T-rich ones and single-stranded DNA is bound with greater affinity than duplex forms. These results suggest mechanisms by which AGT may search for alkylated sites and interact with them to effect DNA repair.";polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
2780;9106984;Arterial gene therapy: a molecular biological perspective for the treatment of arterial ischemia.;Since most cells do not naturally incorporate foreign DNA, strategies for arterial gene transfer have generally relied on agents designed to augment cellular DNA uptake such as liposomes, viral vectors, and protein conjugates. However, even when DNA has been successfully introduced into a cell, the likelihood of gene expression remains uncertain because the transgene has to escape lysosomal degradation, be transferred to the nucleus for transcription of mRNA, and be exported to the cytoplasm for translation and/or post-translation modification of the protein product. Transfection efficiency represents the final index of this regulatory sequence. The extent to which this compromises human gene therapy for cardiovascular disease depends in part on the presence or absence of a signal sequence permitting active secretion of the gene product. The implication of these issues is discussed with regard to restenosis and angiogenesis.;-;-;-;hard_0

This critical review aims first to introduce the different definitions of SMR EEG target in BCI/Neurofeedback studies and to summarize the background from neurophysiological and neuroplasticity studies that led to SMR being considered as reliable and valid EEG targets to improve motor skills through BCI/neurofeedback procedures. The second objective of this review is to introduce the main findings regarding SMR BCI/neurofeedback in healthy subjects. Third, the main findings regarding BCI/neurofeedback efficiency in patients with hypokinetic activities (in particular, motor deficit following stroke) as well as in patients with hyperkinetic activities (in particular, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, ADHD) will be introduced. Due to a range of limitations, a clear association between SMR BCI/neurofeedback training and enhanced motor skills has yet to be established. However, SMR BCI/neurofeedback appears promising, and highlights many important challenges for clinical neurophysiology with regards to therapeutic approaches using BCI/neurofeedback.;-;-;-;hard_0
2791;9415654;Induction of cyclooxygenase-2 by parathyroid hormone in human osteoblasts in culture.;"OBJECTIVE
Parathyroid hormone (PTH) induced bone resorption by osteoclasts depends on the presence of osteoblasts. PTH induced production of prostaglandins by osteoblasts and induction of bone resorption by prostaglandins suggest that these autacoids may be implicated in the effects of PTH on bone. Our objective was to determine if the increase in prostaglandin production induced in human osteoblasts by PTH is due to an increase in cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression.


METHODS
Primary cultures of human osteoblasts were obtained from specimens of trabecular bone. Confluent cells were treated with PTH, dexamethasone or compound NS-398, a specific COX-2 inhibitor. The concentration of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the supernatants was determined by radioimmunoassay and COX-2 mRNA levels evaluated by Northern blot.


RESULTS
PTH induced COX-2 mRNA expression and PGE2 production. These effects were time and concentration dependent and were inhibited by dexamethasone. Compound NS-398 reduced PGE2 production to the same extent as dexamethasone, and neither compound had an additive effect on this variable.


CONCLUSION
These results show that PTH induces COX-2 expression in human osteoblasts in culture and suggest that this isoenzyme is the main factor in the control of prostaglandin synthesis in these experimental conditions.";-;-;-;hard_0
2801;10623511;The structure of ribonuclease P protein from Staphylococcus aureus reveals a unique binding site for single-stranded RNA.;Ribonuclease P (RNaseP) catalyses the removal of the 5'-leader sequence from pre-tRNA to produce the mature 5' terminus. The prokaryotic RNaseP holoenzyme consists of a catalytic RNA component and a protein subunit (RNaseP protein), which plays an auxiliary but essential role in vivo by binding to the 5'-leader sequence and broadening the substrate specificity of the ribozyme. We determined the three-dimensional high-resolution structure of the RNaseP protein from Staphylococcus aureus (117 amino acid residues) by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in solution. The protein has an alphabeta-fold, similar to the ribonucleoprotein domain. We used small nucleic acid molecules as a model for the 5'-leader sequence to probe the propensity for generic single-stranded RNA binding on the protein surface. The NMR results reveal a contiguous interaction site, which is identical with the previously identified leader sequence binding site in RNaseP holoenzyme. The conserved arginine-rich motif does not bind single-stranded RNA. It is likely that this peptide segment binds selectively to double-stranded sections of P RNA, which are conformationally more rigid. Given the essentiality of RNaseP for the viability of the organism, knowledge of the S. aureus protein structure and insight into its interaction with RNA will help us to develop RNaseP and RNaseP protein as targets for novel antibiotics against this pathogen. ;polyarginine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

We found that deletion of cys1, cys2 or the entire cysteine-rich domain increases the basal activity of protein kinase D leading to a constitutively active form of this enzyme. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that the cysteine-rich domain of Protein kinase D plays a negative role in the regulation of protein kinase D kinase activity. ;polycysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function

The total nucleated cell count was higher (3.4 versus 3.1 × 108/mL, P = .05), but CD4+ T cells (2.3 versus 2.7 × 107/mL, P = .09) were lower in the G-CSF group with mobilization of regulatory T cells being similar. NK cells were skewed toward the CD56+/16- subset in both groups, varying significantly from the steady-state NK subset ratio in PB. The time to engraftment, incidences of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease, nonrelapse mortality, and overall survival were also similar.

2813;23705659;Autotoxicity mechanism of Oryza sativa: transcriptome response in rice roots exposed to ferulic acid.;Autotoxicity plays an important role in regulating crop yield and quality. To help characterize the autotoxicity mechanism of rice, we performed a large-scale, transcriptomic analysis of the rice root response to ferulic acid, an autotoxin from rice straw. Root growth rate was decreased and reactive oxygen species, calcium content and lipoxygenase activity were increased with increasing ferulic acid concentration in roots. Transcriptome analysis revealed more transcripts responsive to short ferulic-acid exposure (1- and 3-h treatments, 1,204 genes) than long exposure (24 h, 176 genes). Induced genes were involved in cell wall formation, chemical detoxification, secondary metabolism, signal transduction, and abiotic stress response. Genes associated with signaling and biosynthesis for ethylene and jasmonic acid were upregulated with ferulic acid. Ferulic acid upregulated ATP-binding cassette and amino acid/auxin permease transporters as well as genes encoding signaling components such as leucine-rich repeat VIII and receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases VII protein kinases, APETALA2/ethylene response factor, WRKY, MYB and Zinc-finger protein expressed in inflorescence meristem transcription factors. The results of a transcriptome analysis suggest the molecular mechanisms of plants in response to FA, including toxicity, detoxicification and signaling machinery. FA may have a significant effect on inhibiting rice root elongation through modulating ET and JA hormone homeostasis. FA-induced gene expression of AAAP transporters may contribute to detoxicification of the autotoxin. Moreover, the WRKY and Myb TFs and LRR-VIII and SD-2b kinases might regulate downstream genes under FA stress but not general allelochemical stress. This comprehensive description of gene expression information could greatly facilitate our understanding of the mechanisms of autotoxicity in plants. ;polyleucine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
2814;23052185;Zip14 expression induced by lipopolysaccharides in macrophages attenuates inflammatory response.;"We investigated the role and regulation of zinc transporters in the activation of the inflammatory response in macrophages. Our exploratory computational study found that Zip14 (SLC39A14) was consistently up-regulated in activated macrophages; we therefore focused subsequently on that gene in the mechanistic study. The expression and function of Zip14 was assessed in primary macrophages obtained by in-vitro differentiation of monocytes from human blood. Primary macrophages were subjected to treatments with lipopolysaccharides, cytokines, chemicals, and pharmacological agents. SLC39A14 and inflammatory cytokine gene expressions were assessed by RT-qPCR. Zip14 siRNA knockdown was performed to explore the gene function. Lipopolysaccharide's inflammatory stimulus was a strong inducer of SLC39A14 mRNA expression in macrophages. This induction was dependent on calcium signaling, GC-rich DNA-binding, and NF-κB down-regulation. Impregnation of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone further enhanced Zip14 expression while reducing interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α production. Zip14 knockdown in macrophages attenuated the expression and secretion of cytokines, indicating a buffering function for this zinc transporter. Collectively, our results identified the zinc transporter Zip14 as expressed downstream of lipopolysaccharide signals in macrophages. Zip14 induction had a regulatory function in cytokine production.

There has been a favorable trend in major risk factor reduction and an average 3% annual decline in cardiovascular disease death rates over the past decade. Yet, CVD death rates still exceed that for many countries and not all segments of the U.S. population have benefited equally. Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death and disability in this country. The role of epidemiologic research and prevention strategies in addressing this issue has been underestimated. Unresolved research questions require further epidemiologic research in order to improve application of known preventive measures and explore other approaches toward the prevention of cardiovascular disease. It is well established that attention to life-style changes and pharmacologic approaches can prevent cardiovascular disease in those at high risk and reduce the likelihood of subsequent cardiac events among patients with known cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, small changes in the distribution of risk factors through community intervention can have tremendous impact on cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Preventive research requires an appropriate framework and plan to satisfy or exceed the needs in keeping with the national goals for Healthy People 2000.

2817;8441661;Zebrafish pou[c]: a divergent POU family gene ubiquitously expressed during embryogenesis.;We report the isolation and characterization of cDNA for a novel zebrafish (Brachyodanio rerio) POU domain gene, pou[c], which is ubiquitously expressed during embryonic development. This gene encodes a 610 amino acids long protein with a 149 amino acid POU domain ending only 8 residues before the C terminus. The 453 amino acids long region N-terminal to the POU domain contains several features typical of transcriptional activation domains such as an acidic region with a putative amphipathic alpha-helix, a glutamine-rich region, and short threonine- and/or serine-rich regions. Comparison of the POU domain of pou[c] to other known POU sequences clearly show that pou[c] has the most divergent POU domain sequence reported to date. Thus, we suggest that pou[c] should be placed as the presently sole member of a new, sixth class of POU proteins. DNA-binding studies revealed that pou[c] is not an octamer-binding transcription factor like the Oct proteins described from mammals, chicken and Xenopus. Rather, pou[c] binds with high affinity to the TAATGARAT motif found in the promoters of the herpes simplex virus immediate early genes and to degenerate octamer-TAATGA motifs.

2818;19111170;Purification and analysis of the decapping activator Lsm1p-7p-Pat1p complex from yeast.;"Biochemical analysis of the components of the mRNA decay machinery is crucial to understand the mechanisms of mRNA decay. The Lsm1p-7p-Pat1p complex is a key activator of decapping in the 5' to 3'-mRNA decay pathway that is highly conserved in all eukaryotes. The first step in this pathway is poly(A) shortening that is followed by the selective decapping and subsequent 5' to 3'-exonucleolytic degradation of the oligoadenylated mRNAs. Earlier studies suggested that the Lsm1p-7p-Pat1p complex preferentially associates with oligoadenylated mRNAs and facilitates their decapping in vivo (Tharun and Parker, 2001a; Tharun et al., 2000). They also showed that the Lsm1p through Lsm7p and Pat1p are involved in protecting the 3'-ends of mRNAs in vivo from trimming (He and Parker, 2001). Therefore, to gain better insight into the biologic function of the Lsm1p-7p-Pat1p complex, it is important to determine its in vitro RNA binding properties. Here I describe the methods we use in my laboratory for the purification and in vitro RNA binding analysis of this complex from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Purification was achieved with tandem affinity chromatography using a split-tag strategy. This involved use of a strain expressing FLAG-tagged Lsm1p and 6xHis-tagged Lsm5p and purification by a two-step procedure with an anti-FLAG antibody matrix followed by a Ni-NTA matrix. The purified complex was analyzed for its RNA binding properties with gel mobility shift assays. Such analyses showed that this complex has the intrinsic ability to distinguish between oligoadenylated and polyadenylated RNAs and that it binds near the 3'-ends of RNAs (Chowdhury et al., 2007). These observations, therefore, highlighted the importance of the intrinsic RNA binding properties of this complex as key determinants of its in vivo functions.

The presence of progesterone receptor (PR) is expression of an intact oestrogen regulatory pathway of breast malignant epithelial cells and represents a parameter of cell differentiation in breast cancer. In this study we have examined the relationship between IGF-II mRNA expression and ER, PR content in 75 breast cancer. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections were used to preserve histological details. IGF-II mRNA was evaluated by in situ hybridisation method and ER, PR by immunohistochemistry. IGF-II mRNA was scored semi-quantitatively: 2.6% breast tumour specimen expressed no IGF-II mRNA, 46.7% had low levels of expression (IGF-II-) and 50.7% had moderate or high IGF-II mRNA content (IGF-II+). IGF-II mRNA was found in the stroma fibroblasts surrounding malignant lesions and no signal was detected in malignant epithelial cells. In contrast, ER and PR were expressed only by neoplastic epithelial cells and no immunoreactivity was found in the stroma: 50/75 (66.6%) breast cancer specimens were positive for ER (ER+) and 35 (46.6%) for PR (PR+). Both, IGF-II mRNA and PR were directly correlated with the stromal proliferation (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively). No relationship was found between IGF-II RNA and ER. In contrast 24/35 (73.5%) PR breast cancer tissues were IGF-II+ (p < 0.01) and a strong correlation was found between epithelial PR immunostaining and stromal IGF-II mRNA content (p < 0.003). Our data indicate that in breast cancer IGF-II mRNA is generally expressed by stromal cells and ER and PR by epithelial cancer cells, and that IGF-II mRNA expression is strongly related with both percentage and staining intensity of PR+ epithelial cancer cells. These data support the hypothesis that IGF-II produced by the fibroblasts may exert a paracrin effect on malignant epithelium regulating its differentiation.;-;-;-;hard_0
2821;29941967;Accumulation of poly(A) RNA in nuclear granules enriched in Sam68 in motor neurons from the SMNΔ7 mouse model of SMA.;Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe motor neuron (MN) disease caused by the deletion or mutation of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, which results in reduced levels of the SMN protein and the selective degeneration of lower MNs. The best-known function of SMN is the biogenesis of spliceosomal snRNPs, the major components of the pre-mRNA splicing machinery. Therefore, SMN deficiency in SMA leads to widespread splicing abnormalities. We used the SMN∆7 mouse model of SMA to investigate the cellular reorganization of polyadenylated mRNAs associated with the splicing dysfunction in MNs. We demonstrate that SMN deficiency induced the abnormal nuclear accumulation in euchromatin domains of poly(A) RNA granules (PARGs) enriched in the splicing regulator Sam68. However, these granules lacked other RNA-binding proteins, such as TDP43, PABPN1, hnRNPA12B, REF and Y14, which are essential for mRNA processing and nuclear export. These effects were accompanied by changes in the alternative splicing of the Sam68-dependent Bcl-x and Nrnx1 genes, as well as changes in the relative accumulation of the intron-containing Chat, Chodl, Myh9 and Myh14 mRNAs, which are all important for MN functions. PARG-containing MNs were observed at presymptomatic SMA stage, increasing their number during the symptomatic stage. Moreover, the massive accumulations of poly(A) RNA granules in MNs was accompanied by the cytoplasmic depletion of polyadenylated mRNAs for their translation. We suggest that the SMN-dependent abnormal accumulation of polyadenylated mRNAs and Sam68 in PARGs reflects a severe dysfunction of both mRNA processing and translation, which could contribute to SMA pathogenesis. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
2822;1620119;Oct2 transactivation from a remote enhancer position requires a B-cell-restricted activity.;Previous cotransfection experiments had demonstrated that ectopic expression of the lymphocyte-specific transcription factor Oct2 could efficiently activate a promoter containing an octamer motif. Oct2 expression was unable to stimulate a multimerized octamer enhancer element in HeLa cells, however. We have tested a variety of Oct2 isoforms generated by alternative splicing for the capability to activate an octamer enhancer in nonlymphoid cells and a B-cell line. Our analyses show that several Oct2 isoforms can stimulate from a remote position but that this stimulation is restricted to B cells. This result indicates the involvement of either a B-cell-specific cofactor or a specific modification of a cofactor or the Oct2 protein in Oct2-mediated enhancer activation. Mutational analyses indicate that the carboxy-terminal domain of Oct2 is critical for enhancer activation. Moreover, this domain conferred enhancing activity when fused to the Oct1 protein, which by itself was unable to stimulate from a remote position. The glutamine-rich activation domain present in the amino-terminal portion of Oct2 and the POU domain contribute only marginally to the transactivation function from a distal position.;polyglutamine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
2823;9209370;Leukemogenesis by the chromosomal translocations.;"The AML1 is the most commonly involved transcription factor gene in human leukemias and forms chimeric transcription factor genes, namely, AML1/MTG8 by the t(8;21), AML1/EVI-1 by the t(3;21), and TEL/AML1 by the t(12;21). The AML1a and AML1b, two isoforms of the AML1 protein, are translated from the AML1 gene by the alternative splicing. The shorter form and longer form are named as AML1a and AML1b, respectively. The AML1b contains the runt homology domain as a DNA-binding domain and the serine/proline/threonine-rich domain (PST domain) as a putative transactivation domain. The AML1a contains only the runt homology domain, but not the PST domain. The AML1b has a transactivation ability through the PEBP2 site and stimulates differentiation of myeloid cells. On the other hand, AML1a cna bind the PEBP2 site, but does not show a transactivation ability through the PEBP2 site. The AML1a dominantly suppresses transactivation induced by the AML1b and has the ability to block differentiation of myeloid cells. It is a reasonable hypothesis that the molecular ratio of AML1a to AML1b in myeloid cells could determine whether they proliferate or undergo a terminal differentiation.

2825;10409662;The cyclic AMP response element modulator family regulates the insulin gene transcription by interacting with transcription factor IID.;"We analyzed a mechanism of transcriptional regulation of the human insulin gene by cyclic AMP response element modulator (CREM) through four cyclic AMP response elements (CREs). We isolated two novel CREM isoforms (CREMDeltaQ1 and CREMDeltaQ2), which lack one of the glutamine-rich domains, Q1 and Q2 respectively, and six known isoforms (CREMtaualpha, CREMalpha, inducible cyclic AMP early repressor (ICER) I, ICER Igamma, CREM-17X, and CREM-17) from rat pancreatic islets and the RINm5F pancreatic beta-cell line. CREM isoforms functioned as efficient transcriptional activators or repressors to modulate insulin promoter activity by binding to all of the insulin CREs. The binding activity of repressors is higher than that of activators and suppressed not only basal activity but also activator-induced activities. Furthermore, CREM activator interacted directly with the transcription factor IID components hTAF(II)130 and TATA box-binding protein (TBP). These results suggest that the activation of the insulin gene transcription by CREM activator is mediated by not only direct binding to the CREs but also by recruiting transcription factor IID to the insulin promoter via its interaction with hTAF(II)130 and TBP. On the other hand, the CREM repressor ICER competitively interrupts the binding of the activators to CREs and does not interact with either TBP or hTAF(II)130; therefore, it might fail to stabilize the basal transcriptional machinery and repress transactivation.

2826;17704172;The effect of charge-charge interactions on the kinetics of alpha-helix formation.;"The formation of the monomeric alpha-helix represents one of the simplest scenarios in protein folding; however, our current understanding of the folding dynamics of the alpha-helix motif is mainly based on studies of alanine-rich model peptides. To examine the effect of peptide sequence on the folding kinetics of alpha-helices, we studied the relaxation kinetics of a 21-residue helical peptide, Conantokin-T (Con-T), using time-resolved infrared spectroscopy in conjunction with a laser-induced temperature jump technique. Con-T is a neuroactive peptide containing a large number of charged residues that is found in the venom of the piscivorous cone snail Conus tulipa . The temperature-jump relaxation kinetics of Con-T is distinctly slower than that of previously studied alanine-based peptides, suggesting that the folding time of alpha-helices is sequence-dependent. Furthermore, it appears that the slower folding of Con-T can be attributed to the fact that its helical conformation is stabilized by charge-charge interactions or salt bridges. Although this finding contradicts an earlier molecular dynamics simulation, it also has implications for existing models of protein folding. ";polyalanine;helix;-;LCR_with_function

2833;1377223;Cloning and expression of Trypanosoma cruzi ribosomal protein P0 and epitope analysis of anti-P0 autoantibodies in Chagas' disease patients.;"Chagas' disease, caused by the intracellular protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a major cause of heart failure in endemic areas. Antigenic mimicry by T. cruzi antigens sharing epitopes with host macromolecules has been implicated in the pathogenesis which is thought to have a significant autoimmune component. We report herein on the cloning and characterization of a full-length cDNA from a T. cruzi expression library encoding a protein, TcP0, that is homologous to the human 38-kD ribosomal phosphoprotein HuP0. The T. cruzi P0 protein shows a clustering of residues that are evolutionarily conserved in higher eukaryotes. This includes an alanine- and glycine-rich region adjacent to a highly charged COOH terminus. This ""hallmark"" domain is the basis of the crossreactivity of the highly immunogenic eukaryotic P protein family. We found that T. cruzi-infected individuals have antibodies reacting with host (self) P proteins, as well as with recombinant TcP0. Deletion of the six carboxy-terminal amino acids abolished the reactivity of the T. cruzi infection sera with TcP0. This is similar to the specificity of anti-P autoantibodies described for a subset of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Elkon, K., E. Bonfa, R. Llovet, W. Danho, H. Weissbach, and N. Brot. 1988. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 85:5186). These results suggest that T. cruzi P proteins may contribute to the development of autoreactive antibodies in Chagas' disease, and that the underlying mechanisms of anti-P autoantibody may be similar in Chagas' and SLE patients. This study represents the first definitive report of the cloning of a full-length T. cruzi antigen that mimics a characterized host homologue in structure, function, and shared antigenicity."; polyglycine ;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
2835;17706965;The Parkinson's disease-associated protein, leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), is an authentic GTPase that stimulates kinase activity.;Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are the leading cause of autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (PD). LRRK2, a member of the ROCO protein family, contains both Ras GTPase-like (Roc) and kinase (MAPKKK) domains, as well as other functional motifs. Here, we have identified LRRK2 as the first mammalian ROCO protein that is an authentic and functional GTPase, defined by the ability to bind GTP and undergo intrinsic GTP hydrolysis. Furthermore, the Roc domain is sufficient for this native GTPase activity and binds and hydrolyzes GTP indistinguishably from the Ras-related small GTPase, Rac1. The PD-associated mutation, R1441C, located within the Roc domain, leads to an increase in LRRK2 kinase activity and a decrease in the rate of GTP hydrolysis, compared to the wild-type protein, in an in vitro assay. This finding suggests that the R1441C mutation may help stabilize an activated state of LRRK2. Additionally, LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation is stimulated upon binding of non-hydrolyzable GTP analogs, suggesting that LRRK2 is an MAPKKK-activated intramolecularly by its own GTPase. Since GTPases and MAPKKKs are upstream regulators of multiple signal transduction cascades, LRRK2 may play a central role in integrating pathways involved in neuronal cell signaling and the pathogenesis of PD. ;polyleucine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
2839;25047033;Distinctive genetic activity pattern of the human dental pulp between deciduous and permanent teeth.;Human deciduous and permanent teeth exhibit different developmental processes, morphologies, histological characteristics and life cycles. In addition, their pulp tissues react differently to external stimuli, such as the pulp sensitivity test, dental trauma and pulp therapy materials. These suggest differences in gene expression and regulation, and in this study we compared gene-expression profiles of the human dental pulp from deciduous and permanent teeth. Pulp tissues from permanent premolars and deciduous molars aged 11-14 years were extirpated and mRNA was isolated for cDNA microarray analysis, and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Other teeth were used for immunohistochemical analysis (IHC). Microarray analysis identified 263 genes with a twofold or greater difference in expression level between the two types of pulp tissue, 43 and 220 of which were more abundant in deciduous and permanent pulp tissues, respectively. qPCR analysis was conducted for eight randomly selected genes, and the findings were consistent with the cDNA microarray results. IHC confirmed that insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) was broadly expressed in deciduous dental pulp tissue, but minimally expressed in permanent dental pulp tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that calbindin 1 (CALB1), leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5), and gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor beta 1 (GABRB1) were abundantly expressed in permanent predentin/odontoblasts, but only minimally expressed in deciduous dental pulp tissue. These results show that deciduous and permanent pulp tissues have different characteristics and gene expression, suggesting that they may have different functions and responses to therapies focused on pulp or dentin regeneration.  ;polyleucine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
2840;28112758;Regeneration of thyroid follicles from primordial cells in a murine thyroidectomized model.;The functional unit of the thyroid gland, the thyroid follicle, dynamically responds to various stimuli to maintain thyroid hormone homeostasis. However, thyroid follicles in the adult human thyroid gland have a very limited regenerative capacity following partial resection of the thyroid gland. To gain insight into follicle regeneration in the adult thyroid gland, we observed the regeneration processes of murine thyroid follicles after partial resection of the lower third of the thyroid gland in 10-week-old male C57BL/6 mice. Based on sequential observation of the partially resected thyroid lobe, we found primitive follicles forming in the area corresponding to the central zone of the intact lateral thyroid lobe. The primitive thyroid follicles were multiciliated and had coarsely vacuolated cytoplasm and large vesicular nuclei. Consistently, these primitive follicular cells did not express the differentiation markers paired box gene-8 and thyroid transcription factor-1 (clone SPT24), but were positive for forkhead box protein A2 and leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 4/GPR48. Follicles newly generated from the primitive follicles had clear or vacuolar cytoplasm with dense, darkly stained nuclei. At day 21 after partial thyroidectomy, the tall cuboidal follicular epithelial cells had clear or vacuolar cytoplasm, and the intraluminal colloid displayed pale staining. Smaller activated follicles were found in the central zone of the lateral lobe, whereas larger mature follicles were located in the peripheral zone. Based on these observations, we propose that the follicle regeneration process in the partially resected adult murine thyroid gland associated with the appearance of primitive follicular cells may be a platform for the budding of differentiated follicles in mice. ;polyleucine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
2851;3958693;Spatial properties of the prolonged depolarizing afterpotential in barnacle photoreceptors. II. Antagonistic interactions.;"In the preceding article, we investigated the spatial properties of the induction of the prolonged depolarizing afterpotential (PDA) by shifting visual pigment from the rhodopsin (R) to the metarhodopsin (M) state in the barnacle photoreceptor. In this work, we have studied the ranges within the cell of the antagonistic effects on the PDA of M-to-R transfer. When this transfer occurs during a PDA, it depresses the PDA; when it precedes PDA induction, it impedes that induction (""anti-PDA""). These ranges were previously shown (by a statistical technique) to be at least a few tens of nanometers within a half-second (D greater than 10(-13) cm2 s-1). We now demonstrate, with local illumination techniques in which a PDA was induced in one side of the cell and PDA depression or anti-PDA was induced in the other side, that both ranges are much smaller than the cell diameter (approximately 100 microns) within 30 s (D less than 10(-6)). We further show, using a less direct but shorter-range technique involving colored polarized light, that the interaction of the PDA with the anti-PDA is restricted to less than approximately 6 microns (D less than 6 X 10(-9)). This figure is quite low and suggests that the interaction may be confined to the pigment molecules, possibly in a complex of the type suggested in the preceding article.";-;-;-;hard_0
2853;11248185;Sodium ion-translocating decarboxylases.;"The review is concerned with three Na(+)-dependent biotin-containing decarboxylases, which catalyse the substitution of CO(2) by H(+) with retention of configuration (DeltaG degrees '=-30 kJ/mol): oxaloacetate decarboxylase from enterobacteria, methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase from Veillonella parvula and Propiogenium modestum, and glutaconyl-CoA decarboxylase from Acidaminococcus fermentans. The enzymes represent complexes of four functional domains or subunits, a carboxytransferase, a mobile alanine- and proline-rich biotin carrier, a 9-11 membrane-spanning helix-containing Na(+)-dependent carboxybiotin decarboxylase and a membrane anchor. In the first catalytic step the carboxyl group of the substrate is converted to a kinetically activated carboxylate in N-carboxybiotin. After swing-over to the decarboxylase, an electrochemical Na(+) gradient is generated; the free energy of the decarboxylation is used to translocate 1-2 Na(+) from the inside to the outside, whereas the proton comes from the outside. At high [Na(+)], however, the decarboxylases appear to catalyse a mere Na(+)/Na(+) exchange. This finding has implications for the life of P. modestum in sea water, which relies on the synthesis of ATP via Delta(mu)Na(+) generated by decarboxylation. In many sequenced genomes from Bacteria and Archaea homologues of the carboxybiotin decarboxylase from A. fermentans with up to 80% sequence identity have been detected.

2855;9334209;Transcriptional repression mediated by the PR domain zinc finger gene RIZ.;"The RIZ (G3B or MTB-Zf) zinc finger gene is structurally related to the myeloid leukemia gene, MDS1-EVI1, and the transcription repressor/differentiation factor, PRDI-BF1/BLIMP1, through a conserved amino-terminal motif, the PR domain. Similar to MDS1-EVI1, RIZ gene normally produces two protein products that differ by the PR domain. The smaller protein RIZ2 lacks the PR domain of RIZ1 but is otherwise identical to RIZ1. Here we show that RIZ proteins bind to GC-rich or Sp-1-binding elements and repress transcription. Both RIZ1 and RIZ2 repressed the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) promoter, one of the best characterized eukaryotic promoters. Recombinant RIZ1 proteins were able to bind to HSV-TK promoter. This binding was mediated by the GC-rich Sp-1 elements of the promoter and the first three zinc finger motifs of RIZ1. RIZ also encodes a repressor domain that was mapped to the central region of the protein. Fusion of this region to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain generated GAL4 site-dependent transcriptional repressors. We also show that RIZ1 protein can efficiently repress the simian virus 40 (SV40) early promoter, which primarily consists of Sp-1 sites; RIZ2, however, only weakly repressed this promoter, suggesting a role for PR in modulating RIZ protein function. The data have implications for a role of RIZ proteins in the regulation of cellular gene promoters, many of which are characterized by GC-rich elements.

Histone is a significant mediator in sepsis. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) possessed beneficial effects on sepsis. Thereby, this study aims to figure out whether histone can disrupt glycocalyx and to investigate the protective effect and mechanism of UFH. Male mice (C57BL/6, 8-10 weeks old, weighing 20-25 g) were randomly divided into five groups including control group, histone group, histone + UFH group, histone + heparinase (HPA) inhibitor group, and histone + UFH + HPA inhibitor group. The mice were treated with histone (50 mg/kg) via tail vein immediately after HPA (20 mg/kg) injection. UFH (400 U/kg) was injected 1h after histone administration. The other groups were injected with equal volume of sterile saline accordingly. UFH alleviated histone-induced lung injury and pulmonary edema. UFH inhibited histone-induced lung coagulation activation and inflammatory response. UFH treatment markedly inhibited pulmonary glycocalyx degradation by reducing the histone-induced decrease in the levels of lung syndecan-1 mRNA and protein. UFH downregulated histone-induced expression of HPA mRNA and protein, and thus alleviated glycocalyx degradation. UFH protects against histone-induced pulmonary glycocalyx injury partly by heparinase pathway.;-;-;-;hard_0
2860;9323851;Aspects of epidemiology of Campylobacter in poultry.;Campylobacter bacteria, which in humans cause infections with severe symptoms of diarrhoea, are mainly transmitted by food, especially poultry meat products. Several studies on Campylobacter colonization in breeders, laying hens, and broilers were carried out. Isolates were serotyped, using a modification of the Penner system, in order to identify epidemiological factors contributing to the Campylobacter colonization of poultry. No evidence was found for vertical transmission from breeder flocks via the hatchery to progeny, nor for horizontal transmission from one broiler flock to the next via persistent contamination of the broiler house. The major route for Campylobacter colonization of poultry is horizontal transmission from the environment. Pigs and poultry flocks (broilers, laying hens, and breeders), and to a lesser extent sheep and cattle, were found to be potential sources of Campylobacter contamination. Horizontal intervention procedures at the farm level have to be studied further to evaluate the effectiveness of strict hygienic practices during the whole production period. Screening for antibiotic resistance revealed 181 out of 617 Campylobacter isolates (29%), originating from a large number of broiler flocks, to be quinolone resistant. Quinolone treatment of Campylobacter colonized broiler chicks was found to induce quinolone resistance under experimental conditions. Therefore, quinolone treatment should not be seen as an answer to the problem of Campylobacter colonization in poultry flocks.;-;-;-;hard_0

2867;10712544;Differential screening indicates a dramatic change in mRNA profiles during grape berry ripening. Cloning and characterization of cDNAs encoding putative cell wall and stress response proteins.;We used differential screening to isolate ripening-associated cDNAs from a Shiraz grape (Vitis vinifera L.) berry cDNA library. A rapid increase in the mRNA levels of a number of cDNAs not present in unripe fruit occurred in grape berries at the onset of ripening. The putative translation products of some of these clones had homologs in other species that are involved in cell wall structure. These included four proline-rich proteins, a small protein that is similar to the non-catalytic, N-terminal domain of some pectin methylesterases, and two other glutamate-rich proteins. The remainder of the clones encoded putative stress response proteins. These included two thaumatin-like proteins, a metallothionein, a transcription factor, a cytochrome P450 enzyme, and proteins induced by water, sugar, and/or cold stress in other species. Many of the homologs of the grape cDNAs thought to be involved in cell wall structure or stress-related responses also accumulate in a developmental manner in other plants. This may indicate that the grape mRNAs accumulate in response to stresses such as the storage of high concentrations of sugars and rapid cell expansion, or they may accumulate as part of the ripening developmental program. ;polyproline;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

The effects of terutroban were compared with those of aspirin, another antiplatelet agent, and rosuvastatin, known to exert end-organ protection in SHRSP. Salt-loaded male SHRSP were treated orally once a day with vehicle, terutroban (30 mg/kg/day), aspirin (60 mg/kg/day), or rosuvastatin (10 mg/kg/day). Compared with vehicle, and regardless of any effect on blood pressure or serum thromboxane B(2) levels, terutroban significantly increased survival (p < 0.001) as a consequence of a delayed brain lesion occurrence monitored by magnetic resonance imaging (p < 0.001), and a delayed increase of proteinuria (p < 0.001). Terutroban decreased cerebral mRNA transcription of interleukin-1beta, transforming growth factor-beta, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 after 6 weeks of dietary treatment. Terutroban also prevented the accumulation of urinary acute-phase proteins at high molecular weight, identified as markers of systemic inflammation, and assessed longitudinally by one-dimensional electrophoresis. Terutroban also has protective effects on the vasculature as suggested by the preservation of endothelial function and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase expression in isolated carotid arteries. These effects are similar to those obtained with rosuvastatin, and superior to those of aspirin. Terutroban increases survival in SHRSP by reducing systemic inflammation as well as preserving endothelial function. These data support clinical development of terutroban in the prevention of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular complications of atherothrombosis.;-;-;-;hard_0
2879;2664778;Cooperative activation of a eukaryotic transcription factor: interaction between Cu(I) and yeast ACE1 protein.;"Cu ions activate yeast metallothionein gene transcription by altering the conformation and DNA-binding activity of the ACE1 transcription factor. We show that this conformational switch occurs in an all-or-none highly cooperative fashion (Hill coefficient = 4). Analysis of the subunit composition of ACE1 bound to DNA indicates that cooperativity results from the binding of multiple Cu(I) ions to the cysteine-rich DNA-binding domain. Surprisingly, DNA has little effect on the interaction between Cu(I) and ACE1 as assayed by partial proteolysis; this suggests that the effect of the metal on DNA binding is primarily kinetic rather than thermodynamic. Although Ag(I) also activates ACE1, it acts less cooperatively than the smaller Cu(I) ion and the resulting metalloprotein has a reduced affinity for DNA. The cooperative interaction between Cu and ACE1 allows the cell to respond to a small change in metal concentration by a large change in gene expression.

Both AHR and ARNT belong to a family of proteins that includes the Drosophila circadian-rhythm protein and ""single-minded"" protein. These proteins share a domain called the PAS domain. In addition to the PAS domain, both AHR and ARNT contain basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and glutamine (Q)-rich domains. The roles of these domains in the receptor-mediated transcriptional activation are not understood completely. By using the yeast two-hybrid system with the N-terminal half of AHR as a probe, which contains the bHLH and PAS regions, to screen cDNA libraries prepared from human lymphocytes and C57BL mouse liver for clones encoding proteins capable of binding to these regions, we isolated a partial ARNT cDNA clone. These results demonstrated that the N-terminal half of AHR is capable of interacting with ARNT in yeast (probably through the bHLH motif). A fusion protein containing the GAL4 DNA binding domain (DB) linked to the full-length AHR was not capable of activating expression of a reporter gene containing the GAL4 DNA binding site, suggesting that ligand-free AHR alone has no transactivating properties in yeast. However, the C-terminal portion (amino acid residues 580-797) of the AHR, including the Q-rich domain, could confer transactivation of the reporter gene expression in the same system, suggesting that the N-terminal portion of the AHR contains transcription repression properties. In contrast, GAL4(DB)-ARNT fusion protein was able to activate expression of the same reporter gene. Deletion analysis of ARNT revealed that the C-terminal 75 amino acids, including the Q-rich domain, exhibited full transactivation function in yeast and mammalian cells. These results revealed different structural organizations for the transactivation properties between AHR and ARNT, although both contained transactivation domains at the C-termini.

By expression of the T. thermophilus MetRS gene in Escherichia coli cells, thermostable MetRS was overproduced and purified to homogeneity by heat treatment and one-step column chromatography. The amino acid sequence of T. thermophilus MetRS showed low identities (approximately 25%) with those of MetRSs from E. coli, and cytoplasm and mitochondria of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, the amino acid residues in the binding sites for ATP and the anticodon and the 3' terminus of tRNA(Met) are highly conserved among the four MetRSs. T. thermophilus MetRS has a zinc finger-like sequence with all the three cysteine residues and a histidine residue. By site-directed mutagenesis of one of the cysteine residues (Cys127) of T. thermophilus MetRS, the SH group was found to be important for methionyl-tRNA synthesis. Just upstream of the structural gene for T. thermophilus MetRS there is a short open reading frame which codes for a methionine-rich peptide and is partly overlapped with an alternative terminator/antiterminator structure, suggesting that transcription of this gene is regulated by attenuation.

Phosphate incorporation into pp50 was sensitive to divalent cations that inhibit sulfhydryl-dependent enzymes in the following order of potency: Zn2+ greater than Hg2+ greater than Cd2+, Cu2+, and Pb2+. Phosphate incorporation into CAP2 with polylysine present was insensitive to divalent cations. The alkylating agents dithiodinitrobenzene, phenacyl bromide, and N-ethylmaleimide inhibited phosphate incorporation into pp50 up to 90% without affecting incorporation into the other substrates. Vanadium pentoxide inhibited phosphorylation of CAP2 but had a minimal effect on pp50. CAP2 kinase activity was separated from the coated vesicle membrane and from dis-assembled clathrin triskelions, coeluting with the assembly polypeptide complex on a Sepharose 4B column. It retained phosphorylation properties similar to those of intact vesicles. These data imply that clathrin-coated vesicle kinases are elements of the coat proteins and may be involved in the assembly/disassembly of clathrin triskelions or interactions of coated vesicles with other cellular components.";polyarginine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
2888;3172222;Structural organization of the mouse cytosolic malate dehydrogenase gene: comparison with that of the mouse mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase gene.;We cloned and characterized a mouse cytosolic malate dehydrogenase (cMDHase) (EC 1.1.1.37) gene, which is about 14 x 10(3) base-pairs long and is interrupted by eight introns. The 5' and 3' flanking regions and the exact sizes and boundaries of the exon blocks, including the transcription-initiation sites, were determined. The 5' end of the gene lacks the TATA and CAAT boxes characteristic of eukaryotic promoters, but contains G + C-rich sequences, one putative binding site for a cellular transcription factor, Sp1, and at least two major transcription-initiation sites. The sequences around the transcription-initiation sites are compatible with the formation of a number of potentially stable stem-loop structures. We compared structural organization of the mouse cMDHase gene with that of the previously characterized mouse mitochondrial MDHase (mMDHase) gene, and found that the conservation of intron positions spreads across much of the two genes. This result suggests that a common ancestral gene for the cytosolic MDHase and the mitochondrial MDHase was broken up by introns, before the divergence. We also compared the nucleotide sequence of the promoter region of the mouse cytosolic MDHase gene with that of the other three mouse genes coding for isoenzymes participating in the malate-aspartate shuttle, i.e. mitochondrial MDHase, cytosolic and mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferases (cAspATase and mAspATase). We found that highly conserved regions are present in the promoter region of the cAspATase gene.;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

2893;21911377;Targeted translational regulation using the PUF protein family scaffold.;Regulatory complexes formed on mRNAs control translation, stability, and localization. These complexes possess two activities: one that binds RNA and another--the effector--that elicits a biological function. The Pumilio and FBF (PUF) protein family of RNA binding proteins provides a versatile scaffold to design and select proteins with new specificities. Here, the PUF scaffold is used to target translational activation and repression of specific mRNAs, and to induce specific poly(A) addition and removal. To do so, we linked PUF scaffold proteins to a translational activator, GLD2, or a translational repressor, CAF1. The chimeric proteins activate or repress the targeted mRNAs in Xenopus oocytes, and elicit poly(A) addition or removal. The magnitude of translational control relates directly to the affinity of the RNA-protein complex over a 100-fold range of K(d). The chimeric proteins act on both reporter and endogenous mRNAs: an mRNA that normally is deadenylated during oocyte maturation instead receives poly(A) in the presence of an appropriate chimera. The PUF-effector strategy enables the design of proteins that affect translation and stability of specific mRNAs in vivo. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

The latency of the three wavelets (P1, P2 and P3) was 6.8 +/- 0.6 ms (P1), 25.8 +/- 4.2 ms (P2) and 89.1 +/- 2.7 ms (P3) respectively, which might represent postsynaptic activity of different kinds of vagal afferent fibers. Microinjection of glutamate into ipsilateral locus coeruleus (LC) decreased the amplitude of P2 and P3 significantly. Electrical stimulation of LC could activate 111 units in ipsilateral NTS with a mean latency of 6.3 +/- 1.4 ms. Of the 169 units in the NTS to vagal afferent stimulation, 90 units also responded to LC stimulation. 39 (43.3%) of the ninety, units shows similar response to both stimuli, while the rest show different response. Of the 25 units which showed excitatory response to both LC and vagal stimulation, but when LC stimulation was followed by vagus stimulation, the latter's response was either markedly suppressed (14 units) or completely inhibited (11 units). These results showed that activation of LC exerts an inhibitory effect on the responses of the NTS to vagal afferent stimulation.;-;-;-;hard_0
2896;19083177;RNA-protein interaction mediating post-transcriptional regulation in the circadian system.;Post-transcriptional control makes an important contribution to shaping transcript profiles of circadianly regulated genes. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the clock-regulated glycine-rich RNA-binding protein ATGRP7 oscillates with a 24-h rhythm and transmits the rhythmicity generated by the central oscillator within the cell. ATGRP7 negatively auto-regulates its own expression at the post-transcriptional level. In response to an elevated protein level, a shift to a cryptic 5' splice site within the intron occurs, leading to an unproductively spliced transcript that rapidly vanishes due to its short half-life. This feedback regulation relies on direct binding of the RNA-binding protein to its own RNA. Here we describe the analysis of RNA-protein interaction in vitro employing recombinant RNA-binding protein and 32P-labelled in vitro transcripts or synthetic RNA oligoribonucleotides comprising the binding site under study. ;polyglycine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

BrdU-33258 Hoechst-Giemsa techniques were used to analyze and compare the late replication patterns in the 15q11.2q12 region between the homologs. Asynchronous replication between the homologs was observed in both amniocytes and fibroblasts. From cells of a marker 15 of known parental origin, the paternal 15q11.2q12 replicated earlier than that of the maternal 15 in 92%-95% of asynchronous metaphases. The remaining 5%-8% of asynchronous metaphases displayed maternal early/paternal late replication. This mosaic pattern of replication in the 15q11.2q12 region may be due to methylation mosaicism of genomic imprinting or a relative lack of self-control of replication. These results provide cytogenetic evidence of maternal imprinting and delayed replication in the 15q11.2q12 region.;-;-;-;hard_0

2906;28383716;Essential role for non-canonical poly(A) polymerase GLD4 in cytoplasmic polyadenylation and carbohydrate metabolism.;Regulation of gene expression at the level of cytoplasmic polyadenylation is important for many biological phenomena including cell cycle progression, mitochondrial respiration, and learning and memory. GLD4 is one of the non-canonical poly(A) polymerases that regulates cytoplasmic polyadenylation-induced translation, but its target mRNAs and role in cellular physiology is not well known. To assess the full panoply of mRNAs whose polyadenylation is controlled by GLD4, we performed an unbiased whole genome-wide screen using poy(U) chromatography and thermal elution. We identified hundreds of mRNAs regulated by GLD4, several of which are involved in carbohydrate metabolism including GLUT1, a major glucose transporter. Depletion of GLD4 not only reduced GLUT1 poly(A) tail length, but also GLUT1 protein. GLD4-mediated translational control of GLUT1 mRNA is dependent of an RNA binding protein, CPEB1, and its binding elements in the 3΄ UTR. Through regulating GLUT1 level, GLD4 affects glucose uptake into cells and lactate levels. Moreover, GLD4 depletion impairs glucose deprivation-induced GLUT1 up-regulation. In addition, we found that GLD4 affects glucose-dependent cellular phenotypes such as migration and invasion in glioblastoma cells. Our observations delineate a novel post-transcriptional regulatory network involving carbohydrate metabolism and glucose homeostasis mediated by GLD4. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

2916;2828172;In vitro binding of several cell-specific and ubiquitous nuclear proteins to the GT-I motif of the SV40 enhancer.;"We have investigated the specific in vitro binding of nuclear proteins from several cell lines to the GT-I motif of the SV40 enhancer which overlaps with the canonical enhancer ""core"" homology. The binding of three proteins (GT-IA, GT-IB, and GT-IC), one of which (GT-IC) exhibits cell specificity, was detected. Competition and direct binding experiments demonstrated that the two ubiquitous proteins also bind to the GC-rich motif III from the 21-bp repeat upstream element of the SV40 early promoter and that protein GT-IA is most probably the transcription factor Sp1. The third, cell-specific protein GT-IC exhibited a high affinity for both the GT-I motif and an upstream element in the promoter of the mouse beta-major-globin gene, suggesting that this protein can act both as an enhancer and an upstream element trans-acting factor. The good correlation between the known cell-specific in vivo activity of the wild-type and mutated GT-I motif and the cell-specific binding of protein GT-IC in vitro strongly supports the conclusion that this protein is an enhancer factor. Interestingly, its cognate recognition sequence does not coincide with the core homology.";polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
2922;6455676;Development of spontaneous motility in chick embryos. Further components of aminergic mechanisms.;The participation of central monoaminergic systems in the regulation of spontaneous motility in developing chick embryos was tested by systemic administration of several drugs, which affect the different sites of central aminergic systems. Amphetamine (2 mg.kg-1 egg weight) evoked an age-dependent depression of spontaneous motility, which first occurred in a significant fashion on day 13 of incubation. Two thirds of this depression depended upon supraspinal influences. The effect of p-chlorophenylalanine (100 mg.kg-1 e.w.) consisted from day 15 of incubation in a short-lasting depression followed by partial recovery of resting motility. alpha-methyldopa (100 mg.kg-1 e.w.) depressed the spontaneous motility from day 13 of incubation, without any signs of recovery within the first hour after drug administration. The most pronounced depressive effect was evoked by melatonin (25 mg.kg-1 e.w.) even in 11-day-old embryos. Along with the increased depth of depression the recovery of motility declined until full cessation of motility was achieved in 17-day-old embryos. The results were interpreted as constituting further evidence for the involvement of central aminergic systems in the development of supraspinal control over spontaneous motor activity generated by the CNS.;-;-;-;hard_0

No effect resulted from up to 3.0% mebendazole suspensions, but 3.0% levamisole solutions rapidly caused entry of microfilariae, straightening out and subsequent opacification of previously curled-up living microfilariae, the rapid formation of typical limbal globular infiltrates, and the subsequent formation of fluffy opacities around the microfilariae. These changes are typical of all other drugs so far studied that have a microfilaricidal action on O. volvulus--diethlycarbamizine citrate (DEC), suramin, and metrifonate. The efficacy of 3.0% levamisole approximated to that of 0.03% DEC. This is in keeping with published observations on the filaricidal activity of these 2 compounds.

2925;8752910;TCR triggering of anergic CD4 T cells in murine AIDS induces apoptosis rather than cytokine synthesis and proliferation.;Murine AIDS (MAIDS) induced by infection of C57BL/6 mice with a mixture of retroviruses known as LP-BM5 is characterized by lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and T and B cell dysfunction. By labeling with bromodeoxyuridine in vivo, we found vigorous CD4 T cell proliferation during the initial stages of infection, yet a loss in their ability to function both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, a significant fraction of the CD4 T cell population in infected mice undergoes spontaneous apoptosis in vivo. Upon in vitro stimulation with anti-CD3 plus PMA, anergic CD4 T cells from mice with MAIDS fail to progress through the cell cycle (G0/G1 arrest), and a fraction of the cells undergoes apoptosis. The addition of IL-2 along with TCR-mediated stimulation not only fails to rescue CD4 T cells from apoptosis, but enhances activation-induced cell death. To further understand the regulation of the suicide pathway(s) of anergic CD4 T cells vs the cytokine synthesis pathway(s) of normal CD4 T cells, we evaluated their expression of Bcl-2 protein. As infection progresses, the expression of Bcl-2 among CD4 T cells declines and drops further when CD4 T cells are restimulated through the TCR in vitro. These results suggest that this CD4 T cell immunodeficiency in MAIDS includes a TCR-induced program of activation-induced cell death and an uncoupling from cytokine synthesis pathways and proliferation of CD4 T cells. The decline in Bcl-2 expression may be in part responsible for this reprogramming.;-;-;-;hard_0
2926;20223753;Skeletal muscle-restricted expression of human SOD1 causes motor neuron degeneration in transgenic mice.;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease of motor neurons (MNs) that causes skeletal muscle paralysis. Familial forms of ALS are linked to mutations in the superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) gene. The mechanisms of human SOD1 (hSOD1) toxicity to MNs are unknown. We hypothesized that skeletal muscle is a primary site of pathogenesis in ALS that triggers MN degeneration. We created transgenic (tg) mice expressing wild-type-, G37R- and G93A-hSOD1 gene variants only in skeletal muscle. These tg mice developed age-related neurologic and pathologic phenotypes consistent with ALS. Affected mice showed limb weakness and paresis with motor deficits. Skeletal muscles developed severe pathology involving oxidative damage, protein nitration, myofiber cell death and marked neuromuscular junction (NMJ) abnormalities. Spinal MNs developed distal axonopathy and formed ubiquitinated inclusions and degenerated through an apoptotic-like pathway involving capsase-3. Mice expressing wild-type and mutant forms of hSOD1 developed MN pathology. These results demonstrate that human SOD1 in skeletal muscle has a causal role in ALS and identify a new non-autonomous mechanism for MN degeneration explaining their selective vulnerability. The discovery of instigating molecular toxicities or disease progression determinants within skeletal muscle could be very valuable for the development of new effective therapies for the treatment and cure of ALS.;-;-;-;hard_0
2928;8013239;Economic stress, coercive family process, and developmental problems of adolescents.;We propose a model of family conflict and coercion that links economic stress in family life to adolescent symptoms of internalizing and externalizing emotions and behaviors. The 180 boys and 198 girls in the study were living in intact families in the rural Midwest, an area characterized by economic decline and uncertainty. Theoretical constructs in the model were measured using both trained observer and family member reports. These adolescents and their parents were interviewed each year for 3 years during the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades. Our theoretical model proposes that economic pressure experienced by parents increases parental dysphoria and marital conflict as well as conflicts between parents and children over money. High levels of spousal irritability, coupled with coercive exchanges over money matters, were expected to be associated with greater hostility in general by parents toward their children. These hostile/coercive exchanges were expected to increase the likelihood of adolescent emotional and behavioral problems. Overall, results were consistent with the proposed model. Moreover, the hypothesized processes applied equally well to the behavior of mothers and fathers, as well as sons and daughters.;-;-;-;hard_0

Results indicate that acceptance ratings were not affected by the fat content or information about fat content when evaluated on nine-point scales. However, when asked to choose which cookie they liked better and to predict how many cookies they would eat (in forced-choice questions), fat content and information about fat content had a significant effect on cookie preference and prospective intake. When no information was available, subjects preferred the cookie with the higher fat content; when information was presented, subjects' preference shifted to the reduced-fat cookie. When asked which cookie they would choose to eat for dessert with hypothetical lunches, a similar shift in choice was observed following a low-fat lunch. The low-fat label was also associated with an increase in perceived healthiness relative to the high-fat label, as indicated on ""good for me"" scales. The effects of fat content information on cookie preference and prospective consumption were seen in pre-adolescents who indicated a ""high concern"" for the health consequences of dietary fat. Cookie preference and prospective intake of subjects who indicated a ""low concern"" were not affected by fat content labeling.

2934;19821777;Abdominal aortic calcification on vertebral morphometry images predicts incident myocardial infarction.;Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) measured on spine X-rays is an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease. We investigated whether AAC assessed using vertebral morphometry and a recently developed scoring system (AAC-8) is reliable and associated with cardiovascular risk factors or events. A total of 1471 healthy postmenopausal women and 323 healthy middle-aged and older men participated in 5 and 2 year trials of calcium supplements, respectively. AAC-8 was assessed on vertebral morphometry images at baseline and follow-up. In addition, 163 men also had coronary artery calcification measured using computed tomography. Cardiovascular events during the trials were independently adjudicated. We found strong inter- and intrameasurer agreement for AAC-8 (kappa > 0.87). The prevalence of AAC increased with age (p < .01) in women and in men. AAC was associated with many established cardiovascular risk factors, with serum calcium in women (p = .002) and with higher coronary calcium scores in men (p = .03). Estimated 5 year cardiovascular risk increased with increasing AAC-8 score (p < .001) in women and in men. The presence of AAC independently predicted myocardial infarction (MI) in women [hazards ratio (HR) = 2.30, p = .007] and men (HR = 5.32, p = .04), even after adjustment for estimated cardiovascular risk in women. In women, AAC independently predicted cardiovascular events (MI, stroke, or sudden death) (HR = 1.74, p = .007), and changes in AAC-8 score over time were associated with MI and cardiovascular events, even after adjustment for estimated cardiovascular risk. In summary, scoring AAC on vertebral morphometric scans is a reproducible method of assessing cardiovascular risk that independently predicts incident MI and cardiovascular events, even after taking into account traditional cardiovascular risk factors.;-;-;-;hard_0

Ten mammalian DGK isozymes have been identified to date. In addition to two or three cysteine-rich C1 domains (protein kinase C-like zinc finger structures) commonly conserved in all DGKs, these isoforms possess a variety of regulatory domains of known and/or predicted functions, such as a pair of EF-hand motifs, a pleckstrin homology domain, a sterile alpha motif domain, a MARCKS (myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate) phosphorylation site domain and ankyrin repeats. Recent studies have revealed that DGK isozymes play pivotal roles in a wide variety of mammalian signal transduction pathways conducting growth factor/cytokine-dependent cell proliferation and motility, seizure activity, immune responses, cardiovascular responses and insulin receptor-mediated glucose metabolism. It is suggested that several DGK isozymes can serve as potential drug targets for cancer, epilepsy, autoimmunity, cardiac hypertrophy, hypertension and type II diabetes. Unfortunately, there are no DGK isozyme-specific inhibitors/activators at present. Development of these compounds is eagerly awaited for the development of novel drugs targeting DGKs. ;polycysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function

In preliminary experiments, the effects of several doses of caffeine were examined in the three in order to obtain some indication of the doses to use for interaction experiments. Therefore, stimulant doses of caffeine (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) were associated with the two benzodiazepines. It was found that BDZ counteracted the effect of caffeine in the hole-board and in the spontaneous motor activity tests. By contrast, in the open-field situation, the association always gave rise to an increase in exploration activity. Furthermore, the present investigations showed, once again, that chlor-desmethyldiazepam is more active than the other benzodiazepine.;-;-;-;hard_0

2954;18631359;Phosphorylation of the arginine/serine dipeptide-rich motif of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nucleocapsid protein modulates its multimerization, translation inhibitory activity and cellular localization.;Coronavirus nucleocapsid protein is abundant in infected cells and participates in viral RNA replication and transcription. The central domain of the nucleocapsid protein contains several arginine/serine (RS) dipeptides, the biological significance of which has not been well investigated. In the present study, we demonstrate that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nucleocapsid protein is phosphorylated primarily within the RS-rich region in cells and by SR protein kinase 1 in vitro. The nucleocapsid protein could suppress translation and its RS motif is essential for such an activity. Moreover, phosphorylation of the RS motif could modulate the translation inhibitory activity of the nucleocapsid protein. We further found that RS motif phosphorylation did not significantly affect RNA binding of the nucleocapsid protein but impaired its multimerization ability. We observed that the nucleocapsid protein could translocate to cytoplasmic stress granules in response to cellular stress. Deletion or mutations of the RS motif enhanced stress granule localization of the nucleocapsid protein, whereas overexpression of SR protein kinase 1 inhibited nucleocapsid protein localization to stress granules. The nucleocapsid protein lacking the RS motif formed high-order RNP complexes, which may also account for its enhanced stress granule localization. Taken together, phosphorylation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV nucleocapsid protein modulates its activity in translation control and also interferes with its oligomerization and aggregation in stress granules. ;polyserine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
2955;9383567;Discovering antisense reagents by hybridization of RNA to oligonucleotide arrays.;Antisense reagents have the potential to modify gene expression by interacting with DNA or mRNA to down-regulate transcription or translation. There have been a number of successful demonstrations of antisense activity in vivo. However, a number of problems must be solved before the method's full potential can be realized. One problem is the need for the antisense agent to form a duplex with the target molecule. We have found that most regions of mRNAs are not open to duplex formation with oligonucleotides because the bases needed for Watson-Crick base pairing are involved in intramolecular pairing. Using arrays of oligonucleotides that are complementary to extensive regions of the mRNA target, we are able to find those antisense oligonucleotides which bind optimally. There is good correspondence between the ability of an oligonucleotide to bind to its target and its activity as an antisense agent in in vivo and in vitro tests. To understand more fully the rules governing the process of duplex formation between a native RNA and complementary oligonucleotides, we have studied the interactions between tRNAphe and a complete set of complementary dodecanucleotides. Only four of the set of 65 oligonucleotides interact strongly. The four corresponding regions in the tRNA share structural features. However, other regions with similar features do not form a duplex. It is clear that ab initio prediction of patterns of interaction require much greater knowledge of the process of duplex formation than is presently available.;-;-;-;hard_0
2958;10784611;Glycine-rich cell wall proteins act as specific antigen targets in autoimmune and food allergic disorders.;Our objective was to investigate the presence of a B and T cell immune response directed against the glycine-rich cell wall protein (GRP) in patients with different autoimmune disorders and with food allergy. GRP is an ubiquitous food protein that has high homology with cytokeratins and other self proteins [Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-I), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein, fibrillar collagen] which are common targets in autoimmune disorders. A peptide (GGYGDGGAHGGGYGG) derived from GRP was used to screen human sera in direct and competitive ELISA assay. Anti-GRP-specific IgG were analyzed for their ability to cross-react with autoantigens. The intracellular cytokine profiles of the peptide-specific T cell clones obtained from representative patients have been studied. BALB/c mice were immunized with the peptide coupled to the carrier protein keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). Serum IgG antibodies directed against the GRP peptide were detected in several autoimmune disorders and in food allergic patients, and were able to cross-react with autoantigens including keratin, collagen and EBNA-I. Twenty-five T cell clones showed a specific proliferative response to the GRP peptide and were of the T(h)0 phenotype. Eight of the 10 BALB/c mice immunized with the peptide coupled to KLH developed an autoimmune response. Our data suggest that phylogenetically highly conserved epitopes in plants, viruses and humans may be responsible for an autoimmune response in susceptible individuals. They also indicate that the antigen spreading of a particular sequence among apparently divergent proteins may participate to initiate or amplify an immune response. ;polyglycine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
2959;8601451;In vitro activation and substrates of recombinant, baculovirus expressed human protein kinase C mu.;To study enzymatic activity and activation conditions of the recently identified novel protein kinase C mu (PKC mu) subtype, epitope tagged PKC mu was propagated in the baculovirus expression system and was purified to homogeneity. PKC mu displays high affinity phorbol ester binding (Kd=7 nM) resulting in enhanced phosphatidylserine-dependent kinase activity. From various lipid second messengers known to activate PKCs only diacylglycerol and PtdIns-4,5-P2, were found to promote PKC mu kinase activity. Two peptides derived from the glycogen synthase, GS-peptide and syntide 2, were found to be phosphorylated efficiently in vitro. MARCKS (myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate) served as an in vitro substrate for PKC mu too. However, in contrast to other PKCs, a peptide derived from the MARCKS phosphorylation domain is phosphorylated only at serine 156, and not at serines 152 and 163, implicating a differential regulation by PKC mu.; polyalanine ;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
2970;1851878;Herpes simplex virus origin-binding protein (UL9) loops and distorts the viral replication origin.;To investigate the role of the herpes simplex virus origin-binding protein (UL9) in the initiation of DNA replication, we have examined the effect of UL9 binding on the structure of the viral origin of replication. UL9 loops and alters the DNA helix of the origin regardless of the phasing of the binding sites. DNase I and micrococcal nuclease footprinting show that UL9 binds two sites in the origin and loops the AT-rich DNA between them independent of the topology of the DNA. KMnO4 and dimethyl sulfate footprinting further show that UL9 alters the DNA helix in the AT region. In contrast to the looping reaction, however, helical distortion requires the free energy of supercoiled DNA. UL9 also loops and distorts the origin DNA of a replication-defective mutant with a 6-bp insertion in the AT region. Because the helical distortion of this mutant DNA is different from that of functional origins, we conclude that an imperfect tertiary structure of the mutant DNA may contribute to its loss of replication function.;polythreonine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
2971;7143213;Binding of selected phenol derivatives to human serum proteins.;The binding of phenol and four of its derivatives to whole human serum and several human serum proteins was investigated. 14C-labeled derivatives were utilized and binding was studied by either equilibrium or dynamic dialysis. Phenol itself was bound least to most of the serum proteins as compared to the derivatives and albumin, and whole human serum exhibited the highest percent binding of the proteins used. Percent binding to albumin and serum paralleled molecular weights of the derivatives, but not definite pattern was observed in ranking the percent binding of the other derivatives to the other serum proteins. Binding constants (K1, K2, n1 and n2) were determined from Scatchard plots for all the derivatives except p-chloro-m-xylenol. Phenol was found to have the highest association constant (K1) and p-tert-amylphenol, the lowest. For the entire group of five derivatives and albumin as the protein, a direct, statistically significant correlations was found between percent binding and Hansch pi values. No correlation was found with Hammett sigma values. It is concluded that binding of the phenol derivatives to albumin involves primarily hydrophobic bonds.;-;-;-;hard_0

2977;34723157;Maturation trajectories and transcriptional landscape of plasmablasts and autoreactive B cells in COVID-19.;In parasite and viral infections, aberrant B cell responses can suppress germinal center reactions thereby blunting long-lived memory and may provoke immunopathology including autoimmunity. Using COVID-19 as model, we set out to identify serological, cellular, and transcriptomic imprints of pathological responses linked to autoreactive B cells at single-cell resolution. We show that excessive plasmablast expansions are prognostically adverse and correlate with autoantibody production but do not hinder the formation of neutralizing antibodies. Although plasmablasts followed interleukin-4 (IL-4) and BAFF-driven developmental trajectories, were polyclonal, and not enriched in autoreactive B cells, we identified two memory populations (CD80+/ISG15+ and CD11c+/SOX5+/T-bet+/-) with immunogenetic and transcriptional signs of autoreactivity that may be the cellular source of autoantibodies in COVID-19 and that may persist beyond recovery. Immunomodulatory interventions discouraging such adverse responses may be useful in selected patients to shift the balance from autoreactivity toward long-term memory.;-;-;-;hard_0
2979;11278371;Two domains of the human bZIP transcription factor TCF11 are necessary for transactivation.;TCF11 is a bZIP transcription factor of the CNC subfamily. It has been implicated in the regulation of the antioxidant response and is vital during embryonic development, but its precise biological functions have not yet been fully worked out. Structural characterization of the gene and several of its products indicates that complex regulatory mechanisms are employed. To investigate how altering the structure of the gene products might influence their activity we have mapped functional domains within the protein. We show that two separate domains are required for transactivation by full-length TCF11: an N-terminal acidic domain and a serine-rich stretch adjacent to the CNC-bZIP domains. A naturally occurring shorter isoform (identical to LCR-F1) produced by internal initiation of translation is unable to transactivate in our assay. However, the shorter form could interfere with the transactivating ability of the longer form, which indicates a control mechanism for keeping the activity of TCF11 at a desired level. We show that TCF11 and the closely related CNC-bZIP factor p45 NF-E2 show different cell type-specific activation patterns with full-length TCF11 being active in COS-1 cells but silent in erythroid cells (K562), whereas p45 NF-E2 is active in K562 cells and silent in COS-1 cells. Domain swapping experiments show that cell type-specific activity is not fully determined by dimerization/DNA binding domains or transactivation domains alone. The resulting profile of activity is most likely achieved by interaction of the domains and their cell-specific environment. ;polyserine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
2983;8226143;Radiation therapy alone for stage I non-small cell lung cancer.;"PURPOSE
This paper is a retrospective analysis of patients with clinical Stage I non-small cell carcinoma of the lung treated with definitive radiation therapy alone. The results of therapy, patterns of failure and the relationship of technical aspects of the delivery of radiotherapy to outcome are presented.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
From 1980 through 1990, 53 patients with Stage I non-small cell lung cancer were treated with definitive radiation therapy alone at the Radiation Oncology Center of the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology and its affiliated hospitals. All patients had a pathologic diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer and were not candidates for surgical resection because of either patient refusal (10 patients), poor performance status (5 patients), or premorbid medical problems (38 patients). The median age was 73 years. Histologic cell type included squamous (32), adenocarcinoma (11), large cell (4), and unclassified non-small cell (6). Initial tumor size was < or = 3 cm in 23 patients, between 3 and 5 cm in 13 patients and > or = 5 cm in 17 patients. Diagnostic staging varied during the study period. All patients had chest X-rays and computed tomography scans of the chest. A majority had liver and bone scans, but only four underwent mediastinoscopy. The radiation therapy was of megavoltage energy in all patients, with a median primary prescription tumor dose of 63.2 Gy. Survival was measured from the date radiation therapy was initiated.


RESULTS
The actuarial overall survival rate for the entire group was 19% at 3 years and 6% at 5 years, with a median survival time of 20.9 months. Of the 49 deaths, 35 died of lung cancer; 13 died of intercurrent illness, and one died of pancreatic cancer, which made the actuarial cause-specific survival 33% at 3 years and 13% at 5 years. The actuarial 3-year disease-free survival was 33%. Local primary tumor progression occurred in 22 patients, resulting in a 51% 3-year actuarial freedom from local progression. An additional four patients failed in regional lymph nodes that were included in the original treatment portals. Multivariate analysis found only T stage to be associated with overall survival (p = .02). However multivariate analysis showed age as a prognostic factor to be approaching statistical significance (p = .07). Patients under 70 years of age showed an increased survival rate compared to patients over 70 years. Radiation therapy doses > or = 65 Gy appeared to result in a decreased proportion of patients dying of lung cancer with no apparent increase in either acute or long-term complication rates.


CONCLUSION
Results of definitive radiation therapy for inoperable Stage I non-small cell lung remain inferior to surgical therapy. Potential methods to improve local control with radiotherapy are discussed.";-;-;-;hard_0
2984;1976316;Characterization of the mouse 84-kD heat shock protein gene family.;The nucleotide sequence of a 6-kb region containing the gene for mouse 84-kD heat shock protein, HSP84, was determined. The hsp84 gene codes for a 5,500-base transcript and consists of 11 exons and 10 introns, ranging in length from 94 to 357 bp and 85 to 1,271 bp, respectively. One of the exons codes for a stretch of highly charged amino acids with two known phosphorylation sites. The presence of numerous introns in the hsp84 gene suggests that synthesis of the HSP84 protein would be precluded during severe heat shock, since such conditions interfere with splicing. The first intron, which is the largest, is located at the exact boundary between the 5'-untranslated region and the coding region and contains a sequence homologous to the heat shock element (HSE), an enhancer that is a characteristic feature of heat-inducible genes. A 71% homology was found between a 569-bp stretch within the first intron of the hsp84 gene, which includes the HSE-like sequence, and a portion of the first intron of the previously reported sequence of the human hsp89 beta gene. The promoter region of the hsp84 gene contained G + C-rich upstream sequences, potential binding sites for transcription factor Sp1, and a canonical TATA box. The hsp84 gene family includes at least six different hsp84-related pseudogenes, which arose about 2-3 million years ago.;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
2985;19656898;Role for G-quadruplex RNA binding by Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 in DNA replication and metaphase chromosome attachment.;Latent infection by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) requires both replication and maintenance of the viral genome. EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) is a virus-encoded protein that is critical for the replication and maintenance of the genome during latency in proliferating cells. We have previously demonstrated that EBNA1 recruits the cellular origin recognition complex (ORC) through an RNA-dependent interaction with EBNA1 linking region 1 (LR1) and LR2. We now show that LR1 and LR2 bind to G-rich RNA that is predicted to form G-quadruplex structures. Several chemically distinct G-quadruplex-interacting drugs disrupted the interaction between EBNA1 and ORC. The G-quadruplex-interacting compound BRACO-19 inhibited EBNA1-dependent stimulation of viral DNA replication and preferentially blocked proliferation of EBV-positive cells relative to EBV-negative cell lines. BRACO-19 treatment also disrupted the ability of EBNA1 to tether to metaphase chromosomes, suggesting that maintenance function is also mediated through G-quadruplex recognition. These findings suggest that the EBNA1 replication and maintenance function uses a common G-quadruplex binding capacity of LR1 and LR2, which may be targetable by small-molecule inhibitors. ;polyglycine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

The enzymatic activity of the superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, showed a significant increase, while the lipid peroxide content was found to decrease to a large extent in MRE and indomethacin-treated rats. There was also significant and concentration-dependent increase in the percentage inhibition of DPPH, comparable to that of vitamin E and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) which are natural and synthetic antioxidants, respectively. The results obtained in the present study indicate that MRE possesses free radical scavenging and antioxidant properties.;-;-;-;hard_0
2989;17125272;Synthesis and biological evaluation of new asymmetrical bisintercalators as potential antitumor drugs.;The good results obtained in the past decade with various types of potential bisintercalating agents, e.g., LU 79553, DMP 840, BisBFI, MCI3335, WMC-26, BisAC, BisPA, and the asymmetrical derivative WMC-79 (Chart 1), prompted us to investigate a new series of asymmetrical bisintercalators, compounds 1a-t (Chart 2), which can combine the potentiality of bisintercalation with a possible different mechanism of action due to two diverse chromophores. The DNA-binding properties of these compounds have been examined using fluorometric techniques: target compounds are excellent DNA ligands, with a clear preference for binding to AT-rich duplexes. In vitro cytotoxicity of these derivatives toward human hormone-refractory prostate adenocarcinoma cell line (PC-3) is described. Apoptosis assays of four selected compounds are also reported. Very potent cytotoxic compounds, some of them capable of inducing early apoptosis, have been identified. ;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
3000;9302669;In-situ simulation of one-piece metacarpophalangeal joint implants using finite element analysis.;Generally, reconstruction of the rheumatoid metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint is achieved by means of implantation of a hinged silastic prosthesis. Whereas these implants restore some degree of mobility to the joint, they are prone to failure after a relatively short life-span, and little is known about their dynamical behaviour within the joint. In this study, the Swanson and Sutter designs of MCP implant were examined in an idealized joint environment by means of two-dimensional finite element analysis. The purpose was to assess how the differing geometry affected their behaviour as replacement joints, and whether they were inherently prone to abrasion and high stress concentrations during flexion. The results revealed the changing points of contact between the implant and the bone ends, and clearly showed the implant stems 'pistoning' in the intramedullary canals. This was found to be an effective way to provide preliminary information on the dynamic behaviour of an implant in a simulated joint. This would facilitate further optimization of design in advance of fabrication.;-;-;-;hard_0
3005;2839687;Antigenicity, function, and conformation of synthetic oligopeptides corresponding to amino-terminal sequences of wild-type and mutant matrix proteins of vesicular stomatitis virus.;"The matrix (M) protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) has a major antigenic determinant (epitope 1) that maps to a region extending from amino acids 19 through 43 and transcription-inhibition activity that maps to the first 43 N-terminal amino acids (J.R. Ogden, R. Pal, and R. R. Wagner, J. Virol. 58:860-868, 1986). The M protein of temperature-sensitive mutant tsO23(III) is devoid of epitope 1 and transcription-inhibition activity and substitutes glutamic acid for glycine at amino acid 21 as well as having amino acid substitutions at positions 111 and 227 (K. Morita, R. Vanderoef, and J. Lenard, J. Virol. 61:256-263, 1987). We undertook to map more precisely epitope 1 and the transcription-inhibition region of VSV M protein by means of synthetic oligopeptides generated by an automated solid-phase protein synthesizer. A pentadecapeptide designated PI(wt, Gly21), corresponding to amino acids 17 to 31 of wild-type (wt) M protein, strongly bound monoclonal antibody MAb2 (directed to epitope 1); however, an analogous pentadecapeptide with glutamic acid substituted for glycine at position 21, designated PII(tsO23, Glu21), completely failed to recognize MAb2. Polyclonal antibody raised in rabbits immunized with PI(wt, Gly21) reacted strongly with wt M protein, the homologous pentadecapeptide, and, to a lesser extent, PII(tsO23, Glu21). Anti-PII(tsO23, Glu21) failed to recognize PI(wt, Gly21) or wt M protein. Anti-PI(wt, Gly21) competed efficiently for binding of MAb2 to wt M protein and was as effective as MAb2 in reversing inhibition of VSV transcription by wt M protein. Neither PI(wt, Gly21) nor PII(tsO23, Glu21) exhibited any ability to inhibit VSV transcription. However, a lysine-rich oligopeptide, PII(Met1-Leu20), corresponding to the first 20 N-terminal amino acids of wt M protein, and polylysine itself did inhibit VSV transcription, albeit much less efficiently than native wt M protein. Monospecific polyclonal antibody directed to the 20-mer oligopeptide PIII(Met1-Leu20) reversed transcription inhibition by M protein in a dose-dependent manner almost identical to that of anti-PI(wt, Gly21) and epitope 1-specific MAb2. Examination by circular dichroism spectropolarimetry revealed significant differences in the conformation of the two pentadecapeptides attributable to the Gly in equilibrium Glu amino acid substitution at position 21.";polylysine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
3007;9666093;Modulation of human alpha1(I) procollagen gene activity by interaction with Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors in vitro.;"In previous work, we delineated a proximal region of the human alpha1(I) collagen gene (COL1A1) promoter necessary to direct its basal transcription in fibroblasts. This region has potential recognition sites for a variety of DNA-binding proteins. Here, we show that the -129/-107-bp sequence in this region of the promoter, which harbors an inverted CCAAT motif closely linked to a GC-rich direct repeat and is perfectly conserved between mouse and human, specifically bound the transcription factors Sp1, Sp3, and CTF/NF-1 in nuclear extracts from human skin and lung fibroblasts. Drosophila Schneider L2 cells lacking endogenous Sp activity were used to investigate the effect of expression of Sp or CTF/NF-1 transcription factors on COLlAl promoter activity. Expression of Sp1 caused potent trans-activation of a COL1A1 promoter (-174 to +42bp). In contrast, expression of Sp3, which binds to the same recognition sites as Sp1, and CTF/NF-1 stimulated COL1A1 promoter activity only at higher concentrations, and Sp2 did not transactivate. Expression of a 10-fold excess of Sp3, but not CTF/NF-1 or Sp2, abrogated the stimulation of COL1A1 promoter activity induced by Sp1. TGF-beta at concentrations previously shown to increase COL1A1 transcription caused a decrease in the relative amount of Sp3 in fibroblast nuclear extracts. These results suggest that both Sp1 and Sp3 bind to the proximal COL1A1 promoter and stimulate its activity; however, their interaction with each other may result in repression of Sp1-induced COL1A1 transcription. Alterations in the relative amounts or DNA-binding activities of these transcription factors in a cell- or signal-specific manner may contribute to the control of transcription from the COL1A1 promoter. The present findings, and recent observations implicating Sp1 and its homologs in regulating the expression of several collagen genes, suggest that the family of Sp1 transcription factors play a role in physiological and pathological modulation of connective tissue accumulation.";polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
3011;17330285;Cooperative propagation of local stability changes from low-stability and high-stability regions in a SH3 domain.;Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to produce local stability changes at two regions of the binding site surface of the alpha-spectrin SH3 domain (Spc-SH3) differing in their intrinsic stability. Mutations were made at residue 56, located at the solvent-exposed side of the short 3(10) helix, and at residue 21 in the tip of the flexible RT-loop. NMR chemical-shift analysis and X-ray crystallography indicated negligible changes produced by the mutations in the native structure limited to subtle rearrangements near the mutated residue and at flexible loops. Additionally, mutations do not alter importantly the SH3 binding site structure, although produce significant changes in its affinity for a proline-rich decapeptide. The changes in global stability measured by differential scanning calorimetry are consistent the local energy changes predicted by theoretical models, with the most significant effects observed for the Ala-Gly mutations. Propagation of the local stability changes throughout the domain structure has been studied at a per-residue level of resolution by NMR-detected amide hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HX). Stability propagation is remarkably efficient in this small domain, apparently due to its intrinsically low stability. Nevertheless, the HX-core of the domain is not fully cooperative, indicating the existence of co-operative subunits within the core, which is markedly polarized. An equilibrium phi-analysis of the changes in the apparent Gibbs energies of HX per residue produced by the mutations has allowed us to characterize structurally the conformational states leading to HX. Some of these states resemble notably the folding transition state of the Spc-SH3 domain, suggesting a great potential of this approach to explore the folding energy landscape of proteins. An energy perturbation propagates more effectively from a flexible region to the core than in the opposite direction, because the former affects a broader region of the energy landscape than the latter. This might be of importance in understanding the special thermodynamic signature of the SH3-peptide interaction and the relevance of the dual character of SH3 binding sites. ;polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function

3020;11823120;"Linkage of boronated polylysine to glycoside moieties of polyclonal antibody; boronated antibodies as potential delivery agents for neutron capture therapy.";Among the ways to deliver comparatively large amounts of boron to cells in vitro for boron neutron capture studies is the linkage of a boronated macromolecule such as polylysine to an antibody. In order to reduce interference with immunoreactivity, boronated polylysine (BPL) was linked to oligosaccharide moieties on the IgG molecule distant from the antibody combining sites. The resultant bioconjugate was chromatographically separated from free BPL and unconjugated antibody using a Sephacryl S300 column. The total measured boron per BPL-IgG conjugate, determined by direct current plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, was estimated to be approximately 6 x 10(3) atoms. This, together with molecular weight estimations, indicated conjugation of about 3 polylysines to each IgG molecule. Immunoreactivity of the conjugate was found to be the same as that of the unconjugated polyclonal antibody. This was based on its concentration dependent interference with immunometric reactions for an antigen (TSH), whereas heat inactivated or non-specific antibody had no such inhibitory effects. The results support the hypothesis that the binding affinity of the conjugate for antigen was preserved after its linkage to BPL under the conditions described. The methodology described in this report may have applicability for the preparation of boronated antibodies as delivery agents for BNCT. ;polylysine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
3021;3186731;A signal peptide encoded within the precore region of hepatitis B virus directs the secretion of a heterogeneous population of e antigens in Xenopus oocytes.;Using synthetic hepatitis B virus (HBV) mRNAs, we have shown that expression of HBV core-antigen gene sequences in Xenopus oocytes leads to the stable accumulation of 21-kDa cytoplasmic core protein (P21). In contrast, expression of precore plus core sequences leads mainly to the secretion of a heterogeneous population of proteins ranging in size from 15 to 22 kDa that collectively display viral e antigen (HBeAg) activity. We demonstrate that the precore region contains a cleavable 19 amino acid signal peptide that targets the precore proteins to the secretory pathway. The initial product of translocation (P22) is further processed during migration through the secretory pathway, apparently by a series of cleavage events at the arginine-rich carboxyl terminus, to yield multiple proteins of 15-18 kDa (P15-P18) that are secreted along with some P22. Our results indicate that serum HBeAg is generated by a signal peptide-mediated secretion event dependent on precore sequences. ;polyarginine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

Crystal structures of several peptide natural products, peptaibols, have revealed predominantly helical conformations, despite the presence of multiple helix-breaking Pro or Hyp residues. Survey of synthetic Aib-containing peptides shows a preponderance of 3(10)-, alpha-, and mixed 3(10)/alpha-helical structures. This review highlights the examples of Aib residues observed in nonhelical conformations, which fall 'primarily' into the polyproline II (P(II)) and fully extended regions of conformational space. The achiral Aib residue can adopt both left (alpha(L))- and right (alpha(R))-handed helical conformations. In sequences containing chiral amino acids, helix termination can occur by means of chiral reversal at an Aib residue, resulting in formation of a Schellman motif. Examples of Aib residues in unusual conformations are illustrated by surveying a database of Aib-containing crystal structures. ;polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function
3023;27598772;Targeting polyIC to EGFR over-expressing cells using a dsRNA binding protein domain tethered to EGF.;Selective delivery of drugs to tumor cells can increase potency and reduce toxicity. In this study, we describe a novel recombinant chimeric protein, dsRBEC, which can bind polyIC and deliver it selectively into EGFR over-expressing tumor cells. dsRBEC, comprises the dsRNA binding domain (dsRBD) of human PKR (hPKR), which serves as the polyIC binding moiety, fused to human EGF (hEGF), the targeting moiety. dsRBEC shows high affinity towards EGFR and triggers ligand-induced endocytosis of the receptor, thus leading to the selective internalization of polyIC into EGFR over-expressing tumor cells. The targeted delivery of polyIC by dsRBEC induced cellular apoptosis and the secretion of IFN-β and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. dsRBEC-delivered polyIC is much more potent than naked polyIC and is expected to reduce the toxicity caused by systemic delivery of polyIC.  ;polyisoleucine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

In the poly(A) X oligo(U) X Et complex, a new peak about 2.0 ppm downfield from the double-helix peak appears. We have assigned this peak to phosphates perturbed by ethidium. The chemical shift of this peak is consistent with the intercalation mode of binding and provides additional support for our hypothesis that 31P shifts are sensitive probes of phosphate ester conformations. The main effect of ethidium on the 31P spectra of tRNAPhe is the broadening of several of the scattered signals. These scattered signals are associated with phosphates involved in tertiary interactions. We propose that these broadened signals arise from phosphates near the Et binding site.; polyalanine ;helix;-;LCR_with_function
3028;33556087;Low immunogenicity of common cancer hot spot mutations resulting in false immunogenic selection signals.;Cancer is driven by somatic mutations that result in a cellular fitness advantage. This selective advantage is expected to be counterbalanced by the immune system when these driver mutations simultaneously lead to the generation of neoantigens, novel peptides that are presented at the cancer cell membrane via HLA molecules from the MHC complex. The presentability of these peptides is determined by a patient's MHC genotype and it has been suggested that this results in MHC genotype-specific restrictions of the oncogenic mutational landscape. Here, we generated a set of virtual patients, each with an identical and prototypical MHC genotype, and show that the earlier reported HLA affinity differences between observed and unobserved mutations are unrelated to MHC genotype variation. We demonstrate how these differences are secondary to high frequencies of 13 hot spot driver mutations in 6 different genes. Several oncogenic mechanisms were identified that lower the peptides' HLA affinity, including phospho-mimicking substitutions in BRAF, destabilizing tyrosine mutations in TP53 and glycine-rich mutational contexts in the GTP-binding KRAS domain. In line with our earlier findings, our results emphasize that HLA affinity predictions are easily misinterpreted when studying immunogenic selection processes.;polyglycine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
3033;2458104;Molecular cloning and characterization of novel prostate antigen cDNA's.;Three different prostate antigen cDNA's were isolated from a PC 82 prostate tumor cDNA library. PA 75 has a size of 1.4 kb and contains the almost complete information for the 35 kD prostate antigen preproprotein. The 1.6 kb PA 525 cDNA lacks about 0.2 kb of the 3'-non coding region and contains an additional internal 0.4 kb fragment as a result of alternative splicing. PA 424 represents a 0.6 kb variant of PA 75. It contains a 0.15 kb internal fragment and a poly(A) tail preceded by an AAGAAA motive at the 3'-end. The predicted protein products of PA 525 and PA 424 will be different from PA 75 at the C-terminal end. In RNA preparations of two human prostate tumors (PC 82 and PC EW) seven different prostate antigen transcripts can be detected ranging in size from 0.5 kb to 5.6 kb. PA 75 cDNA represents the major 1.5 kb mRNA. PA 424 correlates with a 0.9 kb transcript and PA 525 with a 1.9 kb mRNA species.; polyalanine ;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
3034;3427055;Calcium binding domains and calcium-induced conformational transition of SPARC/BM-40/osteonectin, an extracellular glycoprotein expressed in mineralized and nonmineralized tissues.;SPARC, BM-40, and osteonectin are identical or very closely related extracellular proteins of apparent Mr 43,000 (Mr 33,000 predicted from sequence). They were originally isolated from parietal endoderm cells, basement membrane producing tumors, and bone, respectively, but are rather widely distributed in various tissues. In view of the calcium binding activity reported for osteonectin, we analyzed the SPARC sequence and found two putative calcium binding domains. One is an N-terminal acidic region with clusters of glutamic acid residues. This region, although neither gamma-carboxylated nor homologous, resembles the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain of vitamin K dependent proteins of the blood clotting system in charge density, size of negatively charged clusters, and linkage to the rest of the molecule by a cysteine-rich domain. The other region is an EF-hand calcium binding domain located near the C-terminus. A disulfide bond between the E and F helix is predicted from modeling the EF-hand structure with the known coordinates of intestinal calcium binding protein. The disulfide bridge apparently serves to stabilize the isolated calcium loop in the extracellular protein. As observed for cytoplasmic EF-hand-containing proteins and for Gla domain containing proteins, a major conformational transition is induced in BM-40 upon binding of several Ca2+ ions. This is accompanied by a 35% increase in alpha-helicity. A pronounced sigmoidicity of the dependence of the circular dichroism signal at 220 nm on calcium concentration indicates that the process is cooperative. In view of its properties, abundance, and wide distribution, it is proposed that SPARC/BM-40/osteonectin has a rather general regulatory function in calcium-dependent processes of the extracellular matrix.;polycysteine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
3037;8268720;Molecular organization of the rat glia-derived nexin/protease nexin-1 promoter.;The first three exons and the promoter of rat glia-derived nexin, also called protease nexin-1 (GDN/PN-1), have been identified through analysis of rat genomic clones. A 1.6 kilobase (kb) fragment containing 105 base pairs of the first exon and 5'-flanking sequences was sequenced. The 5'-flanking sequence and the first exon were found to be GC-rich, indicating that the 5' region of the rat GDN/PN-1 gene resides within a CpG island. A TATA box-like sequence, but no CAAT box, was found. The rat GDN/PN-1 promoter contains five SP1 consensus sites, four consensus sites for the MyoD1 transcription factor, and one binding site for the transcription factors NGFI-A, NGFI-C, Krox-20, and Wilms tumor factor. The presence of these consensus sequences is consistent with the known expression pattern of GDN/PN-1. Primer extension and RNase protection assays identified one transcriptional start site. The 1.6 kb promoter fragment cloned in a reporter plasmid was found to induce firefly luciferase expression in a cell-specific manner. A positive regulatory element is localized in the region -1545 to -389.

3038;7963838;[Thrombolytic therapy of thrombosed Björk-Shiley aortic valve prosthesis--report of four cases].;Prosthetic valve thrombosis is associated with high mortality. Thrombolytic therapy is a promising alternative to valve replacement in the management of prosthetic valve thrombosis. To determine the efficacy and safety of thrombolytic therapy for thrombosed Björk-Shiley aortic valve prosthesis, 4 patients who received urokinase intravenously for this disorder were analyzed. In 3 patients, the successful outcome was sustained in that they remained asymptomatic and did not require operative intervention during follow-up, which ranged from 17 to 101 months. In one patient clinical signs of mild congestive heart failure occurred. This patient was surgically treated by thrombectomy and debridement of the prosthetic valve. Failure of urokinase treatment to resolve the thrombus after 1 week indicates that tissue overgrowth or fibrous, organized thrombus is the cause of prosthetic malfunction. Surgical intervention for this problem should be considered only after thrombolytic therapy has been tried and has failed. Our experience with urokinase treatment of thrombosis of aortic Björk-shiley prostheses indicates that this form of treatment should always be applied before surgical intervention. We also attempted to define the optimum protocol of fibrinolytic therapy by clinical evaluation. A protocol for the safe treatment of thrombosed valve is urokinase in initially administered in the doses as 960,000 units for 24 hours, then followed by a maintenance infusion at the half dose every 24 or 48 hours later. Thrombolytic therapy should be continued for 1 week at least to prevent rethrombosis even normalization of valve function was documented clinically. Simultaneous heparin infusion of 10,000 units for 24 hours is then started to replaced by warfarin treatment adjusted to obtain optimal prothrombin times.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS);-;-;-;hard_0

3046;8178560;Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS): are common bacterial toxins responsible, and do they have a vaccine potential?;Despite extensive research, no unifying concept has satisfactorily explained the cause of the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The details are briefly outlined of some of the evidence supporting the hypothesis that common bacterial toxins are important in the aetiology of SIDS. These bacterial toxins act as triggers to initiate a biochemical cascade resulting in death. Data from four research groups, each working independently, indicated that the bacteria Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. were present in higher numbers in infants who had suffered SIDS than in control infants. Certainly more detailed studies need to be performed on the role of bacterial infections in infants. There are many implications arising from this work, particularly the use of vaccination as a means of reducing infections, and consequently the number of SIDS deaths.;-;-;-;hard_0
3049;9020109;Sp3 is a bifunctional transcription regulator with modular independent activation and repression domains.;Sp3 is a member of the Sp family of transcription factors and binds to DNA with affinity and specificity comparable to that of Sp1. We demonstrate that Sp3 is a bifunctional transcription factor that can both activate and repress transcription. Gene fusion experiments in mammalian cells demonstrate that the Sp3 activation potential is distributed over an extensive glutamine-rich N-terminal region, whereas the repressor activity has been mapped in a 72-amino acid region located at the 5' of the zinc finger DNA-binding domain. We demonstrated that the repression activity is strictly dependent on the context of the DNA-binding sites bound by Sp3. We found that Sp3 represses transcription of promoters bearing multiple GAL4 DNA-binding sites, whereas it activates isogenic reporters containing a single GAL4-binding site. Transfection experiments in Drosophila cells that lack endogenous Sp activity demonstrated that Sp3 does not possess an active repression domain that can function in insect cells, rather it is a weak transcriptional activator of the c-myc promoter. Our results strongly suggest that Sp3 is a dual-function regulator whose activity is dependent upon both the promoter and the cellular context. ;polyglutamine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function

Cortical CBF was measured using the hydrogen clearance technique in enflurane-anesthetized rats, and local [K+]e was measured with K+ microelectrodes adjacent to the hydrogen electrode. Eucapnic hypoxia (arterial Po2 approximately 35-40 Torr) increased CBF twofold and caused a modest rise in [K+]e (from 2.9 +/- 0.2 to 3.7 +/- 0.2 mM; mean arterial blood pressure, ABP, 86 +/- 5 mmHg). If ABP fell < 70 mmHg during hypoxia, no increase in CBF was seen, whereas [K+]e increased to > 20 mM. Glibenclamide (10-100 microM intracortically) attenuated [K+]e and CBF during hypoxia (ABP approximately 75 mmHg, P < 0.01). Ouabain (20-1,000 microM) increased [K+]e; however, it did not remove the hypoxic-induced rise in [K+]e. We conclude that glibenclamide-sensitive potassium channels contribute to the accumulation of [K+]e during hypoxia, although an increase in CBF during hypoxia can occur without a marked rise in [K+]e. Furthermore, if ABP falls below the lower limit of autoregulation during hypoxia, there is no increase in CBF, yet there is a large increase in [K+]e.";-;-;-;hard_0
3058;6092346;Structure of the human gamma-fibrinogen gene. Alternate mRNA splicing near the 3' end of the gene produces gamma A and gamma B forms of gamma-fibrinogen.;The gamma chain of human fibrinogen exists in 2 nonallelic forms, gamma A and gamma B, which differ only in their carboxyl termini. We have found that only one genomic locus exists for gamma-fibrinogen and that the gamma A and gamma B chains arise by alternate mRNA splicing near the 3' end of this gene. In contrast to the rat gamma B mRNA which is produced by alternate splicing with identical polyadenylation sites, human gamma B is produced when the eighth intervening sequence remains unspliced and a polyadenylation signal within this intron is used. The new carboxyl terminus is 16 amino acids longer than the gamma A protein, and although there is only minimal homology between the rat and human carboxyl termini they share a very high proportion of acidic amino acids.;-;-;-;hard_0

The locomotor activity of adult flies from these cultures was monitored in either LL or DD. Flies that were reared and tested in DD had a lower proportion of individuals with normal circadian rhythms than flies reared in LD or LL and tested in DD. The activity rhythms of DD-reared DD-tested animals, when present, showed phase coherence within two out of seven populations, while 8 out of 10 LL-reared DD-tested showed phase coherence. Flies tested in LL were largely devoid of circadian rhythms regardless of their rearing environment. Ultradian rhythms were more evident under conditions disruptive to circadian rhythmicity, but were observed in the presence and absence of circadian rhythms. The periods of the ultradian rhythms of LL-reared DD-tested and LD-reared DD-tested flies varied significantly among genotypes, while in other rearing and testing regimes, no relationship was found.;-;-;-;hard_0

This immunogen was then used to generate antibodies which demonstrate good cross-reactivity to d-propoxyphene, d-norpropoxyphene, and other propoxyphene metabolites. In addition, these antibodies were shown to have very low cross-reactivity to methadone, a structurally related compound. The introduction of an aminomethyl benzoate spacer into the propoxyphene active ester (2), followed by the activation of the carboxylic acid, provided for a more stable active ester (5). This stable active ester, together with the antibodies generated from the propoxyphene immunogen, has led to the development of an immunoassay based on the Kinetic Interaction of Microparticles in Solution (KIMS).;-;-;-;hard_0
3061;8069931;Regulation of intracellular polymorphonuclear leukocyte Fc receptors by lipopolysaccharide.;"Endotoxemia, in man, has been associated with an autooxidative reduction in the bioavailability of polymorphonuclear leukocyte receptors. The location and mechanisms of this phenomena have remained unclear; we investigated the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on intracellular Fc gamma receptor expression. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were incubated with LPS (10 ng/ml), permeabilized with saponin, followed by measurement of CD64, CD32w, and CD16 (Fc gamma RI, II, III) using 125I-monoclonal antibodies directed against these receptors. Exposure of permeabilized PMN to LPS significantly reduced intracellular Fc gamma receptor expression. PMN isolated from patients with chronic granulomatous disease or myeloperoxidase-specific deficiency did not exhibit this effect. Furthermore, specific inhibitors of components of the PMN oxidative burst (NaN3, 10 mM; L-alanine 30 mM) prevented the LPS-induced oxidative reduction in receptor expression. NADPH oxidase inhibition with diphenyleneiodonium also blocked the effect of LPS on intracellular Fc gamma receptor expression. The effects of LPS on intracellular PMN Fc gamma receptors were reproduced with monophosphoryl lipid A but required a 10 times greater concentration than LPS. Preadherence of PMN on fibronectin or arginine-glycine-aspartate-serine (RGDS), but not laminin, prevented the LPS-induced reduction in oxidative receptor expression. The effects of fibronectin/RGDS were blocked by actinomycin D and cycloheximide. Cross-linkage of intracellular Fc gamma receptors prior to exposure to LPS also prevented the LPS-induced oxidative reduction in receptor expression. These results demonstrate that an important pathophysiologic property of LPS is to induce an intracellular oxidative-derived reduction in Fc gamma receptor expression and that the biologically relevant proteins fibronectin and RGDS ameliorate this effect.";-;-;-;hard_0
3063;7479029;TFE3 contains two activation domains, one acidic and the other proline-rich, that synergistically activate transcription.;"TFE3 is a basic-helix-loop-helix-zipper (bHLHZIP) domain-containing protein that binds mu E3 sites in regulatory elements in the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene. The protein is a transcriptional activator that is expressed in vivo as two alternately spliced isoforms with different activating properties: TFE3L contains an N-terminal acidic activation domain; TFE3S lacks this activation domain and is a dominant negative inhibitor of TFE3L. We show that TFE3L and TFE3S contain a second, C-terminal activation domain rich in proline residues. This pro-rich activation domain has activity in a Gal4 fusion assay comparable to the N-terminal acidic activation domain present in TFE3L. The TFE3 pro-rich activation domain contains regions of strong homology with the related proteins microphthalmia and TFEB, suggesting that these regions are important for function. Using two different assays, we show that the N- and C-terminal activation domains of TFE3 act synergistically. This synergism explains in part the ability of TFE3S to act as a dominant negative. Our domain analysis of TFE3 is incorporated into a general structural model for the TFE3 protein that predicts that the activation domains of TFE3 will be widely separated in space.";polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function
3064;8937568;Specific quantitation of genomic DNA in the femtogram range by amplification of repetitive sequences.;An assay was developed to specifically quantitate concentrations as low as 50 fg/ml genomic DNA based on the amplification of repetitive sequences. Reliable results were obtained by using internal standard molecules which were coextracted, coamplified, and coanalyzed with the nucleic acids of interest. Amplification was performed by the polymerase chain reaction in the presence of fluorescent dye-labeled primers followed by quantitation of fluorescence derived from the reaction products after separation by PAGE. Based on the known amount of added internal standard molecules and the intensities of the fluorescence of the reaction products, the primary results of the assay were obtained as copies per milliliter of sample. These were converted into mass units of DNA by applying an experimentally determined conversion factor. Chicken DNA has been used as an example for genomic DNA, and the sequences amplified were CR1 repetitive elements. This type of assay may be applied in cases where a sensitive and precise quantitation of genomic DNA is required, such as in the quality control of biological products.;-;-;-;hard_0

There are no simple relations between electrocortical and electrodermal parameters, but patients display more significant correlations between these two sets of variable than controls.

We examined the mechanism by which influenza virus causes PMN dysfunction by measuring the effect upon the chemiluminescent activity of cells of varying the type of influenza virus used, the period of time that cells were exposed to virus, and the secondary stimulus that was used. The various types of intact influenza virus elicited different amounts of chemiluminescent activity, but when cells were subsequently stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate, each virus caused equivalent depression of the PMN response. Purified glycoproteins incorporated into a liposome structure similarly stimulated the PMN chemiluminescence, yet did not induce PMN dysfunction. Depressed PMN function was noted after as little as 5 min of incubation of cells with virus and occurred to both receptor-dependent (zymosan, N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, and phorbol myristate acetate) and -independent (calcium ionophore A23187) stimuli.;-;-;-;hard_0
3072;18354787;Binding of protoberberine alkaloid coralyne with double stranded poly(A): a biophysical study.;Recognition of double stranded ribonucleic acid is a critical event in many biological pathways such as trafficking, editing and maturation of mRNA, interferon antiviral response and RNA interference. In the context of probing double stranded RNA binding small molecules, the interaction of the antitumor protoberberine alkaloid coralyne with double stranded poly(A) has been studied by various biophysical techniques. Typical hypochromic and bathochromic shifts in the absorption spectrum and appreciable quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of coralyne indicated the strong affinity of coralyne to poly(A). The corresponding intrinsic binding constant evaluated from Scatchard analysis was in the order of 10(5) M(-1). The strong binding was further characterized by significant polarization of the alkaloid fluorescence and stabilization of poly(A) helix against thermal strand separation. The binding process was manifested by remarkable perturbation of the intrinsic circular dichroic spectrum of poly(A) with concomitant generation of optical activity in the bound alkaloid molecules that are otherwise achiral. Job plot analysis showed the binding stoichiometry of the interaction process to be two base pairs per alkaloid molecule. The energetics of the strong interaction was studied by isothermal titration and differential scanning calorimetric techniques that suggested the binding to be exothermic and favoured by both negative enthalpy and positive entropy changes. All these results, together with the Stern-Volmer quenching experiment in fluorescence, revealed the molecular details of the intercalation of coralyne into poly(A) duplex leading to its potential use as an agent in gene regulation in eukaryotic cells. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
3077;22895175;LIN54 harboring a mutation in CHC domain is localized to the cytoplasm and inhibits cell cycle progression.;The mammalian LIN complex (LINC) plays important roles in regulation of cell cycle genes. LIN54 is an essential core subunit of the LINC and has a DNA binding region (CHC domain), which consists of two cysteine-rich (CXC) domains separated by a short spacer. We generated various LIN54 mutants, such as CHC deletion mutant, and investigated their subcellular localizations and effects on cell cycle. Wild-type LIN54 was predominantly localized in the nucleus. We identified two nuclear localization signals (NLSs), both of which were required for nuclear localization of LIN54. Interestingly, deletion of one CXC domain resulted in an increased cytoplasmic localization. The cytoplasmic LIN54 mutant accumulated in the nucleus after leptomycin B treatment, suggesting CRM1-mediated nuclear export of LIN54. Point mutations (C525Y and C611Y) in conserved cysteine residues of CXC domain that abolish DNA binding activity also increased cytoplasmic localization. These data suggest that DNA binding activity of LIN54 is required for its nuclear retention. We also found that LIN54 (C525Y) and LIN54 (C611Y) inhibited cell cycle progression and led to abnormal nuclear morphology. Other CXC mutants also induced similar abnormalities in cell cycle progression. LIN54 (C525Y) led to a decreased expression of some G2/M genes, whose expressions are regulated by LINC. This cell cycle inhibition was partially restored by overexpression of wild-type LIN54. These results suggest that abnormal cellular localization of LIN54 may have effects on LINC activity. ;polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Whether NH4+-independent salt effects could be neutralized by adding nonammoniacal salts to control samples in lieu of deionized water was also investigated. Because the levels of exchangeable endogenous NH4+ were very low in the three soils, desorption of endogenous NH4+ was not a significant factor in this study. The Km(app) values for water-treated controls were 9.8, 22, and 57 nM for temperate pine, temperate hardwood, and birch taiga soils, respectively. At CH4 concentrations of </=15 &mgr;l liter-1, oxidation followed first-order kinetics in the fine-textured taiga soil, whereas the coarse-textured temperate soils exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Compared to water controls, the Km(app) values in the temperate soils increased in the presence of NH4+ salts, whereas the Vmax(app) values decreased substantially, indicating that there was a mixture of competitive and noncompetitive inhibition mechanisms for whole NH4+ salts. Compared to the corresponding K+ salt controls, the Km(app) values for NH4+ salts increased substantially, whereas the Vmax(app) values remained virtually unchanged, indicating that NH4+ acted by competitive inhibition. Nonammoniacal salts caused inhibition to increase with increasing CH4 concentrations in all three soils. In the birch taiga soil, this trend occurred with both NH4+ and K+ salts, and the slope of the increase was not affected by the addition of NH4+. Hence, the increase in inhibition resulted from an NH4+-independent mechanism. These results show that NH4+ inhibition of atmospheric CH4 oxidation resulted from enzymatic substrate competition and that additional inhibition that was not competitive resulted from a general salt effect that was independent of NH4+.";-;-;-;hard_0

In the I-band region of the sarcomere, where titin extends and develops passive force upon stretch, titin is composed of tandem repeats of approximately 100 residue immunoglobin domains and approximately 28-residue PEVK modules. We have performed 2D NMR and circular dichroism (CD) studies of the conformations of one representative 28-mer PEVK module from human fetal titin (PEPPKEVVPEKKAPVAPPKKPEVPPVKV). NMR data of synthetic peptides of this module as well as three constituent peptides of 9 to 12 residues in aqueous solutions reveal distinguishing features for left-handed three-residue per turn PPII helices: the lack of NOE NN(i, i+1), very large NOE alphaN(i, i+1)/NN(i, i+1), no medium range NOE alphaN(i, i+2), and dihedral angles phi and psi values of -78 and 146, respectively. Structural determinations indicate the presence of three short stretches of PPII helices of 4, 5, and 6 residues that are interposed with an unordered, and presumably flexible, spacer region to give one ""polyproline II helix-coil"" or ""PhC"" motif for roughly every 10 residues. These peptides also display the characteristic PPII CD spectra: positive peak or negative shoulder band at 223 nm, negative CD band near 200 nm, and biphasic thermal titration curves that reflect varied stability of these PPII helices. We propose that this PhC motif is a fundamental feature and that the number, length, stability, and distribution of PPII is important in the understanding of the elasticity and protein interactions of the PEVK region of titin.

In this context the relationship between health care professionals and patients also become an indispensable tool in clinical situations to achieve better patient outcomes (Engel, 1990). In our pilot study in year 2009 we try to verify how are the medical students and students of health care (University of Maribor, Faculty of Medicine and Faculty of Health Care) prepared for their sensitive professional relationship in their future.

Several histological and clinical risk factors have been associated with a higher risk of local relapse; however, the exact pathogenetic mechanisms that regulate the local recurrence of these tumors are still to be elucidated. The serine and arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1) is an RNA-binding protein whose oncogenic function has been described in numerous forms of human cancers, including brain, lung, and prostate tumors. We evaluated the correlation between SRSF1 immunoexpression and the local recurrence of BCCs. Materials and Methods: Fifty-two cases of surgically excised BCCs with free-tumor margins (10 high-risk and 42 low-risk variants), for which follow-up data were available, were selected. Local recurrence occurred in only 5 cases. Results: We found high and low immunoexpressions of SRSF1 in 18 and 34 cases, respectively. A statistically significant association between high SRSF1 immunoexpression and the local recurrence of BCC was found (p = 0.0433).

Although deletion of the proline-rich domain does not affect transactivation of several promoters, such as WAF1, MDM2 and BAX, it does alter transcriptional repression, reactive oxygen species production and sequence-specific transactivation of the PIG3 gene, and these are activities which affect apoptosis. Whereas gel retardation assays revealed that this domain did not alter in vitro the specific binding to the p53-responsive element of PIG3, this domain plays a critical role in transactivation from a synthetic promoter containing this element. To explain this discrepancy, evidence is given for a proline-rich domain-mediated cellular activation of p53 DNA binding. ;polyproline;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

This subset of patients, which may be regarded as having an idiopathic cough, are often female and of peri or postmenopausal age. Sex hormones may influence the cough reflex in disease or contribute to the chronic lymphocytic airway inflammation seen in some cases and to the association with organ specific autoimmune disease reported. This paper seeks to investigate some of the possible causes of idiopathic cough.;-;-;-;hard_0
3102;8114090;A DNA minor groove-binding ligand both potentiates and arrests transcription by RNA polymerase II. Elongation factor SII enables readthrough at arrest sites.;RNA polymerase II encounters various obstacles to transcript elongation both in vivo and in vitro. These include DNA sequence elements and protein bound to the major groove of DNA. Elongation factor SII binds to RNA polymerase II and enables the enzyme to bypass these impediments. SII also activates nascent RNA cleavage by the arrested transcription elongation complex, an activity intimately involved in the readthrough process. Here we identify another type of reversible blockage to RNA polymerase II transcription, the antitumor antibiotic distamycin, which binds in the minor groove of A + T-rich DNA. SII facilitates readthrough of arrest sites resulting from DNA-binding of the drug. In response to SII, these complexes cleave their nascent RNA chains. These findings confirm that SII is a general elongation factor that potentiates transcription through a variety of impediments. They also strengthen the idea that SII stimulates transcription by activating nascent RNA cleavage. In some cases, distamycin can potentiate transcription through a naturally occurring pause site. We also show that the template undergoes a conformational change in the presence of distamycin. This suggests that distamycin can transform DNA from an elongation-non-permissive configuration into an elongation-permissive form and we take this as independent evidence confirming that DNA structure influences transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II.;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
3103;8277409;Surgical treatment of induced peri-implantitis in the micro pig: clinical and histological analysis.;The purpose of this pilot study was to determine if lost osseous support adjacent to root form implants could be regenerated using a guided tissue regeneration technique. Three fixtures were placed in each edentulous mandibular bicuspid region of two micro pigs. A total of 6 fixtures were placed in each pig. Due to the presence of a pathologic condition, which was in no way related to the research, the results of one pig were not evaluated. Following osseointegration, peri-implantitis were induced by the use of ligatures and a soft diet. Three modalities of treatment were performed. Utilizing a surgical flap approach, one third of the fixtures (one per quadrant) were covered with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membrane and submerged under the soft tissue complex. The second group of fixtures were submerged under the soft tissue complex with no ePTFE membrane. The control fixtures along with their abutments were debrided and remained non-submerged. All fixtures were debrided using an air-abrasive polishing system. The osseous defects around the fixtures were measured from a fixed reference point at the time of surgery and after obtaining block sections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS);-;-;-;hard_0
3104;18385933;Topiramate in the prevention of pediatric migraine: literature review.;Pediatric migraine is a disabling condition, which can cause a significant impact on quality of life. Currently, no drugs have been approved by the FDA for its preventive treatment. Our aim was to review the medical literature concerning the efficacy and tolerability of topiramate in the prophylactic treatment of migraine in children and adolescents. A total of five papers were reviewed: two randomized controlled trials (RCTs), a post-hoc subset analysis of adolescents who had been included in three RCTs carried out on adults and two open studies. Topiramate has been proven to reduce headache frequency and the accompanying disability. The frequency of side effects varied considerably among studies, the most frequent being weight loss, anorexia, abdominal pain, difficulties in concentrating, sedation and paresthesia. Since these adverse events, although often transitory, may be distressing for the child, we strongly recommend to assess the disability caused by the migraine episodes before deciding to initiate a prophylactic treatment. Nevertheless, dropout rates due to side effects in the studies were very low.;-;-;-;hard_0
3108;8856040;Inhibition of copper- and peroxyl radical-induced LDL lipid oxidation by ebselen: antioxidant actions in addition to hydroperoxide-reducing activity.;The effects of ebselen (2-phenyl-1,2-benzisoselenazol-3(2H)-one) on human LDL lipid oxidation induced by different fluxes of aqueous peroxyl radicals and cupric ion (at a Cu2+:LDL ratio of 17:1) were investigated. Addition of ebselen to LDL oxidised with Cu2+ prolonged the duration of the lag-phase typical for this oxidising condition, with the increase being proportional to the square of the ebselen concentration. Ebselen also prevented the formation of lipid hydroperoxides and inhibited the consumption of endogenous antioxidants during the early period of Cu(2+)-induced oxidation, during which time the drug was converted stoichiometrically into ebselen oxide (2-phenyl-1,2-benzisoselenazol-3(2H)-one-Se-oxide). Ebselen oxide itself was antioxidant inactive. Ebselen also inhibited formation of lipid-hydroperoxides and spared alpha-tocopherol during the initial stages of LDL oxidation mediated by low-flux of aqueous peroxyl radicals, where a lag-phase was not observed. When a higher flux of aqueous peroxyl radicals was used, ebselen increased the observed inhibited phase of peroxidation in a dose-dependent manner, though less pronounced than its prolongating effect on the lag-phase of Cu(2+)-induced LDL lipid oxidation. Ebselen was also able to directly interact with Cu1+, alkyl peroxyl radicals and alpha-tocopheroxyl radicals, demonstrating that the drug has a number of potential antioxidant activities in addition to its well-known hydroperoxide-reducing activity. We conclude that the antioxidant activities of ebselen are complex and that their relative importance likely vary depending on the experimental system used.;-;-;-;hard_0
3109;19424961;Identification of a human estrogen receptor alpha-derived antiestrogenic peptide that adopts a polyproline II conformation.;Polyproline II (PPII) helix is an extended secondary structure present in a number of proteins. PPII-containing sequences mediate specific protein-protein interactions with partners containing appropriate cognate domains called PPII-recognizing domains (PRDs) and are involved in the activation of intracellular signaling pathways. Thus, the identification of PPII structures in proteins is of great interest, not only to explore molecular and physiological mechanisms, but also to elaborate new potential drugs. By revisiting X-ray crystal structures of liganded alpha-type human estrogen receptor (ERalpha), we have identified an 11-residue PPII-helical sequence (D(321)AEPPILYSEY(331)) in the ligand-binding domain of the receptor. The data recorded by far-ultraviolet circular dichroism (far-UV CD), vibrational Raman optical activity (ROA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) show that the corresponding peptide (Ac-DAEPPILYSEY-NH(2)) is particularly well structured in PPII, with the same proportion of PPII as observed from X-ray structures (approximately 85%). In addition, studies carried out on ERalpha-negative Evsa-T breast cancer cells transiently co-transfected with a pcDNA3-ERalpha plasmid and a Vit-tk-Luc reporter gene revealed that the peptide antagonizes the estradiol-induced transcription providing perspectives for researching new molecules with antagonistic properties. ;polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function
3111;19156829;A strained DNA binding helix is conserved for site recognition, folding nucleation, and conformational modulation.;"Nucleic acid recognition is often mediated by alpha-helices or disordered regions that fold into alpha-helix on binding. A peptide bearing the DNA recognition helix of HPV16 E2 displays type II polyproline (PII) structure as judged by pH, temperature, and solvent effects on the CD spectra. NMR experiments indicate that the canonical alpha-helix is stabilized at the N-terminus, while the PII forms at the C-terminus half of the peptide. Re-examination of the dihedral angles of the DNA binding helix in the crystal structure and analysis of the NMR chemical shift indexes confirm that the N-terminus half is a canonical alpha-helix, while the C-terminal half adopts a 3(10) helix structure. These regions precisely match two locally driven folding nucleii, which partake in the native hydrophobic core and modulate a conformational switch in the DNA binding helix. The peptide shows only weak and unspecific residual DNA binding, 10(4)-fold lower affinity, and 500-fold lower discrimination capacity compared with the domain. Thus, the precise side chain conformation required for modulated and tight physiological binding by HPV E2 is largely determined by the noncanonical strained alpha-helix conformation, ""presented"" by this unique architecture.

3112;8641176;T lymphocytes play a critical role in the development of cyclosporin A-induced osteopenia.;"The T lymphocyte suppressor, cyclosporin A, has been shown to cause high turnover osteoporosis. We postulated that cyclosporin A may exert its effects via the T cell rather than direct activity on bone. In this study we administered cyclosporin A (15 mg/kg.day by gavage) to 11 10-week-old Rowett athymic nude rats and to 12 age-matched immunocompetent Sprague-Dawley rats. Placebo was administered to control groups (n = 12 for both). After 28 days of treatment, the Sprague-Dawley rats displayed high turnover bone loss, but the nude rats were largely unaffected by the drug. Sprague-Dawley treated rats had less than half the percent trabecular area of their controls as measured at the secondary spongiosa of the proximal tibial metaphysis (P < 0.001; strain by treatment, P = 0.007). The same pattern was evident for trabecular number, separation, and thickness (strain by treatment, P = 0.034, P = 0.001, and P = 0.021, respectively). Only the Sprague-Dawley rats had an elevated percent eroded perimeter and an elevated bone area referent bone formation rate (strain by treatment, P = 0.002 and P = 0.0003, respectively). Mass, glucose, ionized calcium, PTH, osteocalcin, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and creatinine all responded similarly to cyclosporin A regardless of strain. T Lymphocytes thus appear to be a prerequisite for the development of cyclosporin A-induced osteopenia.";-;-;-;hard_0
3113;29515234;PARP10 suppresses tumor metastasis through regulation of Aurora A activity.;ADP-ribosylation, including poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) and mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation), is a multifunctional post-translational modification catalyzed by intracellular ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTDs or PARPs). Although PARylation has been investigated most thoroughly, the function of MARylation is currently largely undefined. Here, we provide evidences that deficiency of PARP10, a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase, markedly increased the migration and invasion of tumor cells through regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and PARP10 inhibited tumor metastasis in vivo, which was dependent on its enzyme activity. Mechanistically, we found that PARP10 interacted with and mono-ADP-ribosylated Aurora A, and inhibited its kinase activity, thereby regulating its downstream signaling. Moreover, the expression level of PARP10 was downregulated in intrahepatic metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared with its corresponding primary HCC and adjacent non-tumorous tissues. Taken together, our results indicated that PARP10 has an important role in tumor metastasis suppression via negatively regulation of Aurora A activity. ;polyalanine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
3122;31458388;A Solution NMR Approach To Determine the Chemical Structures of Carbohydrates Using the Hydroxyl Groups as Starting Points.;"An efficient NMR approach is described for determining the chemical structures of the monosaccharide glucose and four disaccharides, namely, nigerose, gentiobiose, leucrose and isomaltulose. This approach uses the 1H resonances of the -OH groups, which are observable in the NMR spectrum of a supercooled aqueous solution, as the starting point for further analysis. The 2D-NMR technique, HSQC-TOCSY, is then applied to fully define the covalent structure (i.e., the topological relationship between C-C, C-H, and O-H bonds) that must be established for a novel carbohydrate before proceeding to further conformational studies. This process also leads to complete assignment of all 1H and 13C resonances. The approach is exemplified by analyzing the monosaccharide glucose, which is treated as if it were an ""unknown"", and also by fully assigning all the NMR resonances for the four disaccharides that contain glucose. It is proposed that this technique should be equally applicable to the determination of chemical structures for larger carbohydrates of unknown composition, including those that are only available in limited quantities from biological studies. The advantages of commencing the structure elucidation of a carbohydrate at the -OH groups are discussed with reference to the now well-established 2D-/3D-NMR strategy for investigation of peptides/proteins, which employs the -NH resonances as the starting point.";-;-;-;hard_0
3123;9632137;Subcellular localization of the oncoprotein MTG8 (CDR/ETO) in neural cells.;"The t(8;21) translocation associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) disrupts two genes, the AML1 gene also known as the core binding factor A2 (CBFA2) on chromosome 21, and a gene on chromosome 8, hereafter referred to as MTG8, but also known as CDR and ETO. Extensive information is available on AML1, a member of the CBF family of transcription factors, containing a highly conserved domain, the runt box, of the Drosophila segmentation gene runt. This gene is essential for the hematopoietic development and is found disrupted in several leukemias. In contrast, the function of the MTG8 gene is poorly understood. The predicted protein sequence shows two unusual, putative zinc-fingers, three proline-rich regions, a PEST domain and several phosphorylation sites. In addition, we found a region encompassing aa 443-514 predicted to have a significant propensity to form coiled coil structures. MTG8 displays a high degree of similarity with nervy, a homeotic target gene of Drosophila, expressed in the nervous system. Human and mouse wild-type MTG8 are also highly expressed in brain relative to other tissues. For these reasons, we set out to investigate the expression and subcellular localization of the MTG8 protein in neural cells. Immunohistochemical experiments in a 12.5-day-old mouse embryo clearly showed that the protein was expressed in the neural cells of the developing brain and the spinal cord. In primary cultures of hippocampal neurons of 2-3 day-old mice, MTG8 was found in the nucleus, in the cytoplasm and as fine granules in the neurites. Cytoplasmic localization of the protein was observed in Purkinje cells of both human and mouse cerebellum. The molecular mass of MTG8 in total human and mouse brain was analysed by immunoblotting and determined to be between 70 and 90 kDa. Isoforms with the same molecular mass were demonstrated in synaptosomes isolated from mouse forebrain. The evidence of MTG8 in the nucleus and cytoplasm of neural cells suggests a specific mechanism regulating the subcellular localization of the protein.";polyproline;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
3126;11468283;Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase A associates with F-actin and dendritic spines via its N terminus.;The consequences of the rapid 3-phosphorylation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) to produce inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP(4)) via the action of IP(3) 3-kinases involve the control of calcium signals. Using green fluorescent protein constructs of full-length and truncated IP(3) 3-kinase isoform A expressed in HeLa cells, COS-7 cells, and primary neuronal cultures, we have defined a novel N-terminal 66-amino acid F-actin-binding region that localizes the kinase to dendritic spines. The region is necessary and sufficient for binding F-actin and consists of a proline-rich stretch followed by a predicted alpha-helix. We also localized endogenous IP(3) 3-kinase A to the dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons in primary hippocampal cultures, where it is co-localized postsynaptically with calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Our experiments suggest a link between inositol phosphate metabolism, calcium signaling, and the actin cytoskeleton in dendritic spines. The phosphorylation of IP(3) in dendritic spines to produce IP(4) is likely to be important for modulating the compartmentalization of calcium at synapses. ;polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function
3131;8039498;A complex of GRB2-dynamin binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 after insulin treatment.;Insulin drives the formation of a complex between tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 and SH2-containing proteins. The SH2-containing protein Grb2 also possesses adjacent SH3 domains, which bind the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos. In this report, we examined the involvement of another SH3 binding protein, dynamin, in insulin signal transduction. SH3 domains of Grb2 as GST fusion proteins bound dynamin from lysates of CHO cells expressing wild-type insulin receptor (IR) (CHO-IR cells) in a cell-free system (in vitro). Immunoprecipitation studies using specific antibodies against Grb2 revealed that Grb2 was co-immunoprecipitated with dynamin from unstimulated CHO-IR cells. After insulin treatment of CHO-IR cells, anti-dynamin antibodies co-immunoprecipitated the IR beta-subunit and IRS-1, as tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and PI 3-kinase activity. However, purified rat brain dynamin did not bind directly to either the IR, IRS-1 or the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase in vitro. Together, these results suggest that in CHO-IR cells, insulin stimulates the binding of dynamin to tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 via Grb2 and that IRS-1 also associates with PI 3-kinase in response to insulin. This complex formation was reconstituted in vitro using recombinant baculovirus-expressed IRS-1, GST-Grb2 fusion proteins and dynamin peptides containing proline-rich sequences. Furthermore, dynamin GTPase activity was found to be stimulated when an IRS-1-derived phosphopeptide, containing the Grb2 binding site, was added to the dynamin-Grb2 complex in vitro.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS);polyproline;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
3133;17619986;Effect of silicon on the formation of silk fibroin/calcium phosphate composite.;The silk fibroin/calcium phosphate composites were prepared by adding the different amount of Na(2)SiO(3) to assess the effect of silicon on the HA (hydroxyapatite) formation in the composites. FTIR and XRD results suggested that the inorganic phase was constituted mainly by the amorphous DCPD (dicalcium phosphate dehydrate), a precursor of HA in the bone mineral, when the composites were prepared at the final Na(2)SiO(3) concentration lower than 0.008%. Otherwise, HA was formed as the predominant one in the as-prepared composite, accompanied with a conformational transition in the organic phase of silk fibroin protein from silk I (alpha-helix and/or polyglycine II (3(1)-helix) conformations) to silk II (antiparallel beta-sheet conformation). SEM images showed the different morphologies with the samples, i.e., sheet-like crystals in the composites prepared at a low Na(2)SiO(3) concentration and rod-like bundles in other composites. The rod-like bundles were connected together to form the porous network, due to the fact that the HA crystals grew with the aggregation of silk fibroin, and further accreted onto the silk fibroin fibrils. TG curves indicated that the composites prepared with a certain amount of additional SiO (3) (2-) had the higher thermal stability because of its high molecular orientation and crystallinity, and high water-holding capacity due to the porous microstructure. ;polyglycine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
3137;7903399;Detecting frame shifts by amino acid sequence comparison.;Various amino acid substitution scoring matrices are used in conjunction with local alignments programs to detect regions of similarity and infer potential common ancestry between proteins. The usual scoring schemes derive from the implicit hypothesis that related proteins evolve from a common ancestor by the accumulation of point mutations and that amino acids tend to be progressively substituted by others with similar properties. However, other frequent single mutation events, like nucleotide insertion or deletion and gene inversion, change the translation reading frame and cause previously encoded amino acid sequences to become unrecognizable at once. Here, I derive five new types of scoring matrix, each capable of detecting a specific frame shift (deletion, insertion and inversion in 3 frames) and use them with a regular local alignments program to detect amino acid sequences that may have derived from alternative reading frames of the same nucleotide sequence. Frame shifts are inferred from the sole comparison of the protein sequences. The five scoring matrices were used with the BLASTP program to compare all the protein sequences in the Swissprot database. Surprisingly, the searches revealed hundreds of highly significant frame shift matches, of which many are likely to represent sequencing errors. Others provide some evidence that frame shift mutations might be used in protein evolution as a way to create new amino acid sequences from pre-existing coding regions.;-;-;-;hard_0

3144;23813793;Impact of hydrostatic pressure on an intrinsically disordered protein: a high-pressure NMR study of α-synuclein.;"The impact of pressure on the backbone (15) N, (1) H and (13) C chemical shifts in N-terminally acetylated α-synuclein has been evaluated over a pressure range 1-2500 bar. Even while the chemical shifts fall very close to random coil values, as expected for an intrinsically disordered protein, substantial deviations in the pressure dependence of the chemical shifts are seen relative to those in short model peptides. In particular, the nonlinear pressure response of the (1) H(N) chemical shifts, which commonly is associated with the presence of low-lying ""excited states"", is much larger in α-synuclein than in model peptides. The linear pressure response of (1) H(N) chemical shift, commonly linked to H-bond length change, correlates well with those in short model peptides, and is found to be anticorrelated with its temperature dependence. The pressure dependence of (13) C chemical shifts shows remarkably large variations, even when accounting for residue type, and do not point to a clear shift in population between different regions of the Ramachandran map. However, a nearly universal decrease in (3) JHN-Hα by 0.22 ± 0.05 Hz suggests a slight increase in population of the polyproline II region at 2500 bar. The first six residues of N-terminally acetylated synuclein show a transient of approximately 15% population of α-helix, which slightly diminishes at 2500 bar. The backbone dynamics of the protein is not visibly affected beyond the effect of slight increase in water viscosity at 2500 bar. ";polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function

Carotid stenting is being evaluated as an alternative to endarterectomy.

3159;18028945;Investigating the mechanism of the nucleocapsid protein chaperoning of the second strand transfer during HIV-1 DNA synthesis.;Conversion of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genomic RNA into the proviral DNA by reverse transcriptase involves two obligatory strand transfers that are chaperoned by the nucleocapsid protein (NC). The second strand transfer relies on the annealing of the (-) and (+) copies of the primer binding site, (-)PBS and (+) PBS, which fold into complementary stem-loops (SLs) with terminal single-stranded overhangs. To understand how NC chaperones their hybridization, we investigated the annealing kinetics of fluorescently labelled (+)PBS with various (-)PBS derivatives. In the absence of NC, the (+)/(-)PBS annealing was governed by a second-order pathway nucleated mainly by the single-stranded overhangs of the two PBS SLs. The annealing reaction appeared to be rate-limited by the melting of the stable G.C-rich stem subsequent to the formation of the partially annealed intermediate. A second pathway nucleated through the loops could be detected, but was very minor. NC(11-55), which consists primarily of the zinc finger domain, increased the (-)/(+) PBS annealing kinetics by about sixfold, by strongly activating the interaction between the PBS loops. NC(11-55) also activated (-)/(+) PBS annealing through the single-strand overhangs, but by a factor of only 2. Full-length NC(1-55) further increased the (-)/(+)PBS annealing kinetics by tenfold. The NC-promoted (-)/(+)PBS mechanism proved to be similar with extended (-)DNA molecules, suggesting that it is relevant in the context of proviral DNA synthesis. These findings favour the notion that the ubiquitous role of NC in the viral life-cycle probably relies on the ability of NC to chaperone nucleic acid hybridization via different mechanisms. ;polycysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function

The sequence presenting anti-platelet activity is mainly present within the Lebetin 1 sequence [Barbouche, R. Marrakchi, N., Mansuelle, P., Krifi, M., Fenouillet, E., Rochat, H. and El Ayeb, M. (1996) Novel anti-platelet aggregation polypeptides from Vipera lebetina venom: isolation and characterization. FEBS Lett. 392, 6-10]. Here, the peptides that compose the Lebetin 1 family were synthesized. Their respective activity was determined. Synthetic L1alpha and L1beta inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation in the nanomolar range. A peptide corresponding to L1beta deleted by D at its N terminus (L1gamma) also inhibited platelet aggregation potently; further truncation of L1gamma impaired its activity. Because L1 peptides efficiently inhibited fibrinogen-induced alpha-chymotrypsin treated-platelet aggregation, we tested whether they act mainly through the inhibition of platelet binding to fibrinogen and showed that they failed to inhibit platelet binding to fibrinogen-coated wells. The activity of L1 peptides was also tested in vivo: their intravenous administration strongly inhibited collagen-induced thrombocytopenia in rats.";-;-;-;hard_0
3167;6641093;Mexiletine in refractory ventricular arrhythmias.;"The antiarrhythmic efficacy of mexiletine was evaluated in 28 subjects with recurrent ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (22 subjects) or with symptomatic complex ventricular ectopy (six subjects). In all, either the arrhythmia was refractory to other drugs, or such therapy was not tolerated. Response to mexiletine was assessed by continuous ECGs, and in five cases by programmed electrical stimulation. Mexiletine abolished the arrhythmia in 12 cases, but was not tolerated long-term in four. Mexiletine was ineffective in 10 subjects. Seven subjects had significant adverse reactions during short-term dosing; in six, mexiletine was discontinued because of adverse effects after the first few doses so efficacy was not evaluated. The most common adverse effects were nausea, tremor, and generalized malaise. We conclude that mexiletine is an effective antiarrhythmic in some patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias refractory to conventional drugs. Adverse effects significantly limit its use.";-;-;-;hard_0
3169;9590540;Molecular cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of cDNA encoding bonnet monkey (Macaca radiata) zona pellucida glycoprotein-ZP2.;"Zona pellucida (ZP) glycoproteins have been proposed as candidate antigens for an immunocontraceptive vaccine. The efficacy of such a vaccine has to be evaluated in nonhuman primates, thus necessitating the characterization of their ZP glycoproteins. A bonnet monkey (Macaca radiata) ovarian cDNA lambda gt11 library was screened for ZP2 (bZP2) using full-length human ZP2 cDNA as a probe. Two identical full-length clones with an open reading frame of 2235 nt encoding a polypeptide of 745 aa residues were isolated. The deduced aa sequence of bZP2 revealed high sequence identity (94.2%) with human ZP2. The bZP2 cDNA (115-1914 nt, 1.8 kb), excluding sequences coding for N-terminal signal sequence and C-terminal transmembranelike domain, was PCR amplified and Sac1-Sal1 restricted fragment cloned in frame downstream of the T5 promoter under the lac operator control in a pQE-30 vector. Recombinant bZP2 (r-bZP2) was expressed as a polyhistidine fusion protein in Escherichia coli strain M15 [pREP4]. Immunoblot with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against bZP2 synthetic peptide (corresponding to aa residues 429-444; K434 replaced by R and 1436 by V) revealed a major band of 68 kDa. Immunization of male rabbits with the r-bZP2 protein purified on Ni-NTA resin under denaturing conditions generated antibodies reactive with r-bZP2 in ELISA as well as with native protein as revealed by positive fluorescence of ZP of bonnet monkey ovary. The availability of r-bZP2 and its aa sequence will help in the development and evaluation of a contraceptive vaccine based on ZP2.";polyhistidine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
3171;8275530;The relative contributions of different intracellular and sarcolemmal systems to relaxation in rat ventricular myocytes.;"OBJECTIVE
The aim was to estimate the relative contributions of the various intracellular and sarcolemmal systems to the relaxation of the systolic calcium transient.


METHODS
The experiments were performed on isolated rat ventricular myocytes. The cells were loaded with the fluorescent indicator indo-1 in order to measure [Ca2+]i.


RESULTS
The application of caffeine to release calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum produced a rise of [Ca2+]i which decayed about 7-8 times more slowly than the electrically stimulated calcium transient. This suggests that the sarcoplasmic reticulum accounts for about 87% of the calcium removal. The rate of decay of the caffeine response was decreased to about 33% of the control by inhibiting the Na-Ca exchange with Ni2+. In the presence of Ni2+ the rate could be inhibited further by inhibiting either the sarcolemmal Ca-ATPase (by increasing extracellular calcium concentration, [Ca2+]o) or the mitochondria (with FCCP and oligomycin). The relative contributions of the various processes were estimated to be: sarcoplasmic reticulum 87%, mitochondria 1.7%, Na-Ca 8.7%, sarcolemmal Ca-ATPase 2.6%.


CONCLUSIONS
These experiments show that the Na-Ca exchange accounts for 67% of the calcium removal not mediated by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This is a smaller fraction than in rabbit cardiac cells and highlights the importance of the Ca-ATPase in the rat heart.";-;-;-;hard_0
3174;8251951;ATP-stimulated translocation promoter that enhances the nuclear binding of activated glucocorticoid receptor complex. Biochemical properties and its function (mini-review).;"Association of nonhormone binding proteins with steroid receptor protein as well as modifications of the receptor by ATP, PPi, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, molybdate, and the large number of less-well-characterized factors are important for the modulation and control of signal transduction in the steroid-receptor systems. Each of the steps in the steroid-receptor system, that is, the steroid binding, nuclear binding, DNA binding, and transcriptional regulations of specific genes (glucocorticoid response elements; GREs), may be controlled by the receptor interactions with other proteins and modulators. During the study on the regulatory mechanism of glucocorticoid-receptor system, we found a new endogenous factor in rat liver cytosol that increases the binding of activated glucocorticoid-receptor complex (GRC) to nuclei in the presence of ATP, and we named this factor ATP-stimulated translocation promoter (ASTP). Recently, we have purified ASTP protein to homogeneity and characterized it. ASTP has an M(r) of 93,000, and is composed of two apparently identical subunits with M(r) of 48,000. The sedimentation coefficient of ASTP is 6.5S, and its isoelectric point is 4.5. ASTP increases the binding of activated GRC to nuclei and chromatin, but not to DNA. ASTP activity is dependent on the physiological concentration of ATP, although ASTP does not bind to ATP-agarose. Interestingly, ASTP can bind to the arginine-rich histones H3 and H4, to which activated GRC also binds. In this article, we will summarize the biochemical properties of this interesting protein (ASTP) and will discuss our thinking about the mode of action.";polyarginine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

3181;1309908;Interaction of Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 with the viral latent origin of replication.;The Epstein-Barr virus latent origin of replication (oriP) requires only one viral protein, the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1), for activity. oriP consists of two spatially separated, essential sequence elements, regions I and II, both of which contain multiple EBNA-1-binding sites. Region II contains, or is close to, the site at which DNA synthesis initiates. The role of region I, a transcriptional enhancer in cells that express EBNA-1, in replication is not understood. To determine how the binding of EBNA-1 to sites in region II leads to the initiation of DNA synthesis and to investigate the role of region I, EBNA-1 has been overproduced in insect cells by using a baculovirus vector and purified to homogeneity, and the interaction of EBNA-1 with oriP has been examined. Footprinting experiments demonstrated that EBNA-1 binds to oriP in a sequence-specific manner and bends or untwists the DNA at two symmetry-related sites in region II. Distortion of region I by EBNA-1 was not detected, suggesting that differences in the spacing of binding sites in regions I and II and resulting protein-protein interactions underlie differences in their biological properties. KMnO4 footprinting experiments did not reveal significant single-stranded structures in region II, suggesting that cellular proteins may recognize the EBNA--region II complex and unwind the DNA duplex. Region I did not quantitatively or qualitatively alter the interaction of EBNA-1 with region II. The contribution of an A + T-rich sequence in region II to replication was investigated by a mutational analysis. The results indicated that the overall A + T-rich nature of this sequence is not essential for replication of oriP-bearing plasmids. Nuclease protection experiments performed with these mutagenized plasmids provided additional evidence for protein-protein interactions in region II. ;polythreonine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
3183;15333588;A molecular pathogenesis for transcription factor associated poly-alanine tract expansions.;Poly-alanine (Ala) tract expansions in transcription factors have been shown to be associated with human birth defects such as malformations of the brain, the digits, and other structures. Expansions of a poly-Ala tract from 15 to 22 (+7)-29 (+14) Ala in Hoxd13, for example, result in the limb malformation synpolydactyly in humans and in mice [synpolydactyly homolog (spdh)]. Here, we show that an increase of the Ala repeat above a certain length (22 Ala) is associated with a shift in the localization of Hoxd13 from nuclear to cytoplasmic, where it forms large amorphous aggregates. We observed similar aggregates for expansion mutations in SOX3, RUNX2 and HOXA13, pointing to a common mechanism. Cytoplasmic aggregation of mutant Hoxd13 protein is influenced by the length of the repeat, the level of expression and the efficacy of degradation by the proteasome. Heat shock proteins Hsp70 and Hsp40 co-localize with the aggregates and activation of the chaperone system by geldanamycin leads to a reduction of aggregate formation. Furthermore, recombinant mutant Hoxd13 protein forms aggregates in vitro demonstrating spontaneous misfolding of the protein. We analyzed the mouse mutant spdh, which harbors a +7 Ala expansion in Hoxd13 similar to the human synpolydactyly mutations, as an in vivo model and were able to show a reduction of mutant Hoxd13 and, in contrast to wt Hoxd13, a primarily cytoplasmic localization of the protein. Our results provide evidence that poly-Ala repeat expansions in transcription factors result in misfolding, degradation and cytoplasmic aggregation of the mutant proteins. ;polyalanine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
3186;31630257;Codon harmonization reduces amino acid misincorporation in bacterially expressed P. falciparum proteins and improves their immunogenicity.;"Codon usage frequency influences protein structure and function. The frequency with which codons are used potentially impacts primary, secondary and tertiary protein structure. Poor expression, loss of function, insolubility, or truncation can result from species-specific differences in codon usage. ""Codon harmonization"" more closely aligns native codon usage frequencies with those of the expression host particularly within putative inter-domain segments where slower rates of translation may play a role in protein folding. Heterologous expression of Plasmodium falciparum genes in Escherichia coli has been a challenge due to their AT-rich codon bias and the highly repetitive DNA sequences. Here, codon harmonization was applied to the malarial antigen, CelTOS (Cell-traversal protein for ookinetes and sporozoites). CelTOS is a highly conserved P. falciparum protein involved in cellular traversal through mosquito and vertebrate host cells. It reversibly refolds after thermal denaturation making it a desirable malarial vaccine candidate. Protein expressed in E. coli from a codon harmonized sequence of P. falciparum CelTOS (CH-PfCelTOS) was compared with protein expressed from the native codon sequence (N-PfCelTOS) to assess the impact of codon usage on protein expression levels, solubility, yield, stability, structural integrity, recognition with CelTOS-specific mAbs and immunogenicity in mice. While the translated proteins were expected to be identical, the translated products produced from the codon-harmonized sequence differed in helical content and showed a smaller distribution of polypeptides in mass spectra indicating lower heterogeneity of the codon harmonized version and fewer amino acid misincorporations. Substitutions of hydrophobic-to-hydrophobic amino acid were observed more commonly than any other. CH-PfCelTOS induced significantly higher antibody levels compared with N-PfCelTOS; however, no significant differences in either IFN-γ or IL-4 cellular responses were detected between the two antigens.

No difference in extracellular fluid volume was noted as estimated by inulin space; old 18.8 +/- 0.6% and young 18.2 +/- 0.7% of body weight.

Similar measurements were made during the infusion of whole blood equal to 2.3% BW. Again the old rats excreted a significantly lower fraction of the infused Na, 55 +/- 10 vs. young 112 +/- 12%. These differences do not appear to be explained by changes in glomerular filtration rate, blood pressure, hematocrit or serum protein concentration.

3190;10355629;The WW domain of dystrophin requires EF-hands region to interact with beta-dystroglycan.;Skeletal muscle dystrophin is a 427 kDa protein thought to act as a link between the actin cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. Perturbations of the dystrophin-associated complex, for example, between dystrophin and the transmembrane glycoprotein beta-dystroglycan, may lead to muscular dystrophy. Previously, the cysteine-rich region and first half of the carboxy-terminal domain of dystrophin were shown to interact with beta-dystroglycan through a stretch of fifteen amino acids at the carboxy-terminus of beta-dystroglycan. This region of dystrophin implicated in binding beta-dystroglycan contains four modular protein domains: a WW domain, two putative Ca2+-binding EF-hand motifs, and a putative zinc finger ZZ domain. The WW domain is a globular domain of 38-40 amino acids with two highly conserved tryptophan residues spaced 20-22 amino acids apart. A subset of WW domains was shown to bind ligands that contain a Pro-Pro-x-Tyr core motif (where x is any amino acid). Here we elucidate the role of the WW domain of dystrophin and surrounding sequence in binding beta-dystroglycan. We show that the WW domain of dystrophin along with the EF-hand motifs binds to the carboxy-terminus of beta-dystroglycan. Through site-specific mutagenesis and in vitro binding assays, we demonstrate that binding of dystrophin to the carboxy-terminus of beta-dystroglycan occurs via a beta-dystroglycan Pro-Pro-x-Tyr core motif. Targeted mutagenesis of conserved WW domain residues reveals that the dystrophin/beta-dystroglycan interaction occurs primarily through the WW domain of dystrophin. Precise mapping of this interaction could aid in therapeutic design. ;polycysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
3194;2062928;Full amino acid sequence of centrally administered NPY required for maximal food intake response.;Central administration of NPY (1-36) potently increases food intake and it has been hypothesized that biological activities of NPY are related to its ability to form an alpha-helix, represented by the fragment NPY (14-31). In this experiment the necessity of N-terminal fragments for increasing food intake was evaluated. Two-h fasted male rats were administered 0, 0.2, 1.0 or 5.0 nmol NPY (1-36) or NPY fragments in 5 microliters saline ICV and intake of lab chow pellets was measured for 22 h. Fragments containing all or part of the polyproline-like helix [NPY (1-8)] antiparallel to the alpha-helix dose-relatedly increased food intake for 4 hours after injection. Five nmol NPY (1-36) and NPY (2-36) increased 4-hour food intake 486 and 219%, respectively (p less than 0.05). Fragments excluding the first 8 amino acids but including all of the alpha-helix also increased food intake, but the response was much reduced. Five nmol NPY (9-36) and NPY (14-36) increased 4-hour food intake 128% (p = 0.02) and 62% (NS), respectively. When all or part of the alpha-helix was excluded, no activity was detected, i.e., NPY (21-36) and NPY (32-36). Substitution of dPro for lPro in position 2 increased potency but not efficacy of NPY since food intake was increased at the 0.2 and 1.0 but not 5.0 nmol doses and the percent increase was not more than to 5 nmol NPY (1-36). Thus the maximum food intake response to NPY requires both C-terminal and N-terminal fragments as well as the alpha-helix.;polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function

3201;9680120;Distinct domains in herpes simplex virus type 1 US11 protein mediate post-transcriptional transactivation of human T-lymphotropic virus type I envelope glycoprotein gene expression and specific binding to the Rex responsive element.;Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) US11 protein is an RNA-binding protein which is able to mediate post-transcriptional transactivation of human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) envelope glycoprotein gene expression by interacting with the Rex responsive element (XRE) located at the 3' end of the env mRNA. In view of this functional activity, and because US11 protein is capable of substituting for HTLV-I Rex protein, it was hypothesized that US11 protein should exhibit at least two functional domains, an RNA-binding domain for specific interaction with the target RNA, and an effector domain involved in transport and translation of this mRNA. Recombinant US11 wild-type and deleted proteins were tested for their ability (i) to bind to the XRE and to HSV-1 UL34 RNA, the natural target of US11 protein, and (ii) to transactivate HTLV-I env gene expression. The C-terminal half of US11 protein, consisting of 20-24 XPR repeats, was necessary and sufficient to mediate RNA-binding with a high affinity and specificity. Structure prediction analyses showed the likely conformation of this domain to be that of a polyproline type II helix. Localized within the first 40 amino acids of the N-terminal region of US11 protein was the effector domain, deletion of which created US11(delta1-40), a trans-dominant negative mutant. These results demonstrate structural differences between US11 protein and proteins like Rex and Rev, despite their functional similarities.;polyproline;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
3202;7904558;Delta-crystallin enhancer binding protein delta EF1 is a zinc finger-homeodomain protein implicated in postgastrulation embryogenesis.;"We investigated nuclear factors that bind to delta 1-crystallin enhancer core and regulate lens-specific transcription. A nuclear factor delta EF1, which binds to the essential element of the delta 1-crystallin enhancer core, was molecularly cloned from the chicken by a southwestern method. The protein organization of delta EF1 deduced from the cDNA sequence indicated that it has heterogeneous domains for DNA-binding, two widely separated zinc fingers and a homeodomain, analogous to Drosophila ZFH-1 protein. The C-terminal zinc fingers were found to be responsible for binding to the delta 1-crystallin enhancer core sequence. delta EF1 had proline-rich and acidic domains common to various transcriptional activators. During embryogenesis, delta EF1 expression was observed in the postgastrulation period in mesodermal tissues; initially, in the notochord, followed by somites, nephrotomes and other components. The expression level changed dynamically in a tissue, possibly reflecting the differentiation states of the constituent cells. Besides mesoderm, delta EF1 was expressed in the nervous system and the lens, but other ectodermal tissues and endoderm remained very low in delta EF1 expression. Cotransfection experiments indicated that this factor acts as a repressor of delta 1-crystallin enhancer. Possession of heterogeneous DNA-binding domains and its dynamic change of expression in embryogenesis strongly suggest that delta EF1 acts in multiple ways depending on the cell type and the gene under its regulation.

3204;1333396;Molecular extinction coefficients of lead sulfide and polymerized diaminobenzidine as final reaction products of histochemical phosphatase reactions.;Molar extinction coefficients of precipitated lead sulfide (PbS) and polymerized diaminobenzidine (polyDAB) have been determined at wavelengths of 450 nm and 480 nm, respectively, for quantitative histochemical analysis of phosphatase reactions. These values are essential for the conversion of cytophotometric (mean integrated) absorbance values to absolute units of substrate converted per unit time and volume of tissue. This conversion allows direct comparison of histochemical and biochemical data. The molar extinction coefficient of PbS at 450 nm was found to be 3,800 and therefore, per mole phosphate liberated, the molar extinction coefficient is 5,700 because 3 moles phosphate are captured by 2 moles lead at neutral or alkaline pH. Parallel experiments with the cerium-DAB method revealed that the molar extinction coefficient of polyDAB at 480 nm is 5,500 with respect to liberated phosphate. The molar extinction coefficients were applied for comparison of data from biochemical and histochemical assays of glucose-6-phosphatase activity in rat livers.

3210;25118863;Fairness norms and theory of mind in an ultimatum game: judgments, offers, and decisions in school-aged children.;The sensitivity to fairness undergoes relevant changes across development. Whether such changes depend on primary inequity aversion or on sensitivity to a social norm of fairness is still debated. Using a modified version of the Ultimatum Game that creates informational asymmetries between Proposer and Responder, a previous study showed that both perceptions of fairness and fair behavior depend upon normative expectations, i.e., beliefs about what others expect one should do in a specific situation. Individuals tend to comply with the norm when risking sanctions, but disregard the norm when violations are undetectable. Using the same methodology with children aged 8-10 years, the present study shows that children's beliefs and behaviors differ from what is observed in adults. Playing as Proposers, children show a self-serving bias only when there is a clear informational asymmetry. Playing as Responders, they show a remarkable discrepancy between their normative judgment about fair procedures (a coin toss to determine the offer) and their behavior (rejection of an unfair offer derived from the coin toss), supporting the existence of an outcome bias effect. Finally, our results reveal no influence of theory of mind on children's decision-making behavior.;-;-;-;hard_0
3211;35562771;The role of endothelin and RAS/ERK signaling in immunopathogenesis-related fibrosis in patients with systemic sclerosis: an updated review with therapeutic implications.;Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a disease of connective tissue with high rate of morbidity and mortality highlighted by extreme fibrosis affecting various organs such as the dermis, lungs, and heart. Until now, there is no specific cure for the fibrosis occurred in SSc disease. The SSc pathogenesis is yet unknown, but transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), endothelin-1 (ET-1), and Ras-ERK1/2 cascade are the main factors contributing to the tissue fibrosis through extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation. Several studies have hallmarked the association of ET-1 with or without TGF-β and Ras-ERK1/2 signaling in the development of SSc disease, vasculopathy, and fibrosis of the dermis, lungs, and several organs. Accordingly, different clinical and experimental studies have indicated the potential therapeutic role of ET-1 and Ras antagonists in these situations in SSc. In addition, ET-1 and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) as a cofactor of the TGF-β cascade play a substantial initiative role in inducing fibrosis. Once initiated, TGF-β alone or in combination with ET-1 and CTGF can activate several kinase proteins such as the Ras-ERK1/2 pathway that serve as the fundamental factor for developing fibrosis. Furthermore, Salirasib is a synthetic small molecule that is able to inhibit all Ras forms. Therefore, it can be used as a potent therapeutic factor for fibrotic disorders. So, this review discusses the role of TGF-β/ET-1/Ras signaling and their involvement in SSc pathogenesis, particularly in its fibrotic situation.;-;-;-;hard_0
3213;30019690;Strategies to optimise occupational radiation protection in interventional cardiology using simultaneous registration of patient and staff doses.;The International Commission on Radiological Protection recommends that occupational protection and patient protection be managed in an integrated approach. This paper describes the experience and the initial results of a system able to register and to process simultaneously staff and patient doses in interventional cardiology and the practical use of this system in the optimisation of occupational exposure. The system used simultaneously collects and manages patient and staff doses for all radiation events. The personal electronic dosimeters worn over the protective apron of health professionals working inside catheterisation laboratories can send (wireless) doses and dose rate values to an X-hub and provide the operators inside the catheterisation rooms with real-time information. Individual and global reports for all the health professionals may be periodically obtained from the system to help with the optimisation. The results for eight cardiologists, one fellow and four nurses for a total of 2468 interventional cardiology procedures and 3207 occupational dose values collected over one year are presented here. Annual doses Hp(10) measured over the apron for cardiologists ranged from 0.3 to 6.3 mSv. For the cardiologist, the ratio between occupational doses (over the apron) and patient doses ranged from 0.05 to 0.23 μSv Gy-1 cm-2, with a mean value of 0.12 μSv Gy-1 cm-2. The system allows defining optimisation strategies by comparing the results between the different operators while considering the workload and complexity of the procedures (based on the total Kerma Area Product managed by the different operators). The registration of the date and time of the occupational radiation doses allows auditing the use of the personal dosimeters worn by the various operators.;-;-;-;hard_0

Sera from sixty patients with case histories of penicillin allergy and with positive or negative skin tests to different penicillin determinants and from seventeen subjects with atopic diseases caused by allergens other than penicillin were tested. The penicilloyl-('major' determinant) specific RAST (Phadebas RAST Penicilloyl G and V) was positive in twenty out of twenty-four patients with positive skin tests to penicilloyl-polylysine, in eight out of twelve patients with sole skin reactivity to 'minor' determinants, and in five out of twenty-four patients with negative skin tests to all antigens used. The penicillamine-specific RAST was the only positive in vitro test in four patients with negative skin tests (two) or sole positive skin reactivity to 'minor' determinants (two), whereas benzylpenicillanyl and ampicillin-polymer discs added no more information than the penicilloyl structures in all patients tested. Antibodies specific to 'minor' determinants apparently show strong in vitro cross-reactivity with the penicilloyl determinant.

This preliminary investigation aimed at assessing the levels of As, Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb, Se, and Zn in natural waters as well as in adults and cysts of fairy shrimps sampled from five different sites in central Italy. Trace elements were determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP)-based spectrometry. In particular, ICP-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was resorted to in most cases due to its high detection power. Pretreatment of samples (adults and cysts) consisted basically in the HNO3-assisted microwave digestion of the material. The highest levels of trace elements were found in the anostracan cysts, with concentration ranges (μg/g) of 0.464-3.11 for As, up to 0.820 for Cd, 2.62-13.0 for Cu, 0.011-0.213 for Hg, 0.966-8.46 for Pb, 0.295-2.45 for Se, and 16.4-50.4 for Zn. On the other hand, the lowest concentrations were found in natural waters, with values close to the ICP-MS detection power for some elements.

3220;6447202;Use of impromidine to define specific histamine H-2 effects on gastric secretion, heart rate and blood pressure in conscious dogs.;"Histamine H-2 receptor-mediated effects of the very selective H-2 agonist (H-1:H-2 < 1:1000) impromidine on gastric acid, chloride and pepsin secretion and on heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure were compared to those of histamine in five conscious gastric fistula dogs. In each dog, impromidine in a step-dose response (0.46 to 46 nmol/kg.hr) in 45-min steps was given without and with a background infusion of cimetidine (2 mumol/kg.hr). Histamine acid phosphate was given in a seven step-dose response (18 to 1350 nmol/kg. hr). Impromidine produced the same maximum stimulation of gastric HCI output, increase of HR and fall in systolic blood pressure as histamine. Impromidine was some 38 times more potent than histamine in stimulation of acid (ED50 3.8 vs. 145 nmol/kg.hr) and 30 times more potent in raising HR (ED50 5.6 vs. 172 nmol/kg.hr). Cimetidine competitively inhibited the effects of impromidine with similar pA2 values for each effect (acid, 5.99; chloride, 6.03; change in HR, 6.03; and change in systolic blood pressure, 6.32). The effects of impromidine on pepsin secretion were qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those of histamine and other H-2 agonists with weak stimulation at low doses and progressive inhibition with increasing doses of impromidine. Coupling the results with the known high specificity of impromidine, gastric acid secretion, chronotropism and hypotension all seem to be purely H-2-mediated effects of histamine in the intact conscious dog.";-;-;-;hard_0
3224;2430799;Sulphate groups are involved in the antigenicity of keratan sulphate and mask i antigen expression on their poly-N-acetyllactosamine backbones. An immunochemical and chromatographic study of keratan sulphate oligosaccharides after desulphation or nitrosation.;Conditions were established for desulphation of hexa-, octa-, deca- and larger oligosaccharides derived from corneal keratan sulphate after treatment with endo-beta-galactosidase. The antigenicities of the desulphated oligosaccharides were compared with those of the native oligosaccharides in chromatogram binding, plastic-plate binding or inhibition of binding assays using a novel microimmunochemical approach with oligosaccharide-lipid conjugates (neoglycolipids). The results clearly show that sulphate residues are essential components of the antigenic determinant(s) recognised by three monoclonal antibodies to keratan sulphate, 5-D-4, 1-B-4 and MZ15, but they mask the i antigen activity of the linear poly-(N-acetyllactosamine) backbones of this glycosaminoglycan. Immunochemical assays, before and after beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase treatment of desulphated linear hexa-, octa- and decasaccharides derived from keratan sulphate, indicate that for reaction with one anti-i antibody, Den, there is an absolute requirement for the non-reducing beta-galactosyl residue of the i antigen structure to be in the terminal position, but with a second anti-i antibody, Tho, there is in addition some reactivity with the i antigen structure having an N-acetylglucosamine residue at the non-reducing end. The chromatographic properties after desulphation or nitrosation of a minor keratan sulphate oligosaccharide (a dodecasaccharide), which reacts especially well with antibody 5-D-4, have provided the first evidence for the presence of glucosamine residues that may be N-sulphated in corneal keratan sulphate.;polyasparagine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
3226;8101776;Hypergravity, aging and longevity in Drosophila melanogaster.;1. Drosophila melanogaster flies have been used in studies of the effect of hypergravity (HG) on aging and longevity. 2. There is no clear longevity decrease with the gravity level up to 4 g and, even at 7 g, flies still live for roughly 40 days. 3. The HG-related changes in fecundity suggest that flies counteract an increased metabolic demand. 4. Viability is barely affected in HG. 5. These results show that flies remain able to lay viable eggs and to live for a fairly long life, even at high HG levels. 6. The study of three behavioral traits affected by aging (climbing activity, pattern of movement, spontaneous locomotor activity) suggests that flies age faster in HG, while no HG effect is clearly detected at young age. 7. These results are observed at HG levels where longevity is not yet affected. 8. Results are discussed in relation with Pearl's rate of living theory (1928).;-;-;-;hard_0
3227;8862424;HIV-1 Nef association with cellular serine kinase correlates with enhanced virion infectivity and efficient proviral DNA synthesis.;We previously reported on the association of Nef with a cellular serine kinase (E.T. Sawal et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91, 1539-1543, 1994). In the present study, we further define the Nef sequence requirements for this kinase association and investigate the effect of this kinase association on functions of HIV-1 Nef. We observe that, in addition to the membrane targeting signal and the conserved arg-arg residues within the core region, mutations in the proline-rich domain of Nef also affect its ability to associate with the serine kinase activity. The region encompassing the arg-arg residues of Nef is shown to be important for Nef-mediated cell-surface CD4 down-modulation as well as enhancement of viral growth properties. This is similar to what has previously been observed for the membrane targeting site at the N-terminus of Nef. In contrast, the proline-rich region of Nef is found to be involved in mediating efficient proviral DNA synthesis and the enhanced virion-infectivity function, but is not necessary for CD4 down-modulation by Nef. Thus, it appears that serine kinase association of Nef is necessary for efficient proviral DNA synthesis and for promotion of virion infectivity of Nef viruses, but is dispensable for down-regulation of the CD4 receptor by Nef. These findings define three functional domains of Nef that are required for its interaction with the serine kinase activity and suggest that the cellular interaction events via the myristoylation and arg-arg regions of Nef lie upstream of the interaction event via the proline-rich domain.;polyproline;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function

All patients (N = 304) were initially classified as having single-species P. falciparum (n = 148 samples) or P. vivax infections (n = 156). Dried blood spots were tested for Plasmodium antigens by bead-based multiplex assay for pan-Plasmodium aldolase, pan-Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase, P. vivax lactate dehydrogenase, and histidine-rich protein 2. Of 304 blood samples, 13 (4.3%) contained both P. falciparum and P. vivax antigens and were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction for species-specific DNA. Of these 13 samples, five were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction for P. falciparum/P. vivax co-infection. One sample, initially classified as P. vivax by microscopy, was found to only have Plasmodium ovale DNA.

3235;30619302;Metformin Promotes the Protection of Mice Infected With Plasmodium yoelii Independently of γδ T Cell Expansion.;Adaptive immune responses are critical for protection against infection with Plasmodium parasites. The metabolic state dramatically changes in T cells during activation and the memory phase. Recent findings suggest that metformin, a medication for treating type-II diabetes, enhances T-cell immune responses by modulating lymphocyte metabolism. In this study, we investigated whether metformin could enhance anti-malaria immunity. Mice were infected with Plasmodium yoelii and administered metformin. Levels of parasitemia were reduced in treated mice compared with those in untreated mice, starting at ~2 weeks post-infection. The number of γδ T cells dramatically increased in the spleens of treated mice compared with that in untreated mice during the later phase of infection, while that of αβ T cells did not. The proportions of Vγ1+ and Vγ2+ γδ T cells increased, suggesting that activated cells were selectively expanded. However, these γδ T cells expressed inhibitory receptors and had severe defects in cytokine production, suggesting that they were in a state of exhaustion. Metformin was unable to rescue the cells from exhaustion at this stage. Depletion of γδ T cells with antibody treatment did not affect the reduction of parasitemia in metformin-treated mice, suggesting that the effect of metformin on the reduction of parasitemia was independent of γδ T cells.;-;-;-;hard_0
3240;9692659;Pharmacokinetic profile and variability of cyclosporine versus neoral in patients with cystic fibrosis after lung transplantation.;Various factors may influence bioavailability and blood concentrations of cyclosporine, a problem that may be compounded by diseases such as cystic fibrosis in which impaired absorption through the gastrointestinal tract is common. Neoral, a microemulsion formulation of cyclosporine, has improved bioavailability and more stable blood concentrations than earlier formulations. We conducted a prospective, open, crossover study to examine whether these findings held true in 12 clinically stable patients with cystic fibrosis who had undergone lung transplantation at least 6 months earlier. In the first arm, patients continued their usual dosage of cyclosporine twice/day. In the second arm they received Neoral for at least 1 week before having blood studies. For each arm whole blood trough concentrations were drawn for 7-10 successive days, together with a pharmacokinetic study with concentrations drawn at times zero, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours. Variance was assessed from morning concentrations. Area under the curve from zero to 12 hours (AUC12), maximum concentration (Cmax), and time to Cmax (Tmax) were calculated for each arm. Eleven subjects completed the protocol. The daily variance for Neoral was significantly less than for cyclosporine (p=0.04). The AUC12 for Neoral and cyclosporine were 4164+/-1467 and 5318+/-1670 microg x L/hour (p=0.09), respectively. Respective Cmax were 613+/-242 and 931 +/-458 microg/L (p=0.08) and relative Cmax and AUC12 were 1.91 and 1.47 (p<0.05).

3246;10088022;Video-endoscope versus endoscope for paranasal sinus surgery: influence on visual acuity and color discrimination.;Endoscopic and video-endoscopic visual acuity and color discrimination were investigated using a standard disk for testing visual acuity and a color discrimination test. A 1-chip-CCD-Camera (CCC) or 3-chip-CCD-Camera plus digital image processing (digivideo) on the endoscope and a 15 inch high resolution video monitor were used. Color discrimination was investigated by comparing the ability to sort colored disks of low chromatic saturation (desaturated Panel D-15 Test), ranging from yellow to red, under direct vision or via monitor using the same 1-CCC- and 3-CCC-system. Visual acuity deteriorated by 1.58 +/- 0.16 steps (+/- SEM) for the 1-CCC and 1.21 +/- 0.16 steps for the 3-CCC plus digivideo compared to vision through the endoscope (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001). Visual acuity was significantly better for the 3-CCC-video-endoscope compared to the 1-CCC-video-endoscope (p = 0.0045). The difference in color discrimination between the naked eye and the 1-CCC-monitor system was not significant. More mistakes were made with the 3-CCC-monitor system. The impairment of image quality with the video endoscope, which is experienced by many surgeons, is reflected in a marked loss of visual acuity in our experiments. Sharpness and contrast of the video-image are significantly enhanced by the 3-CCC plus digital image processing, compared to the 1-CCC. Color discrimination, however, was not impaired by the 1-CCC, indicating that color perception with the video-endoscope can be very good and may not contribute significantly to the loss of image quality.;-;-;-;hard_0
3248;2443024;Quinidine-induced inhibition of transient outward current in cardiac muscle.;Quinidine is frequently used as a class I antiarrhythmic agent in the management of cardiac rhythm disturbances. It depresses the rapid initial depolarization of the action potential by blocking the sodium current, INa. In addition, quinidine increases the duration of the action potential and lengthens the refractory period. We have used a whole cell voltage-clamp technique to study the ionic mechanism underlying the lengthening of the action potential in single cells from the atrium and ventricle of the rabbit heart. Our data show that quinidine at therapeutic doses (3-10 microM) is a potent and selective inhibitor of a transient outward current, which controls the early repolarization of the action potential. In contrast, neither the calcium current, ICa, nor the time-independent background K+ current, IK1, is changed significantly by 10 microM quinidine. The reduction in the transient outward current can explain the lengthening of action potential and provides new insight into the mechanism of action of quinidine as an antiarrhythmic agent.;-;-;-;hard_0
3249;24863059;A DEAD-box RNA helicase produces two forms of transcript that differentially respond to cold stress in a cryophyte (Chorispora bungeana).;This work demonstrated that a cold-induced DEAD-box RNA helicase, CbDRH, is also post-transcriptionally regulated upon cold stress, and it interacts with a cold-responsive, glycine-rich, RNA-binding protein, CbGRP. Chorispora bungeana (C. bungeana) is a representative alpine subnival plant species that shows strong tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses, especially cold stress. DEAD-box RNA helicases are implicated in almost all RNA metabolic processes and participate in multiple abiotic stress responses. Here, we characterized a cold-induced DEAD-box RNA helicase gene from C. bungeana. We cloned the full-length cDNA of the gene by RACE and called it C. bungeana DEAD-box RNA Helicase (CbDRH). Structurally, CbDRH possesses all nine conserved motifs characteristic of DEAD-box protein family members in its central region, and the N- and C- terminal extensions both harbor a glycine-rich region containing several RGG-box motifs. The CbDRH gene produces two forms of transcripts, CbDRH.2 and CbDRH.1, by alternative splicing. CbDRH.2 comes from the complete excision of all the nine introns, while CbDRH.1 results from the use of an alternative 5' splice site in the eighth intron, retaining part of the intron (the first 260 bp) with an early stop codon. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that CbDRH.2, but not CbDRH.1, is up-regulated by cold stress. However, the abundance of CbDRH.1 transcript can be elevated by cycloheximide (an inhibitor of nonsense-mediated decay) treatment, indicating that CbDRH.1 is targeted to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). A subcellular localization analysis showed that CbDRH.2 protein is located in the nuclei. Further investigation suggested that CbDRH.2 can interact with a cold-responsive, glycine-rich, RNA-binding protein, CbGRP (Chorispora bungeana glycine-rich, RNA-binding protein). These data suggest that the cold-induced CbDRH is also post-transcriptionally regulated under cold stress and that CbDRH.2 may function together with the glycine-rich, RNA-binding protein, CbGRP, in the cold stress response. ;polyglycine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
3256;3169881;Structure and expression of the Lyt-3a gene of C.AKR mice.;The mouse Lyt-3a gene, which encodes the Lyt-3.1 T-cell surface alloantigen of the C.AKR strain, has been cloned, and the nucleotide sequence of its exons and more than 2 kb of 5' flanking sequence have been determined. The gene extends over approximately 16 kb of DNA and consists of six exons encoding leader, leader plus V-like domain, membrane-proximal, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains. The only difference between the coding region of the Lyt-3a gene and the cDNA sequences reported for Lyt-3b (Nakauchi et al. 1987. Panaccio et al. 1987) is at position 77 of the mature protein where Lyt-3a encodes serine and Lyt-3b encodes arginine. This substitution must therefore be the basis for the serological distinction between the Lyt-3.1 and Lyt-3.2 alloantigens. Potential TATA and CAAT sequences, two Sp1 protein binding sites, two extended repeats of the dinucleotide, CA, a number of short inverted repeats, and an inverted segment of the mouse B1 repetitive sequence are found 5' to the Lyt-3a gene. Two consensus poly-A addition signals and a complete copy of the mouse B1 sequence are found 3' to the gene. Both B1-related regions are flanked by short direct repeats suggesting that they arose by an insertional mechanism.

Psychiatric patients had twice the risk of dying during a heat wave than the general population. The risk for patients was higher in the 1950s, before the introduction of antipsychotic medications, than in the 1980s, but was highest in the 1970s, when higher dosages of antipsychotic medication were commonly used. During 1980 to 1984 the risk was the same for both populations, suggesting that both psychiatric illness and antipsychotic medications increase patients' risk of dying during heat waves but that risk can be eliminated with preventive measures.;-;-;-;hard_0
3264;8423788;A new serum-responsive, cardiac tissue-specific transcription factor that recognizes the MEF-2 site in the myosin light chain-2 promoter.;We have identified a serum-responsive, cardiac tissue-specific transcription factor, BBF-1, that recognizes an AT-rich sequence (element B), identical to the myocyte enhancer factor (MEF-2) target site, in the cardiac myosin light chain-2 (MLC-2) promoter. Deletion of the element B sequence alone from the cardiac MLC-2 promoter causes, as does that of the MEF-2 site from other promoters and the enhancer of skeletal muscle genes, a marked reduction of transcription. BBF-1 is distinguishable from cardiac MEF-2 on the basis of immunoprecipitation with an antibody which recognizes MEF-2 but not BBF-1. Unlike MEF-2, BBF-1 is present exclusively in nuclear extracts from cardiac muscle cells cultured in a medium containing a high concentration of serum. Removal of serum from culture medium abolishes BBF-1 activity selectively with a concomitant loss of the positive regulatory effect of element B on MLC-2 gene transcription, indicating that there is a correlation between the BBF-1 binding activity and the tissue-specific role of the element B (MEF-2 site) sequence. The loss of element B-mediated activation of transcription is reversed following the refeeding of cells with serum-containing medium. These data demonstrate that cardiac muscle cells contain two distinct protein factors, MEF-2 and BBF-1, which bind to the same target site but that, unlike MEF-2, BBF-1 is serum inducible and cardiac tissue specific. BBF-1 thus appears to be a crucial member of the MEF-2 family of proteins which will serve as an important tool in understanding the regulatory mechanism(s) underlying cardiogenic differentiation. ;polythreonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

3270;15448205;PKC412 inhibits the zinc finger 198-fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 fusion tyrosine kinase and is active in treatment of stem cell myeloproliferative disorder.;"Human stem cell leukemia-lymphoma syndrome usually presents itself as a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) that evolves to acute myeloid leukemia and/or lymphoma. The syndrome associated with t(8;13)(p11;q12) results in expression of the ZNF198-fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1 fusion tyrosine kinase. Current empirically derived cytotoxic chemotherapy is inadequate for treatment of this disease. We hypothesized that small-molecule inhibitors of the ZNF198-FGFR1 fusion would have therapeutic efficacy. We characterized the transforming activity of ZNF198-FGFR1 in hematopoietic cells in vitro and in vivo. Expression of ZNF198-FGFR1 in primary murine hematopoietic cells caused a myeloproliferative syndrome in mice that recapitulated the human MPD phenotype. Transformation in these assays, and activation of the downstream effector molecules PLC-gamma, STAT5, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT, required the proline-rich domains, but not the ZNF domains, of ZNF198. A small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PKC412 (N-benzoyl-staurosporine) effectively inhibited ZNF198-FGFR1 tyrosine kinase activity and activation of downstream effector pathways, and inhibited proliferation of ZNF198-FGFR1 transformed Ba/F3 cells. Furthermore, treatment with PKC412 resulted in statistically significant prolongation of survival in the murine model of ZNF198-FGFR1-induced MPD. Based in part on these data, PKC412 was administered to a patient with t(8;13)(p11;q12) and was efficacious in treatment of progressive myeloproliferative disorder with organomegaly. Therefore, PKC412 may be a useful therapy for treatment of human stem cell leukemia-lymphoma syndrome. ";polyproline;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function

Human cytokeratin no. 8 is a typical cytokeratin of the basic (type II) subfamily, which is highly homologous to the corresponding bovine and amphibian (Xenopus laevis) proteins; however, unlike the amphibian protein, it does not contain glycine-rich oligopeptide repeats in its carboxyterminal 'tail' domain. Comparison with the reported amino acid sequences of two fragments of human 'tissue polypeptide antigen' (TPA), a widely used serodiagnostic carcinoma marker, revealed sequence identity, indicating that this serum component is derived from the intracellular cytokeratin no. 8 present in diverse kinds of epithelia and epithelium-derived tumors. Human cytokeratin no. 18 is very similar to the corresponding murine protein but contains two additional blocks of 4 and 5 amino acids in the 'head' portion. These cDNA clones and the RNA probes derived therefrom were used to detect specifically mRNAs by Northern-blot assays of RNAs from various carcinomas and cultured carcinoma cells. Using in situ hybridization on frozen sections of tumor-containing tissues, notably lymph nodes containing metastatic breast carcinoma, we were able to demonstrate the specificity and sensitivity of this procedure.

3275;9241367;Identification of a microsatellite region composed of a long homopurine/homopyrimidine tract surrounded by AT-rich sequences upstream of the rat stress-inducible hsp 70.1 gene.;A DNA region containing several repetitive motifs has been detected about 1.9 kbp upstream of the transcription unit of the rat stress-inducible hsp 70.1 gene. The most interesting element of this area is a microsatellite sequence (GA)6CAG(TC)24 that consists of an inverted repeat partially overlapping with the long homopurine/homopyrimidine tract (Pu/Py).

Of those, the ptr5-1 mutant shows dots- or a ring-like accumulation of poly(A)(+) RNA at the nuclear periphery after shifting to the nonpermissive temperature. We cloned the ptr5(+) gene and found that it encodes a component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), nucleoporin 85 (Nup85). The ptr5-1 mutant shows no defects in protein transport, suggesting the specific involvement of Ptr5p/Nup85p in nuclear mRNA export in S. pombe. We identified Seh1p, a nucleoporin interacting with Nup85p, an mRNA-binding protein Mlo3p, and Sac3p, a component of the TREX-2 complex involved in coupling of nuclear mRNA export with transcription, as multi-copy suppressors for the ptr5-1 mutation. In addition, we found that the ptr5-1 mutation is synthetically lethal with a mutation of the mRNA export factor Rae1p, and that the double mutant exaggerates defective nuclear mRNA export, suggesting that Ptr5p/Nup85p is involved in nuclear mRNA export through Rae1p. Interestingly, the ptr5-1 mutation also showed synthetic effects with several prp pre-mRNA splicing mutations, suggesting a functional linkage between the NPCs and the splicing apparatus in the yeast nucleus. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

All recombinants with both orientations of L present in equal amounts contain TRL and IRL regions derived at least in part from the same parent (HSV-1 or HSV-2) as a result of previously undetected crossovers in these regions. Recombinants with a predominance of one orientation of L have TRL and IRL regions derived from different parents. Homology between a sequences alone at the L terminus and L-S joint is sufficient for normal inversion of L. Analysis of another recombinant, RE4, which fails to invert normally in both L and S, suggests that normal inversion of S is dependent upon the presence of TRS and IRS regions derived at least in part from the same parent. We conclude that segment inversion specifically depends upon the a sequence, that the process of DNA replication and maturation does not necessarily produce molecules with identical a sequences, and that direct ligation of termini may occur during DNA replication.;-;-;-;hard_0
3283;11906820;The novel human HUEL (C4orf1) protein shares homology with the DNA-binding domain of the XPA DNA repair protein and displays nuclear translocation in a cell cycle-dependent manner.;We have previously isolated and characterized a novel human gene HUEL (C4orf1) that is ubiquitously expressed in a wide range of human fetal, adult tissues and cancer cell lines. HUEL maps to region 4p12-p13 within the short arm of chromosome 4 whose deletion is frequently associated with bladder and other carcinomas. Here we present the genomic organization, sizes and boundaries of exons and introns of HUEL. The GC-rich upstream genomic region and 5' untranslated region (UTR) together constitute a CpG island, a hallmark of housekeeping genes. The 3250 bp HUEL cDNA incorporates a 1704 bp ORF that translates into a hydrophilic protein of 568-amino acids (aa), detected as a band of approximately 70 kDa by Western blotting. We have isolated the murine homolog of HUEL which exhibits 89% nucleotide and 94% amino acid identity to its human counterpart. The HUEL protein shares significant homology with the minimal DNA-binding domain (DNA-BD) of the DNA repair protein encoded by the xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XPA) gene. Other notable features within HUEL include the putative nuclear receptor interaction motif, nuclear localization and export signals, zinc finger, leucine zipper and acidic domains. Mimosine-mediated cell cycle synchronization of PLC/PRF/5 liver cancer cells clearly portrayed translocation of HUEL into the nucleus specifically during the S phase of the cell cycle. Yeast two-hybrid experiments revealed interactions of HUEL with two partner proteins (designated HIPC and HIPB) bearing similarity to a mitotically phosphorylated protein and to reverse transcriptase. Co-immunoprecipitation assays validated the interaction between HUEL and HIPC proteins in mammalian cells. HUEL is likely to be an evolutionarily conserved, housekeeping gene that plays a role intimately linked with cellular replication, DNA synthesis and/or transcriptional regulation. ;polycysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
3289;34766032;Biochemical approach for isolation of polyadenylated RNAs with bound proteins from yeast.;In vivo characterization of RNA-protein interactions is the key for understanding RNA regulatory mechanisms. Herein, we describe a protocol for detection of proteins interacting with polyadenylated RNAs in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Proteins are crosslinked to nucleic acids in vivo by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of cells, and poly(A)-containing RNAs with bound proteins are isolated from cell lysates using oligo[dT]25 beads. RBPs can be detected by immunoblot analysis or with mass spectrometry to define the mRNA-binding proteome (mRBPome) and its changes under stress.

3290;1922039;Novel protein-DNA interactions associated with increased immunoglobulin transcription in response to antigen plus interleukin-5.;Although much has been learned about basal levels of immunoglobulin (Ig) transcription, the regulatory effects of cytokines and antigen (Ag) upon Ig expression in lymphocytes have not been fully characterized. We previously reported that Ag plus interleukin-5 (IL-5) caused increased steady-state Ig mRNA levels in Ag-specific cell lines. In this study, we have identified a region between -250 and -125 bp 5' of the Ig transcription start site that is necessary for the induction of increased mu mRNA levels by Ag plus IL-5. Mobility shift and UV cross-linking studies indicated that IL-5 plus Ag induced increased protein binding to this region. Furthermore, this sequence was found to be closely related to another A + T-rich sequence at -525 bp 5' of the transcription start site. Both sequences exhibited similar B-cell-specific and inducible protein binding. Our data suggest that treatment with IL-5 plus Ag induces several DNA-binding proteins, some of which may participate in increasing Ig transcription above basal levels by binding to sequences 5' of the octamer motif. ;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
3291;7963739;Differential T cell responses to mycobacteria-secreted proteins distinguish vaccination with bacille Calmette-Guérin from infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.;The immune responses of healthy recipients of Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, tuberculosis (TB) patients, and contacts of TB patients were examined to three major secretory proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, MPB59, MPB64, and MPB70. MPB59 evoked a T cell response in 78% of BCG vaccines, 62% of TB patients, and 60% of contacts. MPB64 and MPB70 were recognized by < 15% of BCG vaccinees, half of TB patients, and three-quarters of contacts. TB and leprosy patients had antibody responses to MPB59, but few had antibodies to MPB64 or MPB70. Hybridization of mycobacterial DNA with specific gene probes demonstrated the absence of a gene for MBP64 in the vaccine strain of BCG, but the MPB70 gene was found in all virulent and vaccine BCG strains tested. Since MPB64 and MPB70 can induce delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions in infected animals, either of these proteins may have potential as skin test reagents for detecting infection with M. tuberculosis.;-;-;-;hard_0
3292;32750545;Identification of two carcinin isoforms (MnCarc1 and MnCarc2) and their function in the antimicrobial immunity of Macrobrachium nipponense.;Carcinin, a member of the crustin family, plays important roles in crustacean innate immunity. In this study, we identified two carcinin isoforms (MnCarc1 and MnCarc2) produced by alternative splicing from Macrobrachium nipponense. The full length of MnCarc1 and MnCarc2 cDNA are 1554 and 1495 bp with 687 and 609 bp open reading frame-encoding proteins that contain 228 and 202 amino acids, respectively. The genome of carcinin has nine exons and eight introns. MnCarc1 transcript contains all nine exons, whereas MnCarc2 only contains eight exons and lacks exon 4. MnCarc1 and MnCarc2 proteins contain a signal peptide, cysteine-rich regions, and a whey acidic protein domain. The phylogenetic tree shows that MnCarc1 and MnCarc2 are not grouped with other crustins and carcinins. MnCarc1 and MnCarc2 form a subgroup. MnCarc1 and MnCarc2 are widely distributed in various tissues. The expression of MnCarc1 and MnCarc2 were evidently upregulated at multiple time points in hemocytes and the intestine of M. nipponense after white spot syndrome virus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Staphylococcus aureus challenges. Further studies showed that knockdown of MnDorsal or MnStat transcription factor could remarkably inhibit the upregulated expression of MnCarc1 and MnCarc2 caused by viral or bacterial challenges. In addition, recombinant MnCarc1 and MnCarc2 proteins could bind to various bacteria and polysaccharides and inhibit the growth of S. aureus and V. parahaemolyticus in vitro. This study indicated that carcinins from M. nipponense were involved in prawns innate immunity.;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
3293;11090190;Identification of a domain in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 rev that is required for functional activity and modulates association with subnuclear compartments containing splicing factor SC35.;"The activity of human immunodeficiency virus Rev as a regulator of viral mRNA expression is tightly linked to its ability to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm; these properties are conferred by a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) and by an arginine-rich nuclear localization signal/RNA binding domain (NLS/RBD) required for binding to the Rev-responsive element (RRE) located on viral unspliced and singly spliced mRNAs. Structure predictions and biophysical measurements indicate that Rev consists of an unstructured region followed by a helix-loop-helix motif containing the NLS/RBD and sequences directing multimerization and by a carboxy-terminal tail containing the NES. We present evidence that the loop portion of the helix-loop-helix region is an essential functional determinant that is required for binding to the RRE and for correct intracellular routing. Data obtained using a protein kinase CK2 phosphorylation assay indicated that the loop region is essential for juxtaposition of helices 1 and 2 and phosphorylation by protein kinase CK2. Deletion of the loop resulted in partial accumulation of Rev in SC35-positive nuclear bodies that resembled nuclear bodies that form in response to inhibition of transcription. Accumulation of the DeltaLoop mutant in nuclear bodies depended on the presence of an intact NES, suggesting that both the loop and the NES play a role in controlling intranuclear compartmentalization of Rev and its association with splicing factors.

3295;6321668;Intra-axonal virus in demyelinative lesions of experimental herpes simplex type 2 infection.;Three-week-old mice which had been infected intracerebrally with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) were examined electron-microscopically for the presence of intra-axonal virus in or near optic nerve and spinal cord demyelinative lesions. Acute lesions and their margins frequently contained a very small proportion of abnormal axons, and in a few of these mature virus particles, nucleocapsids, or other incomplete forms were found. A similar range of particle morphology was present in the cytoplasm of infected and degenerating glia. Axons containing similar particles were not identified in fibers in normal white matter surrounding demyelinative lesions. It is proposed that neuronal infection and axonal transport of virus may lead to foci of oligodendroglial infection, destruction and central nervous system (CNS) demyelination near to or remote from the cell bodies of infected neurons. In some instances, the topography of lesions could reflect a tract association. Anatomical features of nervous tissue could favor amplification of demyelination from a relatively minimal neuronal infection, with little evidence of tract degeneration. This hypothesis is consistent with the great predominance of demyelination relative to gray matter disease seen experimentally in non-fatal CNS infections with HSV-2. It would also explain the marked tendency for demyelinative lesions in at least certain CNS locations to be greatly elongated in the long axis of fiber tracts. This mechanism could be of importance in other animal models of virus-induced demyelination, and perhaps also in multiple sclerosis.;-;-;-;hard_0
3296;8176643;Self-help groups: a key to HIV risk reduction for high-risk injection drug users?;"While recent studies indicate that injection drug users (IDUs) can change their behavior to reduce injection risk of HIV, it remains unclear which users are most likely to change and which mediating variables are most amenable to intervention. We report a study in which a cohort of high-risk IDUs was followed over time to determine which variables were associated with reduced injection risk of HIV. Of 317 IDUs who at baseline had shared a dirty needle in the previous 30 days, 234 (74%) were followed for 6 months. Of these, 107 (46%) reported reduced or eliminated injection risk between the baseline and follow-up interviews, 82 (35%) by not injecting and 25 (11%) by not sharing syringes. Those who attended self-help meetings between the two interviews were almost twice as likely to report reduced or eliminated risk as those who did not attend (OR = 1.92; p = 0.04). The findings suggest that, at least, IDUs in self-help groups comprise a population amenable to HIV interventions and, at most, that self-help groups may play an important role in reducing the risk of HIV in out-of-treatment populations.";-;-;-;hard_0
3298;6501941;Interferon-mediated protein kinase activity in different fractions of mouse L-929 cells.;The interferon (IFN)-mediated protein kinase activity in extracts from mouse L-929 cells is manifested by the phosphorylation of an endogenous 67 kD molecular weight (mw) protein in the presence of double-stranded (ds) RNA. This protein kinase activity can also be assayed after partial purification on poly(I) X poly(C)-Sepharose under phosphatase-free conditions. By the use of this latter technique, here we investigated the distribution of the protein kinase activity in different cellular compartments. Most of the protein kinase activity is found in the post-ribosomal supernatant (S100) fraction, while a small portion of it is associated with the ribosomal salt wash (RSW: 0.5 M KCl eluate of ribosomal pellet) and nuclear fractions. These results are in contrast to several observations in the literature in which the protein kinase activity is thought to be associated with the ribosomal pellet. This controversy results from the conditions used for assay of the protein kinase activity. In fact, when the kinase is assayed in crude extracts supplemented with dsRNA, very little kinase activity is detectable in the S100 fraction compared to the RSW fraction. The S100 fraction contains a high level of phosphatase(s) activity which interferes with the protein kinase assay and might account for the misinterpretation observed in the literature. Some recent results have implicated a correlation between the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of the 67 kD protein and a polyamine-dependent protein kinase which phosphorylates a similar molecular weight protein, subunit of ornithine decarboxylase (Orn Dcase). Here, we show that Orn Dcase does not bind to poly(I) X poly(C)-Sepharose and polyamines do not substitute the requirement of dsRNA for the phosphorylation of the 67 kD protein. ;polycysteine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function

Here, we examined the acid-base and conformational equilibria of this G-quadruplex-forming region (BCL2G), as well as its interaction with both the porphyrin TMPyP4 and with the complementary C-rich strand. We used molecular absorption and circular dichroism techniques, in tandem with multivariate analysis tools. The results revealed the formation of an interaction complex BCL2G:TMPyP4 with a stoichiometry of 1:2 and an equilibrium constant equal to 5.0 (+/-2.3) x 10(13) M(-2). Addition of the complementary C-rich strand to BCL2G induces the predominant formation of the Watson-Crick double-helix with an equilibrium constant equal to 10(7.7) M(-1) (at pH 7.1).

3300;36394266;Phox2b mutation mediated by Atoh1 expression impaired respiratory rhythm and ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia.;"Mutations in the transcription factor Phox2b cause congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS). The syndrome is characterized by hypoventilation and inability to regulate breathing to maintain adequate O2 and CO2 levels. The mechanism by which CCHS impact respiratory control is incompletely understood, and even less is known about the impact of the non-polyalanine repeat expansion mutations (NPARM) form. Our goal was to investigate the extent by which NPARM Phox2b mutation affect (a) respiratory rhythm; (b) ventilatory responses to hypercapnia (HCVR) and hypoxia (HVR); and (c) number of chemosensitive neurons in mice. We used a transgenic mouse line carrying a conditional Phox2b mutation (same found in humans with NPARM CCHS). We crossed them with Atoh1 mice to introduce mutation in regions involved with respiratory function and central chemoreflex control. Ventilation was measured by plethysmograph during neonatal and adult life. In room air, mutation in neonates and adult did not greatly impact basal ventilation. However, Phox2b, Atoh1 increased breath irregularity in adults. The HVR and HCVR were impaired in neonates. The HVR, but not HCVR, was still partially compromised in adults. The mutation reduced the number of Phox2b+/TH--expressing neurons as well as the number of fos-activated cells within the ventral parafacial region (also named retrotrapezoid nucleus [RTN] region) induced by hypercapnia. Our data indicates that Phox2b mutation in Atoh1-expressing cells impaired RTN neurons, as well as chemoreflex under hypoxia and hypercapnia specially early in life.

3310;20525799;A major grain protein content locus on barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) chromosome 6 influences flowering time and sequential leaf senescence.;"Timing of various developmental stages including anthesis and whole-plant ('monocarpic') senescence influences yield and quality of annual crops. While a correlation between flowering/seed filling and whole-plant senescence has been observed in many annuals, it is unclear how the gene networks controlling these processes interact. Using near-isogenic germplasm, it has previously been demonstrated that a grain protein content (GPC) locus on barley chromosome 6 strongly influences the timing of post-anthesis flag leaf senescence, with high-GPC germplasm senescing early. Here, it is shown that the presence of high-GPC allele(s) at this locus also accelerates pre-anthesis plant development. While floral transition at the shoot apical meristem (SAM; determined by the presence of double ridges) occurred simultaneously, subsequent development was faster in the high- than in the low-GPC line, and anthesis occurred on average 5 d earlier. Similarly, sequential (pre-anthesis) leaf senescence was slightly accelerated, but only after differences in SAM development became visible. Leaf expression levels of four candidate genes (from a list of genes differentially regulated in post-anthesis flag leaves) were much higher in the high-GPC line even before faster development of the SAM became visible. One of these genes may be a functional homologue of Arabidopsis glycine-rich RNA-binding protein 7, which has previously been implicated in the promotion of flowering. Together, the data establish that the GPC locus influences pre- and post-anthesis barley development and senescence, and set the stage for a more detailed analysis of the interactions between the molecular networks controlling these important life history traits.

In the hip joint simulator test, the acetabular cups articulating on zirconia heads showed consistently lower volume changes than the cups articulating on stainless steel heads.

3320;25127902;Over-testing for heparin induced thrombocytopenia in hospitalized patients.;Heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a pro-thrombotic and potentially fatal complication of heparin therapy. Its diagnosis rests on high clinical probability and the laboratory demonstration of anti-PF4/heparin antibodies. The high prevalence of thrombocytopenia in hospitalized patients and the high sensitivity but low specificity of immunoassays for HIT antibodies can lead to over-testing and over-diagnosis. We conducted a study to review HIT screening practices in a tertiary care setting. We reviewed 63 consecutive patients undergoing testing for anti-PF4/heparin antibodies over 3 months. Pre-test probability for HIT was calculated using the 4T score. Sixty three patients underwent testing for anti-PF4/heparin antibodies. Twenty one had been admitted for cardiovascular surgery, 5 for other surgery and 35 for non-surgical indications. Twenty nine patients (46 %) had low pre- test probability, twenty three (36.5 %) had intermediate probability, and eleven (17.4 %) had high pre-test probability of having HIT. Anti-PF4/heparin ELISA was positive in 8 of 63 patients. SRA was ordered for 16 patients and was positive in 5. Only five patients were diagnosed and treated for HIT. Over-testing for HIT is highly prevalent in a tertiary care setting. This increases cost and exposes patients to expensive anti-coagulation with its attendant risk of hemorrhage. The 4Ts score has been shown to have high sensitivity and may be used to rule out HIT in most situations, although its utility depends on subjective analysis. Consistently applying this in practice could minimize over-testing and facilitate safer, cost-effective care.;-;-;-;hard_0

All strains grew in ten carbon sources (D-glucose, D-galactose, arbutin, maltose, sucrose, D-melezitose, D-xylose, D-mannitol, D-glucitol, and meso-inositol), and also grew at 37 degrees C and produced urease and phenoloxidase.

3322;3198591;Amino acid sequence of the triple-helical domain of human collagen type VI.;The complete amino acid sequence of the triple-helical domain of human collagen VI was deduced from sequences of appropriate cDNA clones and confirmed to about 50% by Edman degradation of tryptic peptides. This domain consists of three different peptide segments containing some 335-336 amino acid residues originating from central portions of the alpha 1 (VI), alpha 2(VI), and alpha 3(VI) chains, respectively. Sequence identity in the X/Y positions of the Gly-X-Y repeats is rather low (10-15%) between the chains. Peculiar features of these sequences include 3 cysteine residues about 50 (alpha 3(VI)) and 89 (alpha 1(VI), alpha 2(VI)) residues away from the N-terminus and several Gly-X-Y interruptions clustered in the C-terminal two-thirds of the triple helix. These structures are presumably required for cross-linking collagen VI oligomers and for super-coiling of triple helices in the dimers. Other features include 11 Arg-Gly-Asp sequences, some of which are likely to be used as cell-binding sites, and four Asn-X-Thr sequences, allowing N-linked glycosylation along the triple helix. Junctional areas close to the helix contain short, cysteine-rich segments which may seal the triple-helical domain through disulfide bond formation, endowing it with high stability. These features, together with a low sequence homology to fiber-forming and basement-membrane collagens, document the unique character of collagen VI, whose triple helix is specifically adjusted for forming microfibrils in tissues.;polycysteine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
3323;7756993;Conservation of polyproline II helices in homologous proteins: implications for structure prediction by model building.;"Left-handed polyproline II (PPII) helices commonly occur in globular proteins in segments of 4-8 residues. This paper analyzes the structural conservation of PPII-helices in 3 protein families: serine proteinases, aspartic proteinases, and immunoglobulin constant domains. Calculations of the number of conserved segments based on structural alignment of homologous molecules yielded similar results for the PPII-helices, the alpha-helices, and the beta-strands. The PPII-helices are consistently conserved at the level of 100-80% in the proteins with sequence identity above 20% and RMS deviation of structure alignments below 3.0 A. The most structurally important PPII segments are conserved below this level of sequence identity. These results suggest that the PPII-helices, in addition to the other 2 secondary structure classes, should be identified as part of structurally conserved regions in proteins. This is supported by similar values for the local RMS deviations of the aligned segments for the structural classes of PPII-helices, alpha-helices, and beta-strands. The PPII-helices are shown to participate in supersecondary elements such as PPII-helix/alpha-helix. The conservation of PPII-helices depends on the conservation of a supersecondary element as a whole. PPII-helices also form links, possibly flexible, in the interdomain regions. The role of the PPII-helices in model building by homology is 2-fold; they serve as additional conserved elements in the structure allowing improvement of the accuracy of a model and provide correct chain geometry for modeling of the segments equivalenced to them in a target sequence. The improvement in model building is demonstrated in 2 test studies.";polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function

3330;35320517;Galectins: An Ancient Family of Carbohydrate Binding Proteins with Modern Functions.;Galectins are a large family of carbohydrate binding proteins with members in nearly every lineage of multicellular life. Through tandem and en-mass genome duplications, over 15 known vertebrate galectins likely evolved from a single common ancestor extant in pre-chordate lineages. While galectins have divergently evolved numerous functions, some of which do not involve carbohydrate recognition, the vast majority of the galectins have retained the conserved ability to bind variably modified polylactosamine (polyLacNAc) residues on glycans that modify proteins and lipids on the surface of host cells and pathogens. In addition to their direct role in microbial killing, many proposed galectin functions in the immune system and cancer involve crosslinking glycosylated receptors and modifying signaling pathways or sensitivity to antigen from the outside in. However, a large body of work has uncovered intracellular galectin functions mediated by carbohydrate- and non-carbohydrate-dependent interactions. In the cytoplasm, galectins can tune intracellular kinase and G-protein-coupled signaling cascades important for nutrient sensing, cell cycle progression, and transformation. Particularly, but interconnected pathways, cytoplasmic galectins serve the innate immune system as sensors of endolysosomal damage, recruiting and assembling the components of autophagosomes during intracellular infection through carbohydrate-dependent and -independent activities. In the nucleus, galectins participate in pre-mRNA splicing perhaps through interactions with non-coding RNAs required for assembly of spliceosomes. Together, studies of galectin function paint a picture of a functionally dynamic protein family recruited during eons of evolution to regulate numerous essential cellular processes in the context of multicellular life.;polyleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

Copper azide (CA), one of the most promising primary explosives, is restricted in practical applications because of its high electrostatic sensitivity and the method of charge in micro-initiation systems. To tackle these issues, two synthetic paths of CA based on a porous graphene skeleton are proposed. First, a viscous homogeneous mixed solution is rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen to form a spherical copper-containing precursor material. The copper azide/carbon/graphene composite (CA/C/GA) was fabricated by freeze-drying, high-temperature thermal decomposition andin situazidation. Second, A cylindrical copper/graphene gel formed by high-temperature hydrothermal self-assembly is served as a precursor material. Also, hydrogen reduction andin situazidation procedures were utilized to synthesize copper azide@graphene foam (CA@GF). Detailed characterization indicates that the excellent performance of composite materials is ascribed to the excellent electrical and thermal conductivity of graphene material. The electrostatic sensitivities of CA/C/GA and CA@GF were 3.6 mJ and 2.5 mJ, respectively, and the flame sensitivity was 50 cm.

3337;19318583;Human ZNF312b promotes the progression of gastric cancer by transcriptional activation of the K-ras gene.;"Gastric cancer ranks second among the most common causes of cancer deaths worldwide. Recent studies reported target molecules that are candidates for new therapeutic interventions; however, their molecular mechanism has not been clearly defined. In this study, we found that ZNF312b plays a role in tumor progression and metastasis in gastric cancer via transcriptional activation of the K-ras oncogene. ZNF312b seems to be specifically overexpressed in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines. The overexpression of ZNF312b induces cancer-like phenotypes, including accelerated proliferation and increased tumor masses in nude mice, which are completely reversed by its knockdown in gastric cancer cell lines, implying direct involvement in gastric tumor progression. From analyses using deletion mutants of ZNF312b and K-ras promoter-driven luciferase reporters, we found that it translocates into the nucleus via the proline-rich domain of its COOH terminus to activate transcription of the K-ras gene, resulting in an enhancement of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway that governs cell proliferation. Taken together, these results suggest that ZNF312b contributes to the promotion of gastric cancer by triggering K-ras oncogene expression. The current study is the first to report that ZNF312b, a novel transcription factor, was associated with tumorigenicity of gastric cancer. This might be a valuable target that could provide new insight into the development of new therapeutic modalities for patients with gastric cancer.

3339;9516953;Treatment of metastatic bone pain with tin-117m Stannic diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid: a phase I/II clinical study.;The physical characteristics of Sn-117m combined with the biodistribution of the compound tin-117m (Stannic, 4+) diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Sn-117m DTPA) suggest that it should be an excellent agent for the palliation of pain from bony metastases. Prior work has established the dosimetry and the safety for the material in human beings. The presence of low-energy conversion electrons should result in the relative sparing of the bone marrow while delivering a high radiation dose to sites of bony metastatic disease. Forty-seven patients with painful bone metastases from various malignancies were treated with Sn-117m DTPA. The patients were assigned to five different dose levels ranging from 2.64 to 10.58 MBq (71-286 microCi) per kg of body weight. Follow-up included review of pain diaries, performance scores, analgesic requirements, blood chemistries, and hematological assessment. Three patients received a second treatment. There was an overall response rate for relief of pain of 75% (range, 60-83%) in the 40 treatments that could be evaluated. No correlation was apparent in this limited series between response rate and the five dose levels used. The relief was complete in 12 patients (30%). The time to onset of pain relief was 19 +/- 15 days with doses < or = 5.29 MBq/kg and 5 +/- 3 days with doses > or = 6.61 MBq/kg. Myelotoxicity was minimal, with only one patient having a marginal grade 3 WBC toxicity. On the basis of our data, Sn-117m DTPA should be an effective and safe radiopharmaceutical for palliation of painful bony metastases. A large-scale trial is warranted to evaluate it in comparison to other similar agents.;-;-;-;hard_0
3340;15308737;Biophysical and mutational analysis of the putative bZIP domain of Epstein-Barr virus EBNA 3C.;Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 3C (EBNA 3C) is essential for B-cell immortalization and functions as a regulator of viral and cellular transcription. EBNA 3C contains glutamine-rich and proline-rich domains and a region in the N terminus consisting of a stretch of basic residues followed by a run of leucine residues spaced seven amino acids apart. This N-terminal domain is widely believed to represent a leucine zipper dimerization motif (bZIP). We have performed the first structural and functional analysis of this motif and demonstrated that this domain is not capable of forming stable homodimers. Peptides encompassing the EBNA 3C zipper domain are approximately 54 to 67% alpha-helical in solution but cannot form dimers at physiologically relevant concentrations. Moreover, the EBNA 3C leucine zipper cannot functionally substitute for another homodimerizing zipper domain in domain-swapping experiments. Our data indicate, however, that the EBNA 3C zipper domain behaves as an atypical bZIP domain and is capable of self-associating to form higher-order alpha-helical oligomers. Using directed mutagenesis, we also identified a new role for the bZIP domain in maintaining the interaction between EBNA 3C and RBP-Jkappa in vivo. Disruption of the helical nature of the zipper domain by the introduction of proline residues reduces the ability of EBNA 3C to inhibit EBNA 2 activation and interact with RBP-Jkappa in vivo by 50%, and perturbation of the charge on the basic region completely abolishes this function of EBNA 3C. ;polyproline;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
3342;26593359;Transferability of Various Molecular Property Tensors in Vibrational Spectroscopy.;Transfers of polarizability, dipole, and energy derivatives from smaller fragments enable extension of ab initio vibrational spectral simulations to larger molecules. The accuracy of the transfer, however, varies according to the molecule and the tensor type. Recent works (J. Chem. Theory Comput.2011, 7, 1867 and Coll. Czech. Chem. Commun.2011, 76, 567) questioned the accuracy of the tensor transfer for Raman optical activity (ROA) spectra. To estimate relative errors, the current study systematically compares transfer properties for four spectral types (ROA, Raman, vibrational circular dichroism (VCD), and infrared absorption (IR)). As test molecules, polyglycine and polyproline peptides in polyproline II and α-helical conformations were used. The results indicate that the discrepancies could be caused by variation of the transfer parameters but not by fundamental differences in the ROA tensor properties. In particular, when done consistently, the transferred electric and magnetic dipole derivatives, polarizability tensors, and harmonic force field provided a reasonable convergence of all spectra for transfers with increasing sizes of the fragments. The polarized spectroscopies (VCD and ROA), however, were found to be significantly more sensitive than the unpolarized (IR, Raman) ones. Optimization of the geometry and the character of the amino acid side chain was relatively unimportant for the transfer. On the other hand, intramolecular hydrogen bonds in the helix required larger fragments for the same accuracy than in an unfolded peptide. Nevertheless, with reasonable fragmentation, all the spectra (IR, VCD, Raman, and ROA) of the target structures could be reconstructed to an accuracy sufficient for a full interpretation of the experiment, with substantial savings of computer time as an added benefit.  ;polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function
3344;17951469;In utero and postnatal exposure to long chain (n-3) PUFA enhances intestinal glucose absorption and energy stores in weanling pigs.;"The aim of this research was to determine whether feeding gestating and lactating sows (n-3) PUFA [eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and/or docosahexenoic acid (DHA)] or coconut fat (saturated fat) influences ex vivo glucose absorption in the proximal jejunum and glucose and glycogen concentration of liver and muscle of their offspring at weaning. Sows were fed 1 of 4 diets for 150 d, which included the entire gestation and lactation periods. The diets consisted of basal corn/soybean meal (CONT), CONT + protected EPA and DHA-rich fish oil (PFO), CONT + DHA Gold fat (DHAGF), and CONT + coconut fat (COCO). All tissues were collected from piglets (n = 4 per treatment) following a 24-h period of food deprivation, which was initiated at weaning. Proximal jejunum samples were mounted in modified Ussing chambers for transport determinations. Relative to the CONT (7 muA/cm(2)), active glucose transport was greater (P = 0.013) in piglets from sows fed the PFO (30 microA/cm(2)) and DHAGF (40 microA/cm(2)) diets, but not the COCO diet (19 microA/cm(2); pooled SEM = 5). Likewise, jejunum expression of glucose transporter 2 and sodium glucose transporter 1 protein tended (P < 0.10) to be greater in piglets from dams fed the PFO and DHAGF diets, as did AMP-activated protein kinase activity. Piglets' muscle glycogen was greater than in CONT (34 +/- 5.2 mg/g wet tissue) only in piglets from dams fed the DHAGF (46 +/- 5.2 mg/g wet tissue; P < 0.05). These results indicate that (n-3) PUFA, particularly DHA, improves intestinal glucose absorption and muscle glycogen concentrations in newly weaned pigs. These findings may also have important implications for human mothers and infants. ";polyalanine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
3349;36120217;Intravenous Lobular Capillary Hemangioma: A Case Report and Proposal for New Cutaneous Tender Tumor Differential Diagnosis Acronym.;"Here, we report a case of a 70-year-old female who presented with a slowly enlarging tender nodule on the right forearm for several months. Physical examination showed a faintly blue-tinged freely mobile subcutaneous nodule. Excision was complicated by greater than expected bleeding and revealed an unexpected intravenous mass. Histopathology demonstrated capillary lobules separated by fibrous septae within a vein, consistent with intravenous lobular capillary hemangioma (IVLCH). IVLCH is a rare benign capillary proliferation of unclear etiology. Excision is typically curative and relieves any pain and discomfort the patient might be experiencing. With the addition of IVLCH, we respectfully propose a new acronym for the differential diagnosis of cutaneous tender tumors: intravenous lobular capillary hemangioma, foreign body (reaction), hidradenoma, osteoma cutis, glomus tumor, scar, fibromyxoma, leiomyosarcoma, eccrine angiomatous hamartoma, Dercum's disease (adiposis dolorosa), piezogenic pedal papule, eccrine spiradenoma, neurilemmoma (schwannoma), calcinosis cutis, angioendotheliomatosis, leiomyoma, metastases, angiolipoma, neuroma, dermatofibroma, granular cell tumor, endometriosis, thrombus, blue rubber bleb nevus, angioma, chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis, and keloid (""IF HOGS FLED PEN, CALM AND GET BACK""). Future additions to the cutaneous tender tumor differential diagnosis may require creative additions and rearrangements to this acronym.

3350;22797253;Temporally designed treatment of melanoma cells by ATRA and polyI: C results in enhanced chemokine and IFNβ secretion controlled differently by TLR3 and MDA5.;In the last three decades, the incidence of melanoma has increased worldwide and no effective treatment modalities have been developed yet. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) are strong inducers of toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and MDA5 expression, and polyI:C-induced TLR3 and MDA5 signaling specifically causes cell death in melanoma cells in vitro. We addressed the question of whether ATRA pretreatment could enhance the efficacy of polyI:C and, if so, would ATRA have any additional effects on this process. We found that the combined treatment of human melanoma cells with ATRA and polyI:C strongly increased the expression of TLR3 and MDA5 in both WM35 and WM983A cells associated with significantly higher mRNA and secreted levels of interferon β (IFNβ), CXCL1, CXCL8/IL-8, CXCL9, and CXCL10 than cells treated with either ATRA or polyI:C. Silencing of MDA5 by siRNA moderately affected IFNβ secretion, whereas TLR3 knockdown interfered with both CXCL chemokine and IFNβ production. Furthermore, the supernatants of ATRA+polyI:C-activated cultures increased the migration of both human monocyte-derived macrophages and CD1a dendritic cells significantly as compared with the supernatants of cells treated with either ATRA or polyI:C, and this effect occurred in a TLR3-dependent manner. In conclusion, consecutive treatment with ATRA and polyI:C results in strong, TLR3/MDA5-mediated chemokine and IFN responses in cultured human melanoma cells, which triggers a functional migratory response in professional antigen-presenting cells. This novel mode of concomitant activation may represent a more efficient treatment option for future melanoma therapy. ;polyisoleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

Neither the extent of oligodendrocyte remyelination nor the thickness of myelin sheath formed by remyelinating oligodendrocytes was affected by hypothyroidism. However, the extent of remyelination carried out by Schwann cells was decreased in hypothyroid rats compared with normal control animals.;-;-;-;hard_0
3356;8222763;Fibrinolysis in patients with acute ischaemic heart disease. With particular reference to systemic effects of tissue-type plasminogen activator treatment on fibrinolysis, coagulation and complement pathways.;The plasminogen activator systems in the blood, the coagulation system, and the complement pathways are reviewed. The review describes the role of the vascular intima in activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis and the interrelations between the complement system and haemostatic mechanisms. Physiological activation of fibrinolysis may be triggered by and limited to fibrin because of a special affinity of plasminogen and plasminogen activators. The binding of plasminogen to fibrin is regulated by histidine-rich glycoprotein, and the primary physiological inhibitor of generated plasmin is alpha 2-antiplasmin and especially the plasminogen-binding form of this immediate plasmin inhibitor. Plasminogen activator inhibitors in the blood, that is, notably plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1), bind circulating tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA). However, local fibrinolysis in vivo mediated by t-PA may be independent of complex formation between plasminogen activator inhibitors and t-PA in the fluid phase. Circulating plasminogen activator inhibitors might regulate fibrinolysis by increasing the clearance of t-PA from the blood. The urokinase-type and factor XII-dependent fibrinolytic proactivator system can be activated following t-PA-mediated generation of plasmin, and could thus serve as an amplification system of t-PA-induced fibrinolysis. It is claimed that the as yet uncharacterized proactivator is essential for optimal generation of plasminogen activator activity by the factor XII-dependent fibrinolytic system. The normal antithrombotic condition of the vascular intima probably results from lack of tissue factor activity and the presence of significant antithrombotic components comprising, among others, antithrombin III and the protein C-protein S system. A number of pathophysiologic stimuli, notably mediators of the acute phase response such as the cytokines interleukin-1 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (cachectin), have the potential to induce the vascular endothelium to express procoagulant activity. Vascular endothelium promoting coagulant activity releases increased amounts of t-PA antigen and PAI-1 antigen into the circulation, and elevated levels in the blood of both may be regarded as a marker of a generalized procoagulant condition involving the vascular endothelium. In a prospective study in patients with unstable angina pectoris, patients in whom disease progresses and acute myocardial infarction develops, have increased amounts of t-PA antigen and PAI-1 antigen in the blood. This suggests that the procoagulant potential and atherosclerotic process of the vascular intima is more pronounced in the risk group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) ;polyhistidine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
3357;7713325;Protein kinase A is a positive regulator of spore coat gene transcription in Dictyostelium.;The cotA, cotB, and cotC genes encode the major spore coat proteins of Dictyostelium. All three cot genes are coordinately expressed as aggregation is nearing completion. Induction and maintenance of their expression is dependent upon the presence of extracellular cAMP. We show that expression of a dominant inhibitor of the cAMP dependent protein kinase (PKA) in prespore cells greatly reduces the transcription rates of the cotB and cotC genes. All three cot genes contain, in their upstream regulatory regions, short sequence elements that have a high content of cytosine and adenosine residues. These CA-rich sequences are essential for optimal cot gene transcription. We show that expression of the dominant PKA inhibitor results in a greatly reduced level of the binding activity that recognizes the CA-rich sequences upstream of the cotB gene. Thus PKA acts, either directly or indirectly, to control expression of the cot genes and it may do so by modulating the activity of a DNA binding protein. However, we find that mutant cells where PKA is constitutively active still require exogenous cAMP for optimal cot gene expression in dissociated cells, suggesting that a separate, PKA-independent, signalling pathway is also involved in the regulation of cot gene expression by extracellular cAMP. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
3360;9590534;Casein kinase II activity of buffalo sperm chromatin.;Two cyclic AMP-independent protein kinase activities have been found associated with buffalo sperm chromatin: a histone kinase highly specific for arginine-rich histone was reported recently (Mudgal et al., 1997: Arch Andrology 38:191-199) and a casein kinase II is described here. Casein kinase activity was solubilized with 0.35 M NaCl, which extracted 90% of the initial enzyme activity associated with buffalo sperm chromatin. Of the two acidic proteins tested, casein was preferred substrate over phosvitin. Among the casein fractions, the order of preference for casein kinase was beta-casein > alpha-casein > casein. Cyclic AMP at concentrations up to 50 microM had no effect on the phosphorylation of casein. Phosphoamino acid analysis using casein as the substrate showed threonine to be the acceptor amino acid for phosphoester link. Phosphorylation specificity was determined by phosphorylating buffalo beta-casein followed by the preparation of tryptic peptides and identification of amino acid residue phosphorylated. Threonine residue at position 41 having clusters of acidic amino acid residues (Thr. Glu. Asp. Glu) C-terminal to it was phosphorylated, a phosphorylation specificity akin to CKII. It is thought that phosphorylation of histones decreases their association with DNA and probably makes the DNA more available for replication, while phosphorylation of nonhistone proteins modifies their interaction with histones, allowing control of template activity. Two protein kinases found in buffalo sperm chromatin may perform a similar function.;polyarginine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
3362;28107777;The DC1-domain protein VACUOLELESS GAMETOPHYTES is essential for development of female and male gametophytes in Arabidopsis.;"In this work we identified VACUOLELESS GAMETOPHYTES (VLG) as a DC1 domain-containing protein present in the endomembrane system and essential for development of both female and male gametophytes. VLG was originally annotated as a gene coding for a protein of unknown function containing DC1 domains. DC1 domains are cysteine- and histidine-rich zinc finger domains found exclusively in the plant kingdom that have been named on the basis of similarity with the C1 domain present in protein kinase C (PKC). In Arabidopsis, both male and female gametophytes are characterized by the formation of a large vacuole early in development; this is absent in vlg mutant plants. As a consequence, development is arrested in embryo sacs and pollen grains at the first mitotic division. VLG is specifically located in multivesicular bodies or pre-vacuolar compartments, and our results suggest that vesicular fusion is affected in the mutants, disrupting vacuole formation. Supporting this idea, AtPVA12 - a member of the SNARE vesicle-associated protein family and previously related to a sterol-binding protein, was identified as a VLG interactor. A role for VLG is proposed mediating vesicular fusion in plants as part of the sterol trafficking machinery required for vacuole biogenesis in plants. ";polyhistidine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
3364;26521890;Characterization of the Neospora caninum NcROP40 and NcROP2Fam-1 rhoptry proteins during the tachyzoite lytic cycle.;Virulence factors from the ROP2-family have been extensively studied in Toxoplasma gondii, but in the closely related Neospora caninum only NcROP2Fam-1 has been partially characterized to date. NcROP40 is a member of this family and was found to be more abundantly expressed in virulent isolates. Both NcROP2Fam-1 and NcROP40 were evaluated as vaccine candidates and exerted a synergistic effect in terms of protection against vertical transmission in mouse models, which suggests that they may be relevant for parasite pathogenicity. NcROP40 is localized in the rhoptry bulbs of tachyzoites and bradyzoites, but in contrast to NcROP2Fam-1, the protein does not associate with the parasitophorous vacuole membrane due to the lack of arginine-rich amphipathic helix in its sequence. Similarly to NcROP2Fam-1, NcROP40 mRNA levels are highly increased during tachyzoite egress and invasion. However, NcROP40 up-regulation does not appear to be linked to the mechanisms triggering egress. In contrast to NcROP2Fam-1, phosphorylation of NcROP40 was not observed during egress. Besides, NcROP40 secretion into the host cell was not successfully detected by immunofluorescence techniques. These findings indicate that NcROP40 and NcROP2Fam-1 carry out different functions, and highlight the need to elucidate the role of NcROP40 within the lytic cycle and to explain its relative abundance in tachyzoites.  ;polyarginine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
3366;18250086;Probing the mechanism of recognition of ssDNA by the Cdc13-DBD.;The Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein Cdc13 tightly and specifically binds the conserved G-rich single-stranded overhang at telomeres and plays an essential role in telomere end-protection and length regulation. The 200 residue DNA-binding domain of Cdc13 (Cdc13-DBD) binds an 11mer single-stranded representative of the yeast telomeric sequence [Tel11, d(GTGTGGGTGTG)] with a 3 pM affinity and specificity for three bases (underlined) at the 5' end. The structure of the Cdc13-DBD bound to Tel11 revealed a large, predominantly aromatic protein interface with several unusual features. The DNA adopts an irregular, extended structure, and the binding interface includes a long ( approximately 30 amino acids) structured loop between strands beta2-beta3 (L(2-3)) of an OB-fold. To investigate the mechanism of ssDNA binding, we studied the free and bound states of Cdc13-DBD using NMR spectroscopy. Chemical shift changes indicate that the basic topology of the domain, including L(2-3), is essentially intact in the free state. Changes in slow and intermediate time scale dynamics, however, occur in L(2-3), while conformational changes distant from the DNA interface suggest an induced fit mechanism for binding in the 'hot spot' for binding affinity and specificity. These data point to an overall binding mechanism well adapted to the heterogeneous nature of yeast telomeres. ;polyglycine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
3368;9171086;The sequence specificity of alkylation for a series of benzoic acid mustard and imidazole-containing distamycin analogues: the importance of local sequence conformation.;The covalent sequence specificity of a series of nitrogen mustard and imidazole-containing analogues of distamycin was determined using modified sequencing techniques. The analogues tether benzoic acid mustard (BAM) and possess either one, two or three imidazole units. Examination of the alkylation specificity revealed that BAM produced guanine-N7 lesions in a pattern similar to conventional nitrogen mustards. The monoimidazole-BAM conjugate also produced guanine-N7 alkylation in a similar pattern to BAM, but at a 100-fold lower dose. The diimidazole and triimidazole conjugates did not produce detectable guanine-N7 alkylation but only alkylated at selected sites in the minor groove. Unexpectedly, the alkylation specificity at equivalent doses was nearly identical to that found for the previously reported pyrrole-BAM conjugates. The consensus sequence, 5'-TTTTGPuwas strongly alkylated by the triimidazole conjugate in preference to other similar sites including three occurrences of 5'-TTTTAA. Footprinting studies were carried out to examine the non-covalent DNA binding interactions. These studies revealed that the tripyrrole- BAM conjugate bound non-covalently to the same AT-rich sites as distamycin. In contrast, whereas the Im3lexitropsin bound non-covalently to GC-rich sequences, the triimidazole-BAM conjugate did not detectably footprint to either GC- or AT-rich regions at equivalent doses. The results indicate that the alkylation event is not solely dictated by the non-covalent binding and might be influenced by a unique sequence dependent conformational feature of the consensus sequence 5'-TTTTGPu. ;polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

We now describe anti-inflammatory properties of QM56 in mouse kidney and renal cell models.In cultured murine tubular cells, QM56 inhibited the inflammatory response to Tweak, a non-apoptotic stimulus. Tweak induced MCP-1 and Rantes synthesis through JAK2 kinase and NF-κB activation. Similar to JAK2 kinase inhibitors, QM56 inhibited Tweak-induced NF-κB transcriptional activity and chemokine expression, despite failing to inhibit NF-κB-p65 nuclear translocation and NF-κB DNA binding. QM56 prevented JAK2 activation and NF-κB-p65(Ser536) phosphorylation. The anti-inflammatory effect and JAK2 inhibition by QM56 were observed in Apaf-1(-/-) cells. In murine acute kidney injury, QM56 decreased tubular cell apoptosis and kidney inflammation as measured by down-modulations of MCP-1 and Rantes mRNA expression, immune cell infiltration and activation of the JAK2-dependent inflammatory pathway.In conclusion, QM56 has an anti-inflammatory activity which is independent from its role as inhibitor of Apaf-1 and apoptosis and may have potential therapeutic relevance. ;polyglutamic;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

3376;35269133;Study of Wear Phenomenon of a Dental Milling Cutter by Statistical-Mathematical Modeling Based on the Experimental Results.;"The wear phenomenon of a dental milling cutter is studied based on experimental results and data and validated by statistical-mathematical modeling. The results of the statistical-mathematical modeling by the interpolation of the experimental results (data) regarding the wear of the dental milling cutter analyzed and obtained in the work process are presented in this paper. These results (data) are important because they lead to polynomial functions which by interpolation approximate very well the dependent parameter, specifically the wear process (mass lost due to dental milling cutter wear, m), considered in the experimental program. The polynomial interpolation functions are valid, only during the experimental testing range of the dental milling cutter, to describe the wear phenomenon; the extrapolations do not lead to satisfactory results. However, by using a controlled interpolation function with an exponential component, the extrapolation of the results is possible. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is the statistical-mathematical modeling by the interpolation of the experimental results of the mass lost due to dental milling cutter wear, m, using the deterministic differential model for the work process of it. Thus, interesting conclusions can be drawn relating to the phenomenon. In support of these statements come the results of the statistical-mathematical modeling by the interpolation of the experimental data obtained in the work process of the dental milling cutters, leading to practical applications, such as the extension of the life of dental milling cutter, useful even for its operation optimization; determination of possible criteria for replacing the worn dental milling cutters; the extension of the life of the materials from which dental milling cutters are built; or the provision of ideas for constructive solutions. Based on the modeling results by interpolation, it was found that the dental milling cutter during the milling operation works with high efficiency (mass loss due to wear is very reduced) in the first 11 h of operation, i.e., about a 10% increase in lifetime. After 11 h of operation, mass loss due to wear of the dental milling cutter increases relatively exponentially; thus, it is recommended that, in the normal way, the dental milling cutter be replaced with a new one to ensure high standards of materials processing.";-;-;-;hard_0
3378;9250422;Pharmacokinetics and administration regimens of vancomycin in neonates, infants and children.;"The increased use of vancomycin in neonatal and paediatric patients has prompted numerous pharmacokinetic studies and the development of many empirical administration methods. The majority of dosage guidelines use the relationship between pharmacokinetic parameters and patient variables such as chronological age, bodyweight, and/or measures of renal function. Currently, those dosage guidelines which are based upon postconceptional age and bodyweight seem to provide the best options for empirical administration in neonates and infants. In addition, serum creatinine may prove to be a useful guide to the empirical administration of vancomycin in neonates older than 7 to 14 days. Several investigators have reported the individualisation of dosage regimens based on pharmacokinetic-based administration methods. The most common techniques employed have been Sawchuk-Zaske method and Bayesian forecasting. However, only a limited number of studies have evaluated either empirical administration or individualised administration techniques in patient populations outside those of the original reports; this makes choosing between the methods difficult. Pharmacokinetic data and administration recommendations have gradually become available in special paediatric patient populations. The majority of studies have focused on patients requiring cardiopulmonary bypass surgery or with burns, cancer or central nervous system infections. However, a limited amount of information is available regarding vancomycin disposition in children older than 1 year of age with and without end-stage renal failure. The monitoring of serum vancomycin concentrations may be useful in selected neonatal and paediatric patient populations, especially where large interpatient variability occurs and administration guidelines are not clearly established. Similar to the literature on adults, the lack of conclusive evidence concerning the relationship between serum vancomycin concentrations and therapeutic responses leaves this topic open to debate.";-;-;-;hard_0
3380;1644831;Domains regulating transcriptional activity of the inducible orphan receptor NGFI-B.;"NGFI-B is an early response gene which encodes a protein that has strong homology with nuclear receptors in the DNA binding domain and in carboxyl-terminal domains responsible for ligand binding and regulation of transcriptional activity. Previously, we have demonstrated that NGFI-B is transcriptionally active in cells grown in vitro in the absence of exogenously added ligand. However, the ligand for NGFI-B does not appear to be a component of cell culture medium, as NGFI-B remained active when expressed in cells grown in medium lacking phenol red, serum, essential vitamins, or essential amino acids. To define the transactivation domains, a mutational analysis was conducted which revealed that a serine/threonine-rich area of 18 amino acids within the amino terminus, termed TAB-1, is an important transcriptional activation domain. The mutation of two adjacent serine and threonine residues within TAB-1 significantly decreased transactivation by NGFI-B. An examination of the role of the carboxyl terminus in regulating NGFI-B transcriptional activity revealed that, in accordance with other nuclear receptors, mutants lacking portions of the carboxyl terminus had greatly decreased activity. The similarity with other receptors was further supported by studies with the mutant B delta 414-597 which encodes a fully active, truncated receptor analogous to a hormone-independent, constitutively active glucocorticoid receptor truncation mutant. This NGFI-B truncation mutant had activity similar to wild type NGFI-B in a number of mammalian cell lines; however, in contrast, it was 8-fold more active than the wild type receptor in the Drosophila S2 cell line, suggesting that insect cells either lack the NGFI-B ligand or obligatory accessory factors.";polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

It was found that the major carbohydrate chains have a novel polysaccharide structure, consisting of a branched disaccharide repeating unit containing 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D- galactopyranose (beta-D-Galp-NAc) and beta-D-glucopyranuronic acid (beta-D-GlcpA). [formula: see text] The major antigenic character of CAA arises from this novel polysaccharide, which was shown to be an absolutely specific diagnostic marker in schistosomiasis. The cross-reactivity of CAA with anti-CCA (circulating cathodic antigen) monoclonal antibodies is caused by the presence of a small amount of O-linked CCA-poly-Lewis x carbohydrate chains on the CAA protein chain. ;polyleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

3387;18383681;The grid-dose-spreading algorithm for dose distribution calculation in heavy charged particle radiotherapy.;A new variant of the pencil-beam (PB) algorithm for dose distribution calculation for radiotherapy with protons and heavier ions, the grid-dose spreading (GDS) algorithm, is proposed. The GDS algorithm is intrinsically faster than conventional PB algorithms due to approximations in convolution integral, where physical calculations are decoupled from simple grid-to-grid energy transfer. It was effortlessly implemented to a carbon-ion radiotherapy treatment planning system to enable realistic beam blurring in the field, which was absent with the broad-beam (BB) algorithm. For a typical prostate treatment, the slowing factor of the GDS algorithm relative to the BB algorithm was 1.4, which is a great improvement over the conventional PB algorithms with a typical slowing factor of several tens. The GDS algorithm is mathematically equivalent to the PB algorithm for horizontal and vertical coplanar beams commonly used in carbon-ion radiotherapy while dose deformation within the size of the pristine spread occurs for angled beams, which was within 3 mm for a single 150-MeV proton pencil beam of 30 degrees incidence, and needs to be assessed against the clinical requirements and tolerances in practical situations.;-;-;-;hard_0
3390;19416856;Sustained activation of XBP1 splicing leads to endothelial apoptosis and atherosclerosis development in response to disturbed flow.;X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) is a key signal transducer in endoplasmic reticulum stress response, and its potential role in the atherosclerosis development is unknown. This study aims to explore the impact of XBP1 on maintaining endothelial integrity related to atherosclerosis and to delineate the underlying mechanism. We found that XBP1 was highly expressed at branch points and areas of atherosclerotic lesions in the arteries of ApoE(-/-) mice, which was related to the severity of lesion development. In vitro study using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) indicated that disturbed flow increased the activation of XBP1 expression and splicing. Overexpression of spliced XBP1 induced apoptosis of HUVECs and endothelial loss from blood vessels during ex vivo cultures because of caspase activation and down-regulation of VE-cadherin resulting from transcriptional suppression and matrix metalloproteinase-mediated degradation. Reconstitution of VE-cadherin by Ad-VEcad significantly increased Ad-XBP1s-infected HUVEC survival. Importantly, Ad-XBP1s gene transfer to the vessel wall of ApoE(-/-) mice resulted in development of atherosclerotic lesions after aorta isografting. These results indicate that XBP1 plays an important role in maintaining endothelial integrity and atherosclerosis development, which provides a potential therapeutic target to intervene in atherosclerosis.;-;-;-;hard_0
3392;9312030;Three classes of mammalian transcription activation domain stimulate transcription in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.;Representatives of three distinct classes of mammalian protein domain activating RNA polymerase II were fused to the yeast GAL4p DNA-binding domain. The resulting fusion proteins were tested in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe for their ability to activate transcription of different reporter constructs containing GAL4-binding sites in positions close to or far from the TATA box. The acidic-rich activation domain of VP16 stimulates transcription in S.pombe from proximal and distal positions, suggesting that the mechanism of activation is conserved from man to budding and fission yeasts. Unlike in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the glutamine-rich activation domains of Sp1, Oct1 and Oct2 activate transcription in S. pombe when tested in a proximal TATA box context. Similarly to mammalian cells, these domains are inactive or weakly active when tested in a distal position. Moreover, the proline-rich activation domains of AP-2 and CTF/NF1 display strong transcriptional activities from a TATA box-proximal position, and weak activities when tested in a remote position. Consequently, proline-rich and glutamine-rich activation domains act differently in S.cerevisiae and mammalian cells, but similarly in S.pombe and mammalian cells.;polyproline;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
3393;3470736;Nucleolin, the major nucleolar protein of growing eukaryotic cells: an unusual protein structure revealed by the nucleotide sequence.;Nucleolin (also called C23) is the major nucleolar protein of exponentially growing eukaryotic cells. It is found associated with intranucleolar chromatin and preribosomal particles. Through use of a polyclonal antiserum, nucleolin cDNA clones were isolated from a Chinese hamster ovary cell library constructed in the expression vector lambda gt11. The isolated cDNAs encoded a polypeptide containing 679 residues of the 713 amino acids of nucleolin. The amino acid sequence presents several unusual features: in particular, repetitive sequences are found at both ends of the molecule. A repeat, Hy-Thr-Pro-Hy-Lys-Lys-Hy-Hy, in which Hy is a nonpolar residue, is found six times in the NH2-end proximal portion, followed by three acidic stretches containing 25, 25, and 33 glutamic acid or aspartic acid residues. Four potential phosphorylation sites (serines) are also observed in this region. The COOH-terminal proximal portion of the protein carries a glycine-rich region with fairly regularly interspersed phenylalanine and dimethylarginine residues. The two terminal portions of the molecule exhibit unique potential secondary structures: alpha-helix (NH2 terminus) and extended (COOH terminus). The central region exhibits alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic stretches. Five potential N glycosylation sites are detected. The structure of this protein may reflect two functions in preribosome biogenesis: interaction with chromatin (NH2 terminus) and with preribosomes (COOH terminus).; polyglycine ;helix;-;LCR_with_function

3396;11416181;Ribonucleoprotein infrastructure regulating the flow of genetic information between the genome and the proteome.;Following transcription and splicing, each mRNA of a mammalian cell passes into the cytoplasm where its fate is in the hands of a complex network of ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs). The success or failure of a gene to be expressed depends on the performance of this mRNP infrastructure. The entry, gating, processing, and transit of each mRNA through an mRNP network helps determine the composition of a cell's proteome. The machinery that regulates storage, turnover, and translational activation of mRNAs is not well understood, in part, because of the heterogeneous nature of mRNPs. Recently, subsets of cellular mRNAs clustered as members of mRNP complexes have been identified by using antibodies reactive with RNA-binding proteins, including ELAV/Hu, eIF-4E, and poly(A)-binding proteins. Cytoplasmic ELAV/Hu proteins are involved in the stability and translation of early response gene (ERG) transcripts and are expressed predominately in neurons. mRNAs recovered from ELAV/Hu mRNP complexes were found to have similar sequence elements, suggesting a common structural linkage among them. This approach opens the possibility of identifying transcripts physically clustered in vivo that may have similar fates or functions. Moreover, the proteins encoded by physically organized mRNAs may participate in the same biological process or structural outcome, not unlike operons and their polycistronic mRNAs do in prokaryotic organisms. Our goal is to understand the organization and flow of genetic information on an integrative systems level by analyzing the collective properties of proteins and mRNAs associated with mRNPs in vivo. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
3397;6320125;Mutational dissection of the 21 bp repeat region of the SV40 early promoter reveals that it contains overlapping elements of the early-early and late-early promoters.;Using quantitative S1 nuclease analysis and recombinants which contain the SV40 early promoter region linked to the rabbit beta-globin gene coding sequence, we have studied the effect of deletion, inversion and point mutations, located within the 21 bp repeat region, on initiation of transcription from the early-early and late-early startsites in the absence of T-antigen. Our data establish unequivocally that the six GC-rich repeats present in the 21 bp repeat region are essential elements of both the early-early and late-early promoters and that they are not redundant, since mutations, which affect only the GC-rich repeat most proximal to the TATA box, decrease drastically the activity of the early-early promoter, but increase that of the late-early promoter. On the other hand, the four GC-rich repeats most proximal to the 72 bp repeat are common elements of the two overlapping early-early and late-early promoters. Our results, which confirm that the early-early promoter is stronger than the late-early one, also support our previous suggestion that they are in competition for the transcriptional machinery. The general organization of the SV40 early promoter region is discussed.;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
3402;32321754;Maternal T Cells in the Human Placental Villi Support an Allograft Response during Noninfectious Villitis.;"During human pregnancy, proinflammatory responses in the placenta can cause severe fetal complications, including growth restriction, preterm birth, and stillbirth. Villitis of unknown etiology (VUE), an inflammatory condition characterized by the infiltration of maternal CD8+ T cells into the placenta, is hypothesized to be secondary to either a tissue rejection response to the haploidentical fetus or from an undiagnosed infection. In this study, we characterized the global TCR β-chain profile in human T cells isolated from placentae diagnosed with VUE compared with control and infectious villitis-placentae by immunoSEQ. Immunosequencing demonstrated that VUE is driven predominantly by maternal T cell infiltration, which is significantly different from controls and infectious cases; however, these T cell clones show very little overlap between subjects. Mapping TCR clones to common viral epitopes (CMV, EBV, and influenza A) demonstrated that Ag specificity in VUE was equal to controls and significantly lower than CMV-specific clones in infectious villitis. Our data indicate VUE represents an allograft response, not an undetected infection. These observations support the development of screening methods to predict those at risk for VUE and the use of specific immunomodulatory therapies during gestation to improve outcomes in affected fetuses.";-;-;-;hard_0
3404;21734151;Mutation of the conserved polyadenosine RNA binding protein, ZC3H14/dNab2, impairs neural function in Drosophila and humans.;Here we report a human intellectual disability disease locus on chromosome 14q31.3 corresponding to mutation of the ZC3H14 gene that encodes a conserved polyadenosine RNA binding protein. We identify ZC3H14 mRNA transcripts in the human central nervous system, and we find that rodent ZC3H14 protein is expressed in hippocampal neurons and colocalizes with poly(A) RNA in neuronal cell bodies. A Drosophila melanogaster model of this disease created by mutation of the gene encoding the ZC3H14 ortholog dNab2, which also binds polyadenosine RNA, reveals that dNab2 is essential for development and required in neurons for normal locomotion and flight. Biochemical and genetic data indicate that dNab2 restricts bulk poly(A) tail length in vivo, suggesting that this function may underlie its role in development and disease. These studies reveal a conserved requirement for ZC3H14/dNab2 in the metazoan nervous system and identify a poly(A) RNA binding protein associated with a human brain disorder. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

3406;32289446;Characterisation of the biochemical and cellular roles of native and pathogenic amelogenesis imperfecta mutants of FAM83H.;The majority of mutations identified in patients with amelogenesis imperfecta have been mapped to FAM83H. As FAM83H expression is not limited to the enamel, how FAM83H contributes to amelogenesis is still largely unknown. We previously reported that members of the FAM83 family of proteins interact with and regulate the subcellular distribution of the promiscuous serine-threonine protein kinase CK1 family, through their shared N-terminal DUF1669 domains. FAM83H co-localises with CK1 isoforms to speckle-like structures in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. In this report, we show FAM83H, unlike other FAM83 proteins, interacts and colocalises with NCK1/2 tyrosine kinase adaptor proteins. This interaction is mediated by proline-rich motifs within the C-terminus of FAM83H, specifically interacting with the second and third SH3 domains of NCK1/2. Moreover, FAM83H pathogenic AI mutant proteins, which trigger C-terminal truncations of FAM83H, retain their interactions with CK1 isoforms but lose interaction with NCK1/2. These AI mutant FAM83H proteins acquire a nuclear localisation, and recruit CK1 isoforms to the nucleus where CK1 retains its kinase activity. As understanding the constituents of the FAM83H-localised speckles may hold the key to unravelling potential substrates of FAM83H-associated CK1 substrates, we employed a TurboID-based proximity labelling approach and uncovered several proteins including Iporin and BAG3 as potential constituents of the speckles.;polyproline;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
3408;23690950;Intrinsic and extrinsic connections of Tet3 dioxygenase with CXXC zinc finger modules.;Tet proteins are emerging as major epigenetic modulators of cell fate and plasticity. However, little is known about how Tet proteins are targeted to selected genomic loci in distinct biological contexts. Previously, a CXXC-type zinc finger domain in Tet1 was shown to bind CpG-rich DNA sequences. Interestingly, in human and mouse the Tet2 and Tet3 genes are adjacent to Cxxc4 and Cxxc10-1, respectively. The CXXC domains encoded by these loci, together with those in Tet1 and Cxxc5, identify a distinct homology group within the CXXC domain family. Here we provide evidence for alternative mouse Tet3 transcripts including the Cxxc10-1 sequence (Tet3(CXXC)) and for an interaction between Tet3 and Cxxc4. In vitro Cxxc4 and the isolated CXXC domains of Tet1 and Tet3(CXXC) bind DNA substrates with similar preference towards the modification state of cytosine at a single CpG site. In vivo Tet1 and Tet3 isoforms with and without CXXC domain hydroxylate genomic 5-methylcytosine with similar activity. Relative transcript levels suggest that distinct ratios of Tet3(CXXC) isoforms and Tet3-Cxxc4 complex may be present in adult tissues. Our data suggest that variable association with CXXC modules may contribute to context specific functions of Tet proteins. ;polyglycine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
3410;1723930;A cytochemical and immunocytochemical study of DNA distribution in spermatid nuclei of mouse, rabbit, and bull.;DNA distribution in mouse, rabbit and bull spermatids was analyzed by electron microscopy, after using a Feulgen-like HCl-osmium ammine procedure, and after immunocytochemistry with anti-DNA antibodies. In addition, nucleic acids were visualized with the intercalating dye ethidium bromide and phosphotungstic acid. The parts of DNA displaying a beta helix configuration (possibly A-T rich parts) were identified by epifluorescence microscopy after staining with Hoechst 33258. In all 3 species, young spermatid nuclei were seen to have large areas poor in DNA, as well as DNA-rich areas, which were mostly concentrated into a peripheral layer close to the acrosome and into one or several masses, displaying species-specific locations. These DNA-rich areas were stained with Hoechst 33258. Elongating spermatid nucleic contained homogeneously distributed DNA, and this was evident following both immunocytochemistry and nucleic acid histochemistry in all 3 species. However, the distribution appeared more heterogeneous after the Feulgen-like procedure, and was accompanied by a disappearance of Hoechst-fluorescence. In fully elongated spermatids, all nuclear areas stained with Hoechst 33258, while the 3 other techniques labeled either all or species-specific parts of the condensed chromatin. The reasons for these variable reactions are discussed in terms of technique specificities, DNA configuration and nucleoprotein moiety replacements. ;polyalanine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
3412;6368056;Medical management of pituitary disease.;Success in the treatment of pituitary tumours depends on their size and invasiveness so that early detection is imperative. Immediate cure of microadenomas is assured by trans-sphenoidal microsurgery although longterm results are not yet established. Complete removal of large tumours is less likely and radiotherapy is advised if there is evidence of residual tumour activity. External irradiation is indicated in the treatment of radiosensitive germinomas. Drugs can control symptoms before surgery or while awaiting the effects of radiotherapy but may be the treatment of choice for large prolactinomas. Bromocriptine or other dopamine agonists not only inhibit prolactin secretion but also limit tumour size, but it is not known if they are effective indefinitely.

3415;34402752;Deciphering the structural and functional impact of missense mutations in Egr1-DNA interacting interface: an integrative computational approach.;Early growth response-1 (Egr1) is a zinc-finger transcription factor that plays a critical role in controlling cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. Egr1 is induced by many growth factors, cytokines, and stress signals and is also known to be involved in several pathological conditions like cancer, neurological and ocular disorders. The DNA binding domain of Egr1 is a highly conserved Cys2His2 (C2H2) zinc finger (ZNF) domain which specifically binds to GC-rich consensus sequence GcG (G/T) GGGCG and activates transcription. As the C2H2 domain specifically recognizes its DNA target, the mutations spanning this region shall perturb DNA recognition and may hinder transcription of target genes. Therefore, in this study, the missense mutations occurring specifically at the DNA binding domain (DBD) of Egr1 were probed by computational approaches involving in silico screening of pathogenic and functional mutants coupled with extensive molecular dynamics simulations, to determine the mutants that affect its structural stability and interactions with DNA. From the pathogenicity analysis of 38 missense mutations spanning Egr1-DBD, 17 were predicted as pathogenic, and 7 amongst these were found to have functional impact on Egr1. On combined analysis of molecular dynamics simulation, Residue interaction analysis and Egr1-DNA interaction analysis results, the mutants R371C and R375C showed least impact, whilst, H382R tend to increase the structural stability, whereas R360H, H390R, E393V, and H414Y conferred greater impact by altering the structural stability and DNA interactions. Hence, this study exposes the prospects of considering these 4 deleterious mutations for clinical significance, but needs further experimental validation.HighlightsEgr1's DNA binding domain is a highly conserved Cys2His2 (C2H2) zinc finger domain that specifically recognizes its DNA target.Mutations spanning in the DNA binding domain shall perturb DNA recognition and may hinder transcription.Among the missense mutations, mutants R360H, H390R, E393V, and H414Y were inferred to have a greater impact on Egr1 by altering the structural stability and DNA interactions.;polycysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
3418;9328441;Kinetics of wound-induced v-Ha-ras transgene expression and papilloma development in transgenic Tg.AC mice.;The Tg.AC transgenic mouse, which harbors an activated v-Ha-ras coding region that is fused to an embryonic zeta globin transcriptional control region and a 3' simian virus 40 polyadenylation sequence, rapidly develops epidermal papillomas in response to topical application of chemical carcinogens or tumor promoters or to full-thickness wounding of the dorsal skin. In this report, we investigated the localization and temporal induction of v-Ha-ras transgene expression after full-thickness wounding of Tg.AC mouse skin. Surgically inflicted full-thickness incisions 3 cm long yielded four to six papillomas per Tg.AC mouse by 5 wk after wounding. Similar wounding of the FVB/N isogenic host strain did not produce tumors, which implicates a causal role for the v-Ha-ras transgene. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays detected the v-Ha-ras transgene transcript in total RNA samples isolated from wound-associated tissue 3 and 4 wk after wounding. Tissues 1-2 wk after wounding and all non-wound-associated tissues were negative for transgene expression. In situ hybridization experiments using transgene-specific 35S-labeled antisense RNA probes localized transgene expression to the basal epidermal cells in wound-induced papillomas. Adjacent normal and hyperplastic skin tissues were negative for transgene expression by this assay. This work supports the hypothesis that the wound repair response leads to the transcriptional activation and continued expression of the v-Ha-ras transgene in specific cells in the skin, which alters normal epithelial differentiation and ultimately results in neoplastic growth.;-;-;-;hard_0
3420;19493348;The evolution of nuclear auxin signalling.;The plant hormone auxin directs many aspects of plant growth and development. To understand the evolution of auxin signalling, we compared the genes encoding two families of crucial transcriptional regulators, AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) and AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID (Aux/IAA), among flowering plants and two non-seed plants, Physcomitrella patens and Selaginella moellendorffii. Comparative analysis of the P. patens, S. moellendorffii and Arabidopsis thaliana genomes suggests that the well-established rapid transcriptional response to auxin of flowering plants, evolved in vascular plants after their divergence from the last common ancestor shared with mosses. An N-terminally truncated ARF transcriptional activator is encoded by the genomes of P. patens and S. moellendorffii, and suggests a supplementary mechanism of nuclear auxin signalling, absent in flowering plants. Site-specific analyses of positive Darwinian selection revealed relatively high rates of synonymous substitution in the A. thaliana ARFs of classes IIa (and their closest orthologous genes in poplar) and Ib, suggesting that neofunctionalization in important functional regions has driven the evolution of auxin signalling in flowering plants. Primary auxin responsive gene families (GH3, SAUR, LBD) show different phylogenetic profiles in P. patens, S. moellendorffii and flowering plants, highlighting genes for further study. The genome of P. patens encodes all of the basic components necessary for a rapid auxin response. The spatial separation of the Q-rich activator domain and DNA-binding domain suggests an alternative mechanism of transcriptional control in P. patens distinct from the mechanism seen in flowering plants. Significantly, the genome of S. moellendorffii is predicted to encode proteins suitable for both methods of regulation. ;polyglutamine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

According to the model proposed, the cooperative interactions among classical nuclear matrix proteins which are abundant (topoisomerase II, histone H1, HMG-I(Y), lamins A, B1, SAF-A, ARBP and others) bring together distant AT-rich classical MAR sequences causing looping of DNA. This process juxtaposes enhancers, ORIs, promoters, and other control elements that cohabit with MARs loaded with the less abundant transcription factors (TFs) facilitating productive interactions between enhancers and promoters or enhancers and core ORIs.

For the study, 61 boys and 69 girls, 6 to 11 years of age, volunteered. They were considered healthy according to routine clinical criteria. They were synchronized with diurnal activity from around 07:00 to 21:00 and nocturnal rest, time of year being taken into account. Tests were performed at school during 4 weeks of 4.5 days of school at fixed clock hours: 09:00, 11:00, 14:00, and 16:00. Gym time was randomized with regard to week order and season. Four different classes (39 boys and 38 girls) were involved in psychophysiological tests, and two different classes (22 boys and 31 girls) collected saliva samples for morning free cortisol determination. Both t-test and three-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used for statistical analyses. Better performances were obtained in June than in mid-winter with reference to letter cancellation and random number addition tests. As a group phenomenon, morning (09:00 to 10:00) versus afternoon (14:00 to 15:00) gym was not an influential condition with regard to sleep duration, oral temperature, self-rated fatigue and drowsiness, letter cancellation, addition tests, or salivary cortisol. However, gym-time-related differences were observed in classes of younger subjects (e.g., 6-7 years) with regard to self-rated fatigue and the letter cancellation test. Such variability among subgroups suggests that interindividual differences are likely to exist in younger children with regard to manipulation of environmental factors. In addition, gym itself (without gym time consideration) may be an influential factor with regard to diurnal patterns of some variables (e.g., the letter cancellation test).;-;-;-;hard_0
3438;9311557;Synthesis, DNA-binding and cytotoxic properties of a bis(netropsin)-anthracenedione conjugate.;A combilexin molecule containing two netropsin moieties attached to the aminoalkyl side chains of mitoxantrone has been synthesized and evaluated for cytotoxic activity towards murine L1210 leukaemia and human MCF7 carcinoma cells in vitro. It is marginally less cytotoxic than mitoxantrone but much more growth-inhibitory than netropsin. Various spectroscopic and biochemical techniques have been employed to characterize the interaction of the drug, NetMitox, with DNA. Circular dichroism (CD) and electric linear dichroism (ELD) data indicate that binding of the netropsin moiety or moieties within the minor groove of the double helix impedes the intercalation of the adjacent anthracenedione ring. ELD and footprinting experiments reveal a certain amount of mutual interference between the two functionalities of the conjugate molecule but the selective recognition of AT-rich sequences by netropsin largely dominates the recognition pattern. The lack of interaction with GC-rich sequences is attributable to steric hindrance occasioned by the 2-amino group of guanine which impedes access of the netropsin moiety into the minor groove, as is evident by the good binding of the hybrid to poly(dI-dC) x poly(dI-dC) as well as by the redistribution of its binding sites on DNA molecules substituted with inosine and/or 2,6-diaminopurine. The difficulty of the anthracenedione system in intercalating correlates with the lack of effect of the drug on cleavable complex formation with topoisomerase II as well as its diminished cytotoxicity compared to mitoxantrone. However, the finding that the drug retains significant toxicity towards leukaemia cells may suggest that DNA is perhaps not the unique molecular target.;polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

3442;20091781;NOD2 mediates inflammatory responses of primary murine glia to Streptococcus pneumoniae.;It is now widely accepted that resident central nervous system (CNS) cells such as microglia and astrocytes initiate and/or augment inflammation following trauma or infection. However, the mechanisms by which glial cells perceive microbial challenges are only now becoming apparent. We have recently demonstrated that microglia and astrocytes constitutively express nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-2 (NOD2), a member of the novel nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat region-containing family of proteins (NLR) that functions as an intracellular receptor for a minimal motif present in all bacterial peptidoglycans. Furthermore, we have shown that this NLR is essential for glial responses to gram-negative pathogens and in vivo CNS inflammation elicited by these organisms. In the present study, we have established that intact Streptococcus pneumoniae, the major causative agent for gram-positive bacterial meningitis in adults, is a potent stimulus for the activation of the pivotal inflammatory transcription factor NF-kB and production of inflammatory cytokines in primary murine microglia and astrocytes. We demonstrate that NOD2 is essential for the maximal responses of these cells to intact S. pneumoniae but not cellular lysates. Finally, we have shown that this cytosolic pattern recognition receptor is required for the elevated inflammatory mediator levels, astrogliosis, and demyelination, following in vivo administration of this gram-positive CNS pathogen. As such, we suggest that NOD2 plays a critical role in the establishment of the lethal inflammation associated with streptococcal meningitis. ;polyleucine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

3447;7978686;Management of major hepatic trauma involving interhospital transfer.;A recent 10-year experience with major liver trauma at the Maine Medical Center was reviewed in order to examine treatment options involving interhospital transfer in the management of major liver trauma in rural areas. Liver injuries of at least Grade III by the systems of Moore or Mirvis were included, except for patients admitted without vital signs. We found 98 cases of major hepatic trauma, of which 54 had been referred by 21 smaller hospitals. Of 15 patients received after laparotomy elsewhere, nine underwent reoperation for control of bleeding or removal of packs, and three died of associated injury or multiple organ failure (MOF). Of the other 39 transferred patients, 23 diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) were selected for nonoperative management with success, 11 survived after operation, one died of hemorrhage, and four died of associated injuries or MOF. For the entire group of 98 cases, adjuncts perceived as useful included perihepatic gauze packing (11 cases) and angiographic embolization (6 cases). Mortality increased with increasing magnitude of injury. Even with major hepatic trauma on CT, stable patients are unlikely to require surgery.

3449;9417107;Negative regulation of beta enolase gene transcription in embryonic muscle is dependent upon a zinc finger factor that binds to the G-rich box within the muscle-specific enhancer.;We have previously identified a muscle-specific enhancer within the first intron of the human beta enolase gene. Present in this enhancer are an A/T-rich box that binds MEF-2 protein(s) and a G-rich box (AGTGGGGGAGGGGGCTGCG) that interacts with ubiquitously expressed factors. Both elements are required for tissue-specific expression of the gene in skeletal muscle cells. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a Kruppel-like zinc finger protein, termed beta enolase repressor factor 1, that binds in a sequence-specific manner to the G-rich box and functions as a repressor of the beta enolase gene transcription in transient transfection assays. Using fusion polypeptides of beta enolase repressor factor 1 and the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain, we have identified an amino-terminal region responsible for the transcriptional repression activity, whereas a carboxyl-terminal region was shown to contain a potential transcriptional activation domain. The expression of this protein decreases in developing skeletal muscles, correlating with lack of binding activity in nuclear extract from adult skeletal tissue, in which novel binding activities have been detected. These results suggest that in addition to the identified factor, which functionally acts as a negative regulator and is enriched in embryonic muscle, the G-rich box binds other factors, presumably exerting a positive control on transcription. The interplay between factors that repress or activate transcription may constitute a developmentally regulated mechanism that modulates beta enolase gene expression in skeletal muscle.;polythreonine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
3451;27487467;The formation and characteristics of the i-motif structure within the promoter of the c-myb proto-oncogene.;C-myb proto-oncogene is a potential therapeutic target for some human solid tumors and leukemias. A long cytosine-rich sequence, which locates the downstream of the transcription initiation site, is demonstrated to fold into an intramolecular i-motif DNA using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Effects of factors, including the pH value, the number of C:C(+) dimers, the concentration of buffer, the molecular crowding condition, and the coexistence of the complementary DNA, on the formation and the structural stability of the i-motif DNA are systematically studied. We have demonstrated that the i-motif folding in the c-myb promoter could be accelerated upon synergistic physiological stimuli including intracellular molecular crowding and low pH values, as well as the large number of the i-motif C:C(+) dimers. Meanwhile, various inputs, such as acids/bases and metal ions, have exhibited their abilities in controlling the conformational switch of the c-myb GC-rich DNA. Acidic pH values and the presence of K(+) ions can induce the dissociation of the double helix. Our present strategy can greatly extend the potential usages of i-motif DNA molecules with specific sequences as conformational switch-controlled devices. Moreover, this work demonstrates the superiority of CD spectroscopy associated with ESI-MS as a rapid, more cost-effective and sensitive structural change responsive method in the research of DNA conformational switching.  ;polycysteine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
3459;10023076;Cloning and characterization of the promoters of the maxiK channel alpha and beta subunits.;Large conductance, calcium-activated potassium (maxiK) channels are expressed in nerve, muscle, and other cell types and are important determinants of smooth muscle tone. To determine the mechanisms involved in the transcriptional regulation of maxiK channels, we characterized the promoter regions of the pore forming (alpha) and regulatory (beta) subunits of the human channel complex. Maximum promoter activity (up to 12.3-fold over control) occurred between nucleotides -567 and -220 for the alpha subunit (hSlo) gene. The minimal promoter is GC-rich with 5 Sp-1 binding sites and several TCC repeats. Other transcription factor-binding motifs, including c/EBP, NF-kB, PU.1, PEA-3, Myo-D, and E2A, were observed in the 5'-flanking sequence. Additionally, a CCTCCC sequence, which increases the transcriptional activity of the SM1/2 gene in smooth muscle, is located 27 bp upstream of the TATA-like sequence, a location identical to that found in the SM1/2 5'-flanking region. However, the promoter directed equivalent expression when transfected into smooth muscle and other cell types. Analysis of the hSlo beta subunit 5'-flanking region revealed a TATA box at position -77 and maximum promoter activity (up to 11.0-fold) in a 200 bp region upstream from the cap site. Binding sites for GATA-1, Myo-D, c-myb, Ets-1/Elk-1, Ap-1, and Ik-2 were identified within this sequence. Two CCTCCC elements are present in the hSlo beta subunit promoter, but tissue-specific transcriptional activity was not observed. The lack of tissue-specific promoter activity, particularly the finding of promoter activity in cells from tissues in which the maxiK gene is not expressed, suggests a complex channel regulatory mechanism for hSlo genes. Moreover, the lack of similarity of the promoters of the two genes suggests that regulation of coordinate expression of the subunits does not occur through equivalent cis-acting sequences. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

The buoyancy was attributed to air and oil entrapped in the agar gel network. A floating controlled-release 300-mg theophylline tablet having a density of 0.67 was prepared and compared in vitro and in vivo to Theo-dur. The in vitro release rate of the floating tablet was slower. In vivo scintigraphic studies for a floating and a heavy nonfloating tablet, under fasting and nonfasting conditions, showed that the presence of food significantly increased the gastric retention time for both tablets, and tablet density did not appear to make a difference in the gastric retention time. However, the positions of the floating and nonfloating tablets in the stomach were very different. Bioavailability studies in human volunteers under both fasting and nonfasting conditions showed results comparable to those with Theo-dur. The floating controlled-release theophylline tablet maintained constant theophylline levels of about 2 mg/mL for 24 hr, which may be attributable to the release from the agar gel matrix and the buoyancy of the tablet in the stomach.;-;-;-;hard_0
3466;30622337;Release of transcriptional repression via ErbB2-induced, SUMO-directed phosphorylation of myeloid zinc finger-1 serine 27 activates lysosome redistribution and invasion.;HER2/ErbB2 activation turns on transcriptional processes that induce local invasion and lead to systemic metastasis. The early transcriptional changes needed for ErbB2-induced invasion are poorly understood. Here, we link ErbB2 activation to invasion via ErbB2-induced, SUMO-directed phosphorylation of a single serine residue, S27, of the transcription factor myeloid zinc finger-1 (MZF1). Utilizing an antibody against MZF1-pS27, we show that the phosphorylation of S27 correlates significantly (p < 0.0001) with high-level expression of ErbB2 in primary invasive breast tumors. Phosphorylation of MZF1-S27 is an early response to ErbB2 activation and results in increased transcriptional activity of MZF1. It is needed for the ErbB2-induced expression of MZF1 target genes CTSB and PRKCA, and invasion of single-cells from ErbB2-expressing breast cancer spheroids. The phosphorylation of MZF1-S27 is preceded by poly-SUMOylation of K23, which can make S27 accessible to efficient phosphorylation by PAK4. Based on our results, we suggest for an activation mechanism where phosphorylation of MZF1-S27 triggers MZF1 dissociation from its transcriptional repressors such as the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF). Our findings increase understanding of the regulation of invasive signaling in breast cancer by uncovering a detailed biological mechanism of how ErbB2 activation can rapidly lead to its invasion-promoting target gene expression and invasion. ;polyserine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function

Twenty-five pairs of TC and adjacent tissues were collected after surgical resection. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression of miR-205 in TC tissues and cells (SW579, B-CPAP, TPC-1, WRO). SW579 cells were transfected with miR-205 mimic, and SW579 cells with overexpression of miR-205 were constructed. The effects of miR-205 overexpression on the proliferation and migration of SW579 cells were observed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and Transwell assays, respectively. Luciferase reporter assay was further used to look for the target of miR-205 and to study the mechanism of miR-205 in the proliferation and migration of TC cells. Compared with normal tissues and cells, the expression of miR-205 was significantly reduced in TC tissues (t=3.47, P=0.031) and cells (t=5.41, P=0.016). Overexpression of miR-205 inhibited the proliferation (t=4.12, P=0.035) and migration (t=4.47, P=0.027) of SW579 cells. Luciferase reporter assays found that CCNB2 was a target gene of miR-205 (t=4.63, P=0.024), qRT-PCR and western blot assays confirmed there was negatively correlation between CCNB2 and miR-205 (t=3.55, P=0.029; t=2.86, P=0.043). CCNB2 overexpression reversed the inhibition of miR-205 on the proliferation (t=3.70, P=0.031) and migration (t=4.12, P=0.022) of SW579 cells. In conclusion, miR-205 inhibits the proliferation and migration of TC cells by targeting CCNB2, which may be a potential target of TC therapy.";-;-;-;hard_0
3472;8777196;Patterns of ICD-9 diagnoses among adolescents using school-based clinics: diagnostic categories by school level and gender.;"PURPOSE
Understanding utilization patterns in school clinics is important in discerning potential health outcomes among adolescents. This study reports on high-middle school and gender differences in ICD-9 diagnostic codes for students using Baltimore school clinics in the academic year 1989-90.


METHODS
12,953 visits resulted in 17,241 individual diagnoses. Data were grouped into 17 major diagnostic categories, subcategories for reproductive health and mental health, and 20 sentinel diagnoses.


RESULTS
Reproductive health diagnoses were most common for high school clinics (28% of all diagnoses). Mental health (psychosocial) diagnoses were most common for middle school clinics (30%). Adolescent women were much more likely to use clinics for reproductive health care needs than adolescent men. Adolescent men and women used the clinics with equal frequency for mental health, although specific diagnoses varied considerably by gender.


CONCLUSIONS
This overview of diagnostic patterns among adolescents using Baltimore's school-based clinics provides a unique view of differences in health care needs between younger and older teens and between male and female teens. These data have meaningful implications for clinic staffing and enhanced outreach efforts.";-;-;-;hard_0
3473;33338213;Cruciferous vegetables: rationale for exploring potential salutary effects of sulforaphane-rich foods in patients with chronic kidney disease.;Sulforaphane (SFN) is a sulfur-containing isothiocyanate found in cruciferous vegetables (Brassicaceae) and a well-known activator of nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), considered a master regulator of cellular antioxidant responses. Patients with chronic diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) present with high levels of oxidative stress and a massive inflammatory burden associated with diminished Nrf2 and elevated nuclear transcription factor-κB-κB expression. Because it is a common constituent of dietary vegetables, the salutogenic properties of sulforaphane, especially it's antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, have been explored as a nutritional intervention in a range of diseases of ageing, though data on CKD remain scarce. In this brief review, the effects of SFN as a senotherapeutic agent are described and a rationale is provided for studies that aim to explore the potential benefits of SFN-rich foods in patients with CKD.;polyasparagine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

3486;23675571;Organization and Evolution of Drosophila Terminin: Similarities and Differences between Drosophila and Human Telomeres.;"Drosophila lacks telomerase and fly telomeres are elongated by occasional transposition of three specialized retroelements. Drosophila telomeres do not terminate with GC-rich repeats and are assembled independently of the sequence of chromosome ends. Recent work has shown that Drosophila telomeres are capped by the terminin complex, which includes the fast-evolving proteins HOAP, HipHop, Moi, and Ver. These proteins, which are not conserved outside Drosophilidae and closely related Diptera, localize and function exclusively at telomeres, protecting them from fusion events. Other proteins required to prevent end-to-end fusion in flies include HP1, Eff/UbcD1, ATM, the components of the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs (MRN) complex, and the Woc transcription factor. These proteins do not share the terminin properties; they are evolutionarily conserved non-fast-evolving proteins that do not accumulate only at telomeres and do not serve telomere-specific functions. We propose that following telomerase loss, Drosophila rapidly evolved terminin to bind chromosome ends in a sequence-independent manner. This hypothesis suggests that terminin is the functional analog of the shelterin complex that protects human telomeres. The non-terminin proteins are instead likely to correspond to ancestral telomere-associated proteins that did not evolve as rapidly as terminin because of the functional constraints imposed by their involvement in diverse cellular processes. Thus, it appears that the main difference between Drosophila and human telomeres is in the protective complexes that specifically associate with the DNA termini. We believe that Drosophila telomeres offer excellent opportunities for investigations on human telomere biology. The identification of additional Drosophila genes encoding non-terminin proteins involved in telomere protection might lead to the discovery of novel components of human telomeres.

3488;9187663;Identification of de novo deletions at the NF1 gene: no preferential paternal origin and phenotypic analysis of patients.;Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant disorder. To date, a relatively small number of NF1 mutations have been characterized, thus precluding genotype-phenotype correlations. By genotyping 75 NF1 families, we have detected six hemizygous patients (two of whom are members of the same family). The five presumed deletions were confirmed by two quantitative methods of analysis of NF1 copy number: Southern hybridization with cDNA probes and a single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis that discriminates between the NF1 gene and the pseudogene sequences. The five deletions remove most of the NF1 gene, at least 225 kb, from exon 9 to the 3' end of the coding sequence. The origin of de novo mutations in the NF1 gene has been reported to be mainly paternal but we have determined that four of the de novo deletions involved the maternal chromosome and one the paternal chromosome. The six patients with deletions exhibited precocious, multiple clinical features of the disease. The incidence of tumor complications, particularly plexiform neurofibromas and intracranial tumors, among this group of patients is higher than the observed incidence in our NF1 population, suggesting that NF1 haploinsufficiency may cause a more severe phenotype with regard to tumor development. In contrast to other reports that associated large deletions with mildly dysmorphic facies, mental retardation and a large number of cutaneous neurofibromas, only one out of our six patients presented this phenotype.;-;-;-;hard_0

3494;2072894;Chromosome structure: DNA nucleotide sequence elements of a subset of the minichromosomes of the protozoan Trypanosoma brucei.;The genome of the protozoan Trypanosoma brucei contains a set of about 100 minichromosomes of about 50 to 150 kb in size. The small size of these chromosomes, their involvement in antigenic variation, and their mitotic stability make them ideal candidates for a structural analysis of protozoan chromosomes and their telomeres. We show that a subset of the minichromosomes is composed predominantly of simple-sequence DNA, with over 90% of the length of the minichromosome consisting of a tandem array of 177-bp repeats, indicating that these molecules have limited protein-coding capacity. Proceeding from the tip of the telomere to a chromosome internal position, a subset of the minichromosomes contained the GGGTTA telomere repeat, a 29-bp telomere-derived repeat, a region containing 74-bp G + C-rich direct repeats separated by approximately 155 bp of A + T-rich DNA that has a bent character, and 50 to 150 kb of the 177-bp repeat. Several of the minichromosome-derived telomeres did not encode protein-coding genes, indicating that the repertoire of telomeric variant cell surface glycoprotein genes is restricted to some telomeres only. The telomere organization in trypanosomes shares striking similarities to the organization of telomeres and subtelomeres in humans, yeasts, and plasmodia. An electron microscopic analysis of the minichromosomes showed that they are linear molecules without abnormal structures in the main body of the chromosome. The structure of replicating molecules indicated that minichromosomes probably have a single bidirectional origin of replication located in the body of the chromosome. We propose a model for the structure of the trypanosome minichromosomes.;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
3495;10091661;A survey of left-handed polyproline II helices.;"Left-handed polyproline II helices (PPII) are contiguous elements of protein secondary structure in which the phi and psi angles of constituent residues are restricted to around -75 degrees and 145 degrees, respectively. They are important in structural proteins, in unfolded states and as ligands for signaling proteins. Here, we present a survey of 274 nonhomologous polypeptide chains from proteins of known structure for regions that form these structures. Such regions are rare, but the majority of proteins contain at least one PPII helix. Most PPII helices are shorter than five residues, although the longest found contained 12 amino acids. Proline predominates in PPII, but Gln and positively charged residues are also favored. The basis of Gln's prevalence is its ability to form an i, i + 1 side-chain to main-chain hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of the proceeding residue; this helps to fix the psi angle of the Gln and the phi and psi of the proceeding residue in PPII conformations and explains why Gln is favored at the first position in a PPII helix. PPII helices are highly solvent exposed, which explains why apolar amino acids are disfavored despite preferring this region of phi/psi space when in isolation. PPII helices have perfect threefold rotational symmetry and within these structures we find significant correlation between the hydrophobicity of residues at i and i + 3; thus, PPII helices in globular proteins can be considered to be amphipathic.

The N-glycan structures were defined by a combination of compositional analysis, methylation analysis, selective chemical degradation (i.e. mild methanolysis, periodate-Smith degradation, and hydrazinolysis-nitrous acid deamination), enzymatic (endo-beta-galactosidase, peptide:N-glycanase, and Newcastle disease virus sialidase) digestion, and instrumental analyses (one- and two-dimensional proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry) which revealed novel and unique features: (a) the presence of highly branched poly-N-acetylactosamino pentaantennary structures; (b) the presence of a beta-galactosylated Lewis X antigenic epitope, Gal beta 1-->4 Gal beta 1-->4 (Fuc alpha 1-->3) GlcNAc beta 1-->; (c) the presence of a beta-galactosylated sialyl Lewis X structure, Gal beta 1-->4 (Neu5Ac alpha 2-->3) Gal beta 1-->4(Fuc alpha 1-->3) GlcNAc beta 1-->; (d) the presence of Gal beta 1-->4 Gal beta 1--> and Gal beta 1--> 4Gal beta 1-->4Gal beta 1--> as the major and minor groupings, respectively; and (e) the presence of the branched Gal residues, -->4GlcNAc beta 1-->3(Gal beta 1-->4) Gal beta 1-->.

Both catechin and glycyrrhizin could antagonize not only the increased micronucleated cells induced by arecoline and NaF but also the prolonged cell cycle induced by arecoline in CHO cells.

3501;8760879;TBP binds the transcriptionally inactive TA5 sequence but the resulting complex is not efficiently recognised by TFIIB and TFIIA.;The binding of TBP (TFIID) to the TATA box has been considered to direct promoter recognition and pre-initiation complex formation because it is the first event leading to basal transcription by RNA polymerase II. Here, we analyse the binding of yeast TBP to a consensus TATAAA box and two point mutations, TAAAAA (inactive) and TATATA (active). Despite the fact that the TAAAAA sequence does not support transcription in vitro, yeast TBP binds the three sequences showing, in this sense, only a limited sequence specificity. However, the TBP-TAAAAA complex cannot be recognised by other basal transcription factors, in particular by TFIIB. DNase I footprinting patterns of the TBP-TAAAAA complex are different from those observed in functional TBP-TATA box complexes, indicating that, most likely, it is a different spatial arrangement of the TBP-DNA complex that prevents formation of the TFIIB-TBP-TAAAAA complex, also seriously impairing entry of TFIIA to the complex. DNA deformability of the A/T-rich sequences appears to be an important determinant in the formation of a productive TBP-TATA complex. These results indicate that the transcriptional competence of A/T-rich sequences is determined not only by TBP binding, but also by the ability of other basal transcription factors to recognise the preformed TBP-DNA complexes. ;polythreonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

Analysis of entry in S phase of Swiss 3T3 cells reveals that daidzein blocked cell cycle G1 phase progression 4.6 h after stimulation by bombesin plus insulin. After removal of daidzein, insulin or insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) reinitiate cell cycle progression of daidzein-blocked cells without further addition of bombesin. The order in the mitogenic action of insulin or IGFs is as follows: IGF-1 (5 ng/ml) >> IGF-2 (0.5 microgram/ml) congruent to insulin (1 microgram/ml). Studies in vivo of protein kinase activation by mitogenic stimulation reveal that the treatment with daidzein decreased the activation of a MAP2 phosphorylating protein kinase (MAP2 kinase). In vitro kinase assays showed that daidzein inhibits casein kinase II activity, but does not inhibit MAP2 kinase activity. Activation of casein kinase II by polylysine augments the activity of MAP2 kinase in digitonin-permeabilized 3T3 cells.

3507;8196644;Mapping and mutagenesis of the amino-terminal transcriptional repression domain of the Drosophila Krüppel protein.;We previously demonstrated that the Drosophila Krüppel protein is a transcriptional repressor with separable DNA-binding and transcriptional repression activities. In this study, the minimal amino (N)-terminal repression region of the Krüppel protein was defined by transferring regions of the Krüppel protein to a heterologous DNA-binding protein, the lacI protein. Fusion of a predicted alpha-helical region from amino acids 62 to 92 in the N terminus of the Krüppel protein was sufficient to transfer repression activity. This putative alpha-helix has several hydrophobic surfaces, as well as a glutamine-rich surface. Mutants containing multiple amino acid substitutions of the glutamine residues demonstrated that this putative alpha-helical region is essential for repression activity of a Krüppel protein containing the entire N-terminal and DNA-binding regions. Furthermore, one point mutant with only a single glutamine on this surface altered to lysine abolished the ability of the Krüppel protein to repress, indicating the importance of the amino acid at residue 86 for repression. The N terminus also contained an adjacent activation region localized between amino acids 86 and 117. Finally, in accordance with predictions from primary amino acid sequence similarity, a repression region from the Drosophila even-skipped protein, which was six times more potent than that of the Krüppel protein in the mammalian cells, was characterized.

Two emergency hospitals, Sweden


PATIENTS
676 of the 687 patients aged 60 years or over admitted to the two emergency hospitals serving Gothenburg, Sweden during 1989-1993 who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria and whose case notes were available for study.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Seven year survival rates and odds ratios for risk factors based on multiple logistic regression analyses.


RESULTS
37 patients died and the timing was evenly distributed within the first 30 days of admission with a cumulated case-fatality rate of 5.5% at day 30. Mortality was increased among the patients compared with the control group during the subsequent years. Factors that influenced day 30 mortality were age and Forrest class.


CONCLUSION
Mortality is increased among patients with peptic ulcer bleeding even long after the event. Old age and signs of recent haemorrhage increase the risk.";-;-;-;hard_0
3516;8541316;Molecular cloning of glycoprotein antigens MGP57/53 recognized by monoclonal antibodies raised against bovine milk fat globule membrane.;A cDNA encoding 57 kDa and 53 kDa antigens (MGP57/53) recognized by monoclonal antibodies raised against bovine milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) (Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1199 (1994) 87-95) was cloned from lactating bovine mammary gland by a combination of reverse transcriptase-coupled polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 3'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3'-RACE). The deduced amino-acid sequence showed that mature MGP57/53 consists of 409 amino-acid residues and the calculated molecular weight and isoelectric point are 45,544 and 6.42, respectively. Computer analysis reveals that it has a significant similarity to mouse mammary epithelial cell surface protein, MFG-E8 and a human breast tumor-associated glycoprotein antigen, BA46-1. An N-terminal cysteine-rich domain and a C-terminal tandemly repeated sequence were highly conserved among them, but bovine MGP57/53 lacks 36 amino-acid residues containing a cluster of 5 prolines found in mouse MFG-E8. Northern blot analysis showed that the cDNA hybridized to about 2.0 kb mRNA of lactating bovine mammary gland. These results strongly support our previous report that the two MFGM antigens originate from a single gene and are isoforms with different N-linked sugar chains.;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
3519;23159346;Incorporation of polyinosine-polycytidylic acid enhances cytotoxic T cell activity and antitumor effects by octaarginine-modified liposomes encapsulating antigen, but not by octaarginine-modified antigen complex.;In a previous study, we reported on the efficient delivery of an antigen to the cytosol and a specific-antigen presentation on MHC class I in dendritic cells by rationally controlling the intracellular trafficking of ovalbumin (OVA), a model antigen, with stearylated octaarginine-modified liposomes (R8-Lip/OVA). However, no significant difference in antitumor effects against E.G7-OVA, OVA expressed lymphoma, was observed between R8-Lip/OVA and an electrostatic complex of R8 and OVA (R8/OVA-Com). In this study, we hypothesized that use of adjuvants clarified the difference in immune responses between R8-Lip/OVA and R8/OVA-Com, and selected polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) as an adjuvant. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity of the polyI:C and OVA encapsulated R8-Lip (R8-Lip/PIC/OVA) was drastically enhanced compared to R8-Lip/OVA and complete Freund's adjuvant with OVA. Moreover, the incorporation of polyI:C clearly was critical for the difference in antitumor effects and CTL activities between R8-Lip/OVA and R8/OVA-Com. These findings suggest that the carriers that are incorporated polyI:C has a great influence on the induction of cellular immunity in vivo. ;polyisoleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
3522;9598321;The human TRIP6 gene encodes a LIM domain protein and maps to chromosome 7q22, a region associated with tumorigenesis.;The thyroid receptor interacting protein-6 (TRIP6) was first identified as a ligand-dependent binding partner for the thyroid hormone receptor in a yeast two-hybrid screen. A partial TRIP6 cDNA clone that was isolated in the initial screen encodes two copies of the LIM domain. The LIM domain is a double zinc-finger structure that mediates protein-protein interactions. Here we report the complete amino acid sequence of human TRIP6. The TRIP6 protein displays a proline-rich N-terminal region linked to three tandemly arrayed C-terminal LIM domains. The global molecular architecture and sequence of TRIP6 place it in the same family as the adhesion plaque protein, zyxin, and the lipoma preferred partner (LPP). Zyxin and LPP are implicated in cellular signaling and tumorigenesis, respectively. By radiation hybrid mapping, the human TRIP6 gene was assigned to a segment of chromosome 7q22 that is commonly deleted in malignant myeloid diseases and uterine leiomyoma.;polyproline;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
3525;11592053;Peptide/benzodiazepine hybrids as ligands of CCK(A) and CCK(B) receptors.;The (neuro)hormones gastrin and cholecystokinin (CCK) share a common C-terminal tetrapeptide amide sequence that has been recognized as the message portion while the N-terminal extensions are responsible for the CCK(A) and CCK(B) receptor subtype selectivity and avidity. 1,4-Benzodiazepine derivatives are potent and selective antagonists of these receptors, and according to comparative molecular field analysis, the structures of these nonpeptidic compounds could well mimic the message sequence of the peptide agonists at least in terms of spatial array of the aromatic residues. Docking of a larger series of low molecular weight nonpeptide antagonists to a homology modeling derived CCK(B) receptor structure revealed a consensus binding mode that is further validated by data from site-directed mutagenesis studies of the receptors. Whether this putative binding pocket of the nonpeptide antagonists is identical to that of the message portion of the peptide agonists, or whether it is distinct and spatially separated, or overlapping, but with distinct interaction sites, is still object of debate. Using a 1,4-benzodiazepine core amino-functionalized at the C3 position, related tryptophanyl derivatives were synthesized as mimics of the tetrapeptide and subsequently extended N-terminally with gastrin and CCK address sequences. All hybrid constructs were recognized as antagonists by the CCK(A) and CCK(B) receptors, but their address portions were incapable of enhancing in significant manner selectivity and avidity. Consequently, the binding of the peptide/benzodiazepine hybrids has to be dictated mainly by the benzodiazepine moiety, which apparently prevents optimal interactions of the address peptides with extracellular receptor subdomains. These findings would strongly support the view of distinct binding sites for the message portion of the peptide agonists and the benzodiazepine-based nonpeptide antagonists.;-;-;-;hard_0
3528;35384211;Length-Dependent Collective Vibrational Dynamics in Alpha-Helices.;Functions of protein molecules in nature are closely associated with their well-defined three-dimensional structures and dynamics in body fluid. So far, many efforts have been made to reveal the relation of protein structure, dynamics, and function, but the structural origin of protein dynamics, especially for secondary structures as building blocks of conformation transition, is still ambiguous. Here we theoretically uncover the collective vibrations of elastic poly-alanine α-helices and find vibration patterns that are distinctively different over residue numbers ranging from 20 to 80. Contrary to the decreasing vibration magnitude from ends to the middle region for short helices, the vibration magnitude for long helices takes the minimum at approximately 1/5 of helix length from ends but reaches a peak at the center. Further analysis indicates that major vibrational modes of helical structures strongly depend on their lengths, where the twist mode dominates in the vibrations of short helices while the bend mode dominates the long ones analogous to an elastic Euler beam. The helix-coil transition pathway is also affected by the alternation of the first-order mode in helices with different lengths. The dynamic properties of the helical polypeptides are promising to be harnessed for de novo design of protein-based materials and artificial biomolecules in clinical treatments.;polyalanine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
3529;3053961;Solid-phase iodothyronine-5'-deiodinase (5'-D) assays applied in production of monoclonal antibodies against 5'-D.;Characterization of iodothyronine-deiodinating enzymes has been difficult due to loss of enzyme activity during purification. To obtain a new tool for studying these enzymes we investigated the possibility of developing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against iodothyronine-5'-deiodinase (5'-D). Two specific and sensitive solid-phase microassays were developed for screening hybridoma supernatants for the presence of antibodies inhibiting rat kidney 5'-D and antibodies binding to but not inhibiting the enzyme. BALB/c mice were immunized with a 3-((3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio)-1-propanesulphonate (CHAPS)-solubilized 5'-D-rich membrane preparation from rat kidney cortical tissue. Spleen cells were fused with NSI-Ag 4/l mouse myeloma cells by means of polyethylene glycol. Two hybridoma cell lines (AF5 and BE8) secreting MAbs specifically binding to without inhibiting 5'-D were produced. The AF5 antibody was of the IgG2a subclass and the BE8 antibody of the IgG2b subclass. Binding of one of the antibodies to the enzyme inhibited binding of the other in both an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a specific enzyme-binding assay. CHAPS-solubilized kidney microsomal fraction was chromatographed on a Sepharose 6B column. Elution profiles of 5'-D activity and MAb-binding antigens, as measured by ELISA with both AF5 and BE8, were identical. Monoclonal antibodies should be valuable probes in the further elucidation of the nature of the iodothyronine-deiodinating activity in various tissues.;polyaspartic;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
3531;8875926;Structure of the p53 tumor suppressor bound to the ankyrin and SH3 domains of 53BP2.;Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor are among the most frequently observed genetic alterations in human cancer and map to the 200-amino acid core domain of the protein. The core domain contains the sequence-specific DNA binding activity and the in vitro 53BP2 protein binding activity of p53. The crystal structure of the p53 core domain bound to the 53BP2 protein, which contains an SH3 (Src homology 3) domain and four ankyrin repeats, revealed that (i) the SH3 domain binds the L3 loop of p53 in a manner distinct from that of previously characterized SH3-polyproline peptide complexes, and (ii) an ankyrin repeat, which forms an L-shaped structure consisting of a beta hairpin and two alpha helices, binds the L2 loop of p53. The structure of the complex shows that the 53BP2 binding site on the p53 core domain consists of evolutionarily conserved regions that are frequently mutated in cancer and that it overlaps the site of DNA binding. The six most frequently observed p53 mutations disrupt 53BP2 binding in vitro. The structure provides evidence that the 53BP2-p53 complex forms in vivo and may have a critical role in the p53 pathway of tumor suppression.;polyproline;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

3534;20872248;Generation of antibody- and B cell-deficient pigs by targeted disruption of the J-region gene segment of the heavy chain locus.;A poly(A)-trap gene targeting strategy was used to disrupt the single functional heavy chain (HC) joining region (J(H)) of swine in primary fibroblasts. Genetically modified piglets were then generated via somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) and bred to yield litters comprising J(H) wild-type littermate (+/+), J(H) heterozygous knockout (±) and J(H) homozygous knockout (-/-) piglets in the expected Mendelian ratio of 1:2:1. There are only two other targeted loci previously published in swine, and this is the first successful poly(A)-trap strategy ever published in a livestock species. In either blood or secondary lymphoid tissues, flow cytometry, RT-PCR and ELISA detected no circulating IgM(+) B cells, and no transcription or secretion of immunoglobulin (Ig) isotypes, respectively in J(H) -/- pigs. Histochemical and immunohistochemical (IHC) studies failed to detect lymph node (LN) follicles or CD79α(+) B cells, respectively in J(H) -/- pigs. T cell receptor (TCR)(β) transcription and T cells were detected in J(H) -/- pigs. When reared conventionally, J(H) -/- pigs succumbed to bacterial infections after weaning. These antibody (Ab)- and B cell-deficient pigs have significant value as models for both veterinary and human research to discriminate cellular and humoral protective immunity to infectious agents. Thus, these pigs may aid in vaccine development for infectious agents such as the pandemic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and H1N1 swine flu. These pigs are also a first significant step towards generating a pig that expresses fully human, antigen-specific polyclonal Ab to target numerous incurable infectious diseases with high unmet clinical need. ;polyalanine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
3537;32646969;Global discovery of bacterial RNA-binding proteins by RNase-sensitive gradient profiles reports a new FinO domain protein.;RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in bacterial gene expression and physiology but their true number and functional scope remain little understood even in model microbes. To advance global RBP discovery in bacteria, we here establish glycerol gradient sedimentation with RNase treatment and mass spectrometry (GradR). Applied to Salmonella enterica, GradR confirms many known RBPs such as CsrA, Hfq, and ProQ by their RNase-sensitive sedimentation profiles, and discovers the FopA protein as a new member of the emerging family of FinO/ProQ-like RBPs. FopA, encoded on resistance plasmid pCol1B9, primarily targets a small RNA associated with plasmid replication. The target suite of FopA dramatically differs from the related global RBP ProQ, revealing context-dependent selective RNA recognition by FinO-domain RBPs. Numerous other unexpected RNase-induced changes in gradient profiles suggest that cellular RNA helps to organize macromolecular complexes in bacteria. By enabling poly(A)-independent generic RBP discovery, GradR provides an important element in the quest to build a comprehensive catalog of microbial RBPs.;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

3540;23300078;Identification of propofol binding sites in a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor with a photoreactive propofol analog.;"Propofol, a widely used intravenous general anesthetic, acts at anesthetic concentrations as a positive allosteric modulator of γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors and at higher concentration as an inhibitor of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Here, we characterize propofol binding sites in a muscle-type nAChR by use of a photoreactive analog of propofol, 2-isopropyl-5-[3-(trifluoromethyl)-3H-diazirin-3-yl]phenol (AziPm). Based upon radioligand binding assays, AziPm stabilized the Torpedo nAChR in the resting state, whereas propofol stabilized the desensitized state. nAChR-rich membranes were photolabeled with [(3)H]AziPm, and labeled amino acids were identified by Edman degradation. [(3)H]AziPm binds at three sites within the nAChR transmembrane domain: (i) an intrasubunit site in the δ subunit helix bundle, photolabeling in the nAChR desensitized state (+agonist) δM2-18' and two residues in δM1 (δPhe-232 and δCys-236); (ii) in the ion channel, photolabeling in the nAChR resting, closed channel state (-agonist) amino acids in the M2 helices (αM2-6', βM2-6' and -13', and δM2-13') that line the channel lumen (with photolabeling reduced by >90% in the desensitized state); and (iii) at the γ-α interface, photolabeling αM2-10'. Propofol enhanced [(3)H]AziPm photolabeling at αM2-10'. Propofol inhibited [(3)H]AziPm photolabeling within the δ subunit helix bundle at lower concentrations (IC50 = 40 μm) than it inhibited ion channel photolabeling (IC50 = 125 μm). These results identify for the first time a single intrasubunit propofol binding site in the nAChR transmembrane domain and suggest that this is the functionally relevant inhibitory binding site.

3541;9334319;Hrp1, a sequence-specific RNA-binding protein that shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, is required for mRNA 3'-end formation in yeast.;In yeast, four factors (CF I, CF II, PF I, and PAP) are required for accurate pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation in vitro. CF I can be separated further into CF IA and CF IB. Here we show that CF IB is the 73-kD Hrp1 protein. Recombinant Hrp1p made in Escherichia coli provides full CF IB function in both cleavage and poly(A) addition assays. Consistent with the presence of two RRM-type motifs, Hrp1p can be UV cross-linked to RNA, and this specific interaction requires the (UA)6 polyadenylation efficiency element. Furthermore, the CF II factor enhances the binding of Hrp1p to the RNA precursor. A temperature-sensitive mutant in HRP1 yields mRNAs with shorter poly(A) tails when grown at the nonpermissive temperature. Genetic analyses indicate that Hrp1p interacts with Rna15p and Rna14p, two components of CF 1A. The HRP1 gene was originally isolated as a suppressor of a temperature-sensitive npl3 allele, a gene encoding a protein involved in mRNA export. Like Npl3p, Hrp1p shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm, providing a potential link between 3'-end processing and mRNA export from the nucleus. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

3545;20690029;DkMyb2 wound-induced transcription factor of persimmon (Diospyros kaki Thunb.), contributes to proanthocyanidin regulation.;Proanthocyanidins (PAs) are secondary metabolites that contribute to the protection of a plant against biotic and abiotic stresses. Persimmon (Diospyros kaki) accumulates abundant PAs in each plant organ, and some potential Myb-like transcription factors (Myb-TFs) involved in the production of PAs have been isolated. In this study, we aimed to molecularly characterize one of them, DkMyb2, which was placed in a subclade including a PA regulator of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), TRANSPARENT TESTA2 (TT2), and was co-induced with PA pathway genes after wound stress. Ectopic DkMyb2 overexpression caused significant up-regulation of PA pathway genes in transgenic persimmon calluses and significant accumulation of PA, and increased mean degree of polymerization of PAs in transgenic kiwifruit calluses. Analysis of the DNA-binding ability of DkMyb2 by electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that DkMyb2 directly binds to the AC-rich cis-motifs known as AC elements in the promoters of the two PA pathway genes in persimmon, DkANR, and DkLAR. Furthermore, a transient reporter assay using a dual-luciferase system demonstrated direct transcriptional activation of DkANR and DkLAR by DkMyb2. We also discuss subfunctionalization of two PA regulators in persimmon, DkMyb2 and DkMyb4, as well as PA regulators in other plant species from the viewpoint of their ability to bind to cis-motifs and their functions in transcriptional activation. Our results provide insight into the multiple regulatory mechanisms that control PA metabolism by Myb-TFs in persimmon. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
3547;18328982;Sclerosing bone disorders.;"Sclerosing bone disorders are a diagnostic challenge. However, hereditary sclerosing disorders often have characteristic radiological features that allow their diagnosis. Osteocondensation can result from decreased bone resorption; malignant recessive osteopetroses have been related to mutations in several genes necessary for osteoclast function and also, more recently, to osteoclast differentiation (RANK-L). Albers-Schonberg disease or autosomal-dominant osteopetrosis type II has the characteristic 'sandwich vertebrae' and 'bone within bone' radiological features. It has been related to mutation in chloride channel 7, which is necessary for osteoclast acidification. Osteocondensation can also be related to increased bone formation. Camurati-Engelman dysplasia is a disabilitating disorder with leg pain and weakness, and thickening of the diaphysis of long bones on x ray. It is due to activating mutations in the gene encoding TGF-beta, a growth factor that increases bone formation. Other less common recessive or dominant sclerosing disorders, such as endosteal hyperostosis, sclerostosis, van Buchen disease and high bone mass syndrome, are due to mutations in two genes (LRP5 and SOST) of the Wnt pathway that induce increased osteoblast activity. Recent elucidation of the molecular mechanism responsible for several hereditary diseases with osteocondensation has improved our comprehension of bone remodelling. It has allowed the discovery of new targets for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, some of which are already being investigated in clinical trials. Molecular mechanism for some hereditary osteocondensation remains to be discovered.";-;-;-;hard_0
3548;2469767;The human mannose-binding protein functions as an opsonin.;The human mannose-binding protein (MBP) is a multimeric serum protein that is divided into three domains: a cysteine-rich NH2-terminal domain that stabilizes the alpha-helix of the second collagen-like domain, and a third COOH-terminal carbohydrate binding region. The function of MBP is unknown, although a role in host defense is suggested by its ability to bind yeast mannans. In this report we show that native and recombinant human MBP can serve in an opsonic role in serum and thereby enhance clearance of mannose rich pathogens by phagocytes. MBP binds to wild-type virulent Salmonella montevideo that express a mannose-rich O-polysaccharide. Interaction of MBP with these organisms results in attachment, uptake, and killing of the opsonized bacteria by phagocytes. These results demonstrate that MBP plays a role in first line host defense against certain pathogenic organisms. ;polycysteine;helix;-;LCR_with_function

3553;9928373;Helicobacter pylori infection and the pathogenesis of duodenal ulceration.;Helicobacter pylori is a gram-negative spiral bacterium confined to the habitat of gastric-type epithelium. H. pylori causes duodenal ulceration by a cumulative effect of antral predominant gastritis with increased acid secretion, consequent gastric metaplasia in the duodenum (a site of further colonization by H. pylori), duodenitis, reduced duodenal bicarbonate secretion, and mucosal damage. Bacterial factors influence outcome. Major determinants are the production of a vacuolating toxin and the presence of CagA, an immunodominant product of a nonconserved gene cagA, a marker for the cag pathogenicity island that encodes virulence genes involved in induction of epithelial chemokine responses. In ulcer patients the mucosal immune response is polarized to a T-helper-1 (Th1) cell-mediated response, which may contribute to mucosal damage. Eradication of H. pylori restores acid output to normal. Loss of both acid and bacteria halts gastroduodenitis and allows ulcer healing.

3555;14769017;Solution structure of the 30 kDa polysulfide-sulfur transferase homodimer from Wolinella succinogenes.;The periplasmic polysulfide-sulfur transferase (Sud) protein encoded by Wolinella succinogenes is involved in oxidative phosphorylation with polysulfide-sulfur as a terminal electron acceptor. The polysulfide-sulfur is covalently bound to the catalytic Cys residue of the Sud protein and transferred to the active site of the membranous polysulfide reductase. The solution structure of the homodimeric Sud protein has been determined using heteronuclear multidimensional NMR techniques. The structure is based on NOE-derived distance restraints, backbone hydrogen bonds, and torsion angle restraints as well as residual dipolar coupling restraints for a refinement of the relative orientation of the monomer units. The monomer structure consists of a five-stranded parallel beta-sheet enclosing a hydrophobic core, a two-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet, and six alpha-helices. The dimer fold is stabilized by hydrophobic residues and ion pairs found in the contact area between the two monomers. Similar to rhodanese enzymes, Sud catalyzes the transfer of the polysulfide-sulfur to the artificial acceptor cyanide. Despite their similar functions and active sites, the amino acid sequences and structures of these proteins are quite different.;-;-;-;hard_0

Associated problems include cost, disease transmission, and stem subsidence. Synthetic grafts are therefore appealing, and ideally display similar mechanical characteristics as allograft, but with enhanced ability to form de novo bone. High and low molecular weight forms of three different polymers [poly(DL-lactide) (P(DL) LA), poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (P(DL) LGA), and poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL)] were milled, impacted into discs, and then examined in a shear testing rig, in comparison to allograft. In addition, skeletal stem cells (SSCs) were combined with each of the milled polymers, followed by impaction and examination for cell viability and number, via fluorostaining and biochemical assays. The shear strengths of high/low mwt P(DL) LA, and high/low mwt P(DL) LGA were significantly higher than allograft (p < 0.01). High/low mwt PCL had significantly lower shear strengths (p < 0.01). WST-1 assay and fluorstaining indicated significantly increased cell viability on high mwt P(DL) LA and high mwt P(DL) LGA over allograft (p < 0.05).

3563;21878116;TDP-43 knockdown impairs neurite outgrowth dependent on its target histone deacetylase 6.;Trans-activation response element (TAR) DNA binding protein of 43kDa (TDP-43) is causally related to the neurodegenerative diseases frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis being the hallmark protein in the disease-characteristic neuropathological lesions and via genetic linkage. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is an established target of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43. HDAC6 is an unusual cytosolic deacetylase enzyme, central for a variety of pivotal cellular functions including aggregating protein turnover, microtubular dynamics and filopodia formation. All these functions are important in the context of neurodegenerative proteinopathies involving TDP-43. We have previously shown in a human embryonic kidney cell line that TDP-43 knockdown significantly impairs the removal of a toxic, aggregating polyQ ataxin-3 fusion protein in an HDAC6-dependent manner. Here we investigated the influence of TDP-43 and its target HDAC6 on neurite outgrowth. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells with stably silenced TDP-43 showed a significant reduction of neurite outgrowth induced by retinoic acid and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Re-transfection with TDP-43 as well as HDAC6 rescued retinoic acid-induced neurite outgrowth. In addition, we show that silencing of HDAC6 alone is sufficient to reduce neurite outgrowth of in vitro differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. TDP-43 deficiency leads to impairment of neurite growth in an HDAC6-dependent manner, thereby contributing to neurodegenerative events in TDP-43 diseases. ;polyglutamine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
3564;7890400;Deviation of immune response to Chlamydia psittaci outer membrane protein in lipopolysaccharide-hyporesponsive mice.;The outcome of infection is determined by both the quantity and the quality of an induced immune response. In particular, it has been demonstrated for selected pathogens that induction of TH1 or TH2 type helper T-cell subsets determines whether an immune response gives rise to protective immunity or disease-associated immunopathology. The nature of the antigen and the type of antigen-presenting cells recruited in the induction of a response are critical factors that influence the quality of the immune response. Of particular interest in this respect is the immune response to bacterial particles and the impact of cell wall-associated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on that response. Nonspecific activation of macrophages and B lymphocytes by LPS could skew the phenotype of activated antigen-presenting cells and selectively alter the immunoglobulin isotypes and helper T-cell subsets that are induced following infection. In an initial attempt to detect immune deviation associated with LPS stimulation, we have compared the immunoglobulin isotypes of antibodies specific for the cysteine-rich outer membrane protein Omp2 induced in normal and LPS-hyporesponsive mice following immunization with Chlamydia psittaci strain guinea pig inclusion conjunctivitis whole elementary bodies. We report that there is a dramatic shift of Omp2-specific antibody from predominantly immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a) isotype in LPS-hyporesponsive mice to high levels of IgG1 isotype in LPS-responder strains. The dependence of the IgG1 isotype shift on the LPS responder status is linked to the structure of the antigen and its natural processing pathway since LPS-hyporesponsive mice are not, in general, deficient in IgG1 antibody production. In particular, the antibody response to purified recombinant Omp2 is predominantly of the IgG1 isotype even in LPS-hyporesponsive mice. ;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
3566;32766128;RIG-1-Like Receptor Activation Synergizes With Intratumoral Alpha Radiation to Induce Pancreatic Tumor Rejection, Triple-Negative Breast Metastases Clearance, and Antitumor Immune Memory in Mice.;Diffusing alpha-emitting radiation therapy (DaRT) employs intratumoral Ra-224-coated seeds that efficiently destroy solid tumors by slowly releasing alpha-emitting atoms inside the tumor. In immunogenic tumor models, DaRT was shown to activate systemic antitumor immunity. Agonists of the membrane-bound toll-like receptors (TLRs) enhanced these effects and led to tumor rejection. Here, we examined the combination of DaRT with agents that activate a different type of pattern recognition receptors, the cytoplasmatic RIG1-like receptors (RLRs). In response to cytoplasmatic viral dsRNA, RLRs activate an antiviral immune response that includes the elevation of antigen presentation. Thus, it was postulated that in low-immunogenic tumor models, RLR activation in tumor cells prior to the induction of their death by DaRT will be superior compared to TLR activation. Intratumoral cytoplasmatic delivery of the dsRNA mimic polyIC by polyethylenimine (PEI), was used to activate RLR, while polyIC without PEI was used to activate TLR. PolyIC(PEI) prior to DaRT synergistically retarded 4T1 triple-negative breast tumors and metastasis development more efficiently than polyIC and rejected panc02 pancreatic tumors in some of the treated mice. Splenocytes from treated mice, adoptively transferred to naive mice in combination with 4T1 tumor cells, delayed tumor development compared to naïve splenocytes. Low-dose cyclophosphamide, known to reduce T regulatory cell number, enhanced the effect of DaRT and polyIC(PEI) and led to high long-term survival rates under neoadjuvant settings, which confirmed metastasis clearance. The epigenetic drug decitabine, known to activate RLR in low doses, was given intraperitoneally prior to DaRT and caused tumor growth retardation, similar to local polyIC(PEI). The systemic and/or local administration of RLR activators was also tested in the squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tumor model SQ2, in which a delay in tumor re-challenge development was demonstrated. We conclude that RIG-I-like activation prior to intratumoral alpha radiation may serve as a potent combination technique to reduce both tumor growth and the spread of distant metastases in low-immunogenic and metastatic tumor models.;polyisoleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

3569;10861001;Isolation and characterization of BEN, a member of the TFII-I family of DNA-binding proteins containing distinct helix-loop-helix domains.;The transcriptional regulation of the Hoxc8 gene is controlled during early mouse embryogenesis by an enhanceosome-like control region, termed the early enhancer (EE), located 3 kb upstream from the Hoxc8 translation start site. The EE is involved in establishing the posterior expression pattern of Hoxc8 at embryonic day (E) 8.5-9. 0. Genetic and biochemical data have shown that nuclear factors interact with this region in a sequence-specific manner. We have used a yeast one-hybrid screen in a search for transcription factors that bind to EE motifs and have isolated a novel murine DNA-binding protein, termed BEN (binding factor for early enhancer). The ORF of BEN encodes a protein of 1072 amino acids and contains six helix-loop-helix domains, a hydrophobic leucine zipper-like motif, and a serine-rich repeat. The murine BEN gene is structurally similar to the human gene TFII-I in that both genes encode unique 95-amino acid long helix-loop/span-helix domains. The BEN gene produces several major transcripts (3.6, 4.4, and 5.9 kb) present in most adult tissues and shows discrete spatial and temporal domains of expression in areas of epithelial-mesenchymal interaction during mouse embryogenesis from E9.5 to E12.5. Several BEN-encoded polypeptides of different sizes ranging from 165 to 40 kDa were identified by Western blot analysis using BEN-specific polyclonal Abs. We propose, on the bases of sequence homology, that BEN is the mouse ortholog of the recently described human gene, WBSCR11, known also as GTF2IRD1, GTF3, Cream1, and MusTRD1. This gene is deleted hemizygously in individuals with Williams Syndrome, an autosomal dominant genetic condition characterized by complex physical, cognitive, and behavioral traits resulting from a perturbed developmental process. ;polyserine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

3572;28872880;Identification of Potential Small Molecule Binding Pockets in p38α MAP Kinase.;Given the essential role played by protein kinases in regulating cellular pathways, their dysregulation can result in the onset and/or progression of various human diseases. Structural analysis of diverse protein kinases suggests that these proteins exhibit a remarkable plasticity that allows them to adopt distinct conformations in response to interactions with other proteins, providing an opportunity for designing allosteric modulators. The present work reports the results of an in silico screening study aimed at identifying novel prospective allosteric binding sites in the paradigmatic p38α MAP kinase. The process was carried out using a protein ensemble generated from a 6 μs accelerated molecular dynamics simulation. The results of this calculation were first used to study the flexibility of the protein using Principal Component Analysis, followed by a Cluster Analysis aimed at producing an ensemble of conformations representative of the sampling process. Representative structures of the diverse clusters were subsequently screened for hot spots using FTMAP. The procedure permitted the identification of diverse allosteric sites of p38α already described in the literature including the DFG pocket, the lipid binding pocket, the DEF site, the docking groove, the CD and ED sites, and the backside site as well as a novel site recently reported: the A-loop regulatory site. Furthermore, the study also permitted the identification of ten novel prospective allosteric sites named NP1 to NP10, involving in most of the cases protein structural elements that control kinase activation including the activation loop, the catalytic loop, the αC helix, the L16 loop, and the glycine-rich loop. ;polyglycine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
3573;20724380;Conservation and evolution in and among SRF- and MEF2-type MADS domains and their binding sites.;Serum response factor (SRF) and myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) represent two types of members of the MCM1, AGAMOUS, DEFICIENS, and SRF (MADS)-box transcription factor family present in animals and fungi. Each type has distinct biological functions, which are reflected by the distinct specificities of the proteins bound to their cognate DNA-binding sites and activated by their respective cofactors. However, little is known about the evolution of MADS domains and their DNA-binding sites. Here, we report on the conservation and evolution of the two types of MADS domains with their cognate DNA-binding sites by using phylogenetic analyses. First, there are great similarities between the two types of proteins with amino acid positions highly conserved, which are critical for binding to the DNA sequence and for the maintenance of the 3D structure. Second, in contrast to MEF2-type MADS domains, distinct conserved residues are present at some positions in SRF-type MADS domains, determining specificity and the configuration of the MADS domain bound to DNA sequences. Furthermore, the ancestor sequence of SRF- and MEF2-type MADS domains is more similar to MEF2-type MADS domains than to SRF-type MADS domains. In the case of DNA-binding sites, the MEF2 site has a T-rich core in one DNA sequence and an A-rich core in the reverse sequence as compared with the SRF site, no matter whether where either A or T is present in the two complementary sequences. In addition, comparing SRF sites in the human and the mouse genomes reveals that the evolution rate of CArG-boxes is faster in mouse than in human. Moreover, interestingly, a CArG-like sequence, which is probably functionless, could potentially mutate to a functional CArG-box that can be bound by SRF and vice versa. Together, these results significantly improve our knowledge on the conservation and evolution of the MADS domains and their binding sites to date and provide new insights to investigate the MADS family, which is not only on evolution of MADS factors but also on evolution of their binding sites and even on coevolution of MADS factors with their binding sites. ;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
3577;1657953;Substitution of arginine for histidine at position 209 in the alpha-subunit of the human insulin receptor. A mutation that impairs receptor dimerization and transport of receptors to the cell surface.;Receptors for insulin and epidermal growth factor contain cysteine-rich domains in the extracellular portion of the molecule. His209 (insulin receptor numbering system) is 1 of 2 amino acid residues that are identically conserved in the cysteine-rich domains of insulin receptors, epidermal growth factor receptors, and other homologous receptors. Previously, we have identified a patient with leprechaunism who is homozygous for a mutation substituting Arg for His209 in the insulin receptor gene (Kadowaki, T., Kadowaki, H., Rechler, M. M., Serrano-Rios, M., Roth, J., Gorden, P., and Taylor, S. I. (1990) J. Clin. Invest. 86, 254-264). In this investigation, the Arg209 mutant receptor was expressed by transfection of mutant cDNA into NIH-3T3 cells. The mutation impairs several steps in the post-translational processing of the insulin receptor:dimerization of 190-kDa proreceptors into a disulfide linked species, proteolytic cleavage of the proreceptor into alpha- and beta-subunits, and terminal processing of the high mannose form of N-linked oligosaccharide into complex carbohydrate. In addition, the defects in post-translational processing within the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus are associated with a marked inhibition in transport of receptors to the plasma membrane. Nevertheless, a small number (approximately 10%) of the receptors are transported to the cell surface. These receptors on the cell surface bind insulin with normal affinity and have normal tyrosine kinase activity.;polycysteine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
3580;16553883;The toxbox: specific DNA sequence requirements for activation of Vibrio cholerae virulence genes by ToxT.;The Gram-negative, curved rod Vibrio cholerae causes the severe diarrhoeal disease cholera. The two major virulence factors produced by V. cholerae during infection are the cholera toxin (CT) and the toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP). Transcription of the genes encoding both CT and the components of the TCP is directly activated by ToxT, a transcription factor in the AraC/XylS family. ToxT binds upstream of the ctxAB genes, encoding CT, and upstream of tcpA, the first gene in a large operon encoding the components of the TCP. The DNA sequences upstream of ctxAB and tcpA that contain ToxT binding sites do not have any significant similarity other than being AT-rich. Extensive site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the region upstream of tcpA previously shown to be protected by ToxT, and we identified specific base pairs important for activation of tcpA transcription by ToxT. This genetic approach was complemented by copper-phenanthroline footprinting experiments that showed protection by ToxT of the base pairs identified as most important for transcription activation in the mutagenesis experiments. Based on this new information and on previous work, we propose the presence of a ToxT-binding motif - the 'toxbox'- in promoters regulated by ToxT. At tcpA, two toxbox elements are present in a direct repeat configuration and both are required for activation of transcription by ToxT. The identity of only a few of the base pairs within the toxbox is important for activation by ToxT, and we term these the core toxbox elements. Lastly, we examined ToxT binding to a mutant having 5 bp inserted between the two toxboxes at tcpA and found that occupancy of both binding sites is retained regardless of the positions of the binding sites relative to each other on the face of the DNA. This suggests that ToxT binds independently as a monomer to each toxbox in the tcpA direct repeat, in accordance with what we observed previously with the inverted repeat ToxT sites between acfA and acfD. ;polythreonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
3581;8388381;DNA polymerase alpha stimulates the ATP-dependent binding of simian virus tumor T antigen to the SV40 origin of replication.;The ATP-dependent binding of simian virus 40 (SV40) large tumor antigen (T antigen) to the SV40 origin of replication is an essential step in the initiation of SV40 DNA synthesis. Previous studies indicated that the ATP-dependent complex consists of a double hexamer of T antigen at the origin. The binding reaction and the subsequent unwinding of the duplex DNA from the origin were examined using a gel mobility shift assay. T antigen bound to the core origin cooperatively in the presence of ATP. In the presence of human single-stranded DNA-binding protein (HSSB), T antigen, complexed to the core origin, started the unwinding of duplex DNA. At low concentrations of T antigen and in the presence of ATP, DNA polymerase alpha (pol alpha) stimulated the binding of T antigen to the core origin, while HSSB did not. This stimulation resulted in an increase in the subsequent unwinding reaction in the presence of HSSB. Primase alone did not affect the binding reaction and was not required for the stimulation by pol alpha. The stimulation required the hydrolysis of ATP and the AT tract domain of the core origin. Kinetic studies showed that while pol alpha stimulated the binding of T antigen to the core origin, it did not stabilize the complex. Pol alpha also stimulated the formation of the ATP-dependent T antigen-site I complex, a region that also contains an AT-rich sequence. These observations imply a regulatory role for pol alpha in the initiation of SV40 DNA replication. ;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
3583;11891047;Allelic variation in the highly polymorphic locus pspC of Streptococcus pneumoniae.;PspC, also called SpsA, CbpA, PbcA, and Hic, is a surface protein of Streptococcus pneumoniae studied for its antigenic properties, its capability to bind secretory IgA, C3 and complement factor H, and its activity as an adhesin. In this work we characterized the pspC locus of 43 pneumococcal strains by DNA sequencing of PCR fragments. Using PCR primers designed on two unrelated open reading frames, flanking the pspC locus, it was possible to amplify the pspC locus of each of the 43 strains of S. pneumoniae. In 37 out of 43 strains there was a single copy of the pspC gene, while two tandem copies of pspC were found in the other six strains. The sequence of the pspC locus was different in each of the 43 strains. Insertion sequences were found in the pspC locus of 11 out of 43 strains. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of the PspC variants showed a common organization of the molecules: (i) a 37 amino acid leader peptide which is conserved in all proteins, (ii) an N-terminal portion which is essentially alpha-helical, and is the result of assembly of eight major sequence blocks, (iii) a proline-rich region, and (iv) a C-terminal anchor responsible for the cell surface attachment. By sequence comparison we identified 11 major groups of PspC proteins. Proteins within one group displayed only minor variations of the amino acid sequence. An unexpected finding was that PspC variants could differ in the anchor sequence. While 32 of the PspC proteins displayed the typical choline binding domain of pneumococcal surface proteins, 17 other PspCs showed the LPXTG motif, which is typical of surface proteins of other gram-positive bacteria. This major difference in the anchor region was also observed in the adjacent proline-rich regions which differed considerably in size and composition. ;polyproline;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
3584;2555548;Topoisomerase I sites cluster asymmetrically at the ends of the simian virus 40 core origin of replication.;In vivo, topoisomerase I cleavage sites are located predominantly on the strands of simian virus 40 DNA that are the templates for discontinuous synthesis (S.E. Porter and J.J. Champoux, Mol. Cell. Biol. 9:541-550, 1989). This arrangement of sites suggests that topoisomerase I may associate with replication complexes in unique functional orientations at replication forks. We have mapped topoisomerase I cleavage sites in the simian virus 40 origin of replication in vitro under conditions suitable for DNA replication. Numerous sites cluster in the inverted repeat and AT-rich domains at the ends of the core origin and are arranged on the same strands that are cut most frequently in vivo. We propose that cleavage at these sites would allow bidirectional extension of the replication bubble induced by T antigen within the core origin of replication early in the initiation of DNA synthesis. A mutational analysis of the topoisomerase I sites confirms the importance of positions -4 to -1 and +1 in the consensus sequence 5'-A/T-A/G-A/T-T-break-G/A-3'. Surprisingly, more distant nucleotide positions also influence topoisomerase I sites in the inverted repeat and AT-rich domains of the core origin. The effects of distant sequences could be mediated by direct interactions with topoisomerase I or by the conformation of DNA in the core origin. ;polythreonine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
3586;11600718;A novel yeast system for in vivo selection of recognition sequences: defining an optimal c-Myb-responsive element.;Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) has proved to be a highly valuable tool in a range of screening methods. We present in this work the design and use of a novel yeast effector-reporter system for selection of sequences recognised by DNA-binding proteins in vivo. A dual HIS3-lacZ reporter under the control of a single randomised response element facilitates both positive growth selection of binding sequences and subsequent quantification of the strength of the selected sequence. A galactose-inducible effector allows discrimination between reporter activation caused by the protein under study and activation due to endogenous factors. The system mimics the physiological gene dosage relationship between transcription factor and target genes in vivo by using a low copy effector plasmid and a high copy reporter plasmid, favouring sequence selectivity. The utility of the novel yeast screening system was demonstrated by using it to refine the definition of an optimal recognition element for the c-Myb transcription factor (MRE). We present screening data supporting an extended MRE consensus closely mimicking known strong response elements and where a sequence of 11 nt influences activity. Novel features include a more strict sequence requirement in the second half-site of the MRE where a T-rich sequence is preferred in vivo. ;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
3587;2892762;A genomic clone containing the promoter for the gene encoding the human lysosomal enzyme, alpha-galactosidase A.;We have isolated and characterized a human genomic clone for a lysosomal enzyme gene. The start point of transcription was identified using primer extension of poly(A)+ mRNA. This genomic clone is specific for human alpha-galactosidase A, and it includes sequences for the promoter, complete signal peptide, first exon, and part of the first intron. Direct and inverted repeat elements of 10, 11, 16, 19, and 22 nucleotides (nt) flank the promoter site. A (GA)n repeat element of approx. 60 nt with strong homology to similar elements identified in several species is located upstream from the promoter. A GGGCGG site specific for DNA-binding protein Sp1 is located near a CAAT box, and the CCGCCC inverted repeat of the Sp1 binding sequence is located by the TATA box. The sequence immediately flanking the ATG start codon of the human alpha-galactosidase A is highly homologous to sequences flanking the ATG start codons of the other human lysosomal hydrolases for which sequence information is available (beta-glucocerebrosidase, cathepsin B, cathepsin D, and beta-hexosaminidase alpha chain), but not for any of the other 133 human signal peptides examined. Our analysis also reveals that conversion of the propeptide to the mature enzyme involves cleavage of a C-terminal rather than an N-terminal fragment. This information about the normal alpha-galactosidase A gene will be useful for comparison to data obtained from patients with Fabry disease, who are characterized by a deficiency of this enzyme. This is the first genomic clone described to date for any lysosomal enzyme, and it establishes a reference for future analyses of the molecular events that mediate the expression of this important class of enzymes. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
3594;11994446;Priming Th1 immunity to viral core particles is facilitated by trace amounts of RNA bound to its arginine-rich domain.;Particulate hepatitis B core Ag (C protein) (HBcAg) and soluble hepatitis B precore Ag (E protein) (HBeAg) of the hepatitis B virus share >70% of their amino acid sequence and most T and B cell-defined epitopes. When injected at low doses into mice, HBcAg particles prime Th1 immunity while HBeAg protein primes Th2 immunity. HBcAg contains 5-20 ng RNA/microg protein while nucleotide binding to HBeAg is not detectable. Deletion of the C-terminal arginine-rich domain of HBcAg generates HBcAg-144 or HBcAg-149 particles (in which >98% of RNA binding is lost) that prime Th2-biased immunity. HBcAg particles, but not truncated HBcAg-144 or -149 particles stimulate IL-12 p70 release by dendritic cells and IFN-gamma release by nonimmune spleen cells. The injection of HBeAg protein or HBcAg-149 particles into mice primes Th1 immunity only when high doses of RNA (i.e., 20-100 microg/mouse) are codelivered with the Ag. Particle-incorporated RNA has thus a 1000-fold higher potency as a Th1-inducing adjuvant than free RNA mixed to a protein Ag. Disrupting the particulate structure of HBcAg releases RNA and abolishes its Th1 immunity inducing potency. Using DNA vaccines delivered intradermally with the gene gun, inoculation of 1 microg HBcAg-encoding pCI/C plasmid DNA primes Th1 immunity while inoculation of 1 microg HBeAg-encoding pCI/E plasmid DNA or HBcAg-149-encoding pCI/C-149 plasmid DNA primes Th2 immunity. Expression data show eukaryotic RNA associated with HBcAg, but not HBeAg, expressed by the DNA vaccine. Hence, codelivery of an efficient, intrinsic adjuvant (i.e., nanogram amounts of prokaryotic or eukaryotic RNA bound to arginine-rich sequences) by HBcAg nucleocapsids facilitates priming of anti-viral Th1 immunity. ;polyarginine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
3596;11674997;Transcriptional regulation of the mosquito vitellogenin gene via a blood meal-triggered cascade.;In anautogenous mosquitoes, a blood meal is required for activation of genes encoding yolk protein precursors (YPP). Vitellogenin (Vg), the major YPP gene, is transcribed at a very high level following blood meal activation. It is expressed exclusively in the female fat body, the tissue producing most of mosquito hemolymph and immune proteins. In this paper, we analyzed the upstream region of the Aedes aegypti Vg gene in order to identify regulatory elements responsible for its unique expression pattern. To achieve this goal, we analyzed the gene using transgenic Drosophila and Aedes as well as DNA-binding assays. These analyses revealed three regulatory regions in the 2.1 kb upstream portion of the Vg gene. The proximal region containing binding sites to EcR/USP, GATA, C/EBP and HNF3/fkh is required for the correct tissue- and stage-specific expression at a low level. The median region carrying sites for early ecdysone response factors E74 and E75 is responsible for hormonal enhancement of Vg expression. Finally, the distal GATA-rich region is necessary for extremely high expression levels characteristic of the Vg gene. The present work elucidates the molecular basis of blood meal-dependent expression of this mosquito gene, laying the foundation for mosquito-specific expression cassettes with predictable stage and tissue specificity. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Five women underwent teflon therapy as the first operation performed on them. Seven women had had one operation before and the rest more than one. Continence was restored in 6 patients (30 per cent), and 3 patients (15 per cent) were improved. The presurgical situation was of minor influence. The definite result was outlined as early as three months from surgery. Urodynamically, Teflon had a favourable impact primarily on functional urethral length and on the stress quotient. However, elevation of the bladder base was radiographically detectable in less numerous cases. Only partial agreement was found to exist between objectivated improvement and subjectively perceived and reported therapeutic results, with falsely positive and falsely negative findings occurring with equal frequency. Micturition was insubstantially impaired by Teflon.

3599;8138425;Fine tuning of linear accelerator accessories for stereotactic radiotherapy.;"PURPOSE
Experience with the University of Wisconsin's stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) accessory system was applied to build a new system, facilitate alignment of linac photon beams with a Brown-Roberts-Wells (BRW) stereotaxy, and increase the versatility and stability of the stereotaxy.


METHODS AND MATERIALS
High tensile strength stainless steel was used in the floor stand to increase the range of gantry rotation relative to ranges allowed by truss-mounted stands. The collimator assembly and floor stand were each fitted with two-axis gimbal and translation adjustments in addition to the floor stand's three-axis adjustments. The head ring positioning assembly was fitted with two braces to prevent the head ring from deforming with patient motion. Six MV linac photon beam characteristics were measured with a computer-controlled scanning system and a diode in water, at source to surface distances (SSD) of 80 and 100 cm, and for 13 divergent collimators ranging in diameter from 1-4 cm at 100 cm SSD. Quality assurance software was applied to screen data for questionable consistency or symmetry. Integrity of the stereotaxy was evaluated with target simulation films and repeated measurements which were part of the quality assurance of clinical treatments. A method was developed using a glass etched contact reticle to obtain average simulated target to beam center distances (delta av) from target simulation films.


RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
New aspects of the current system have improved the ability to fine tune and analyze stereotactic alignment. Beam characteristics met stringent output criteria and penumbral widths were the same or narrower than penumbral widths reported elsewhere. The precision of measuring delta av was 0.1 mm, and delta av averaged over 50 target simulation films was 0.7 +/- 0.1 mm. Results suggest that it may be useful to determine delta av from target simulation films with the method described here.";-;-;-;hard_0
3602;26676274;Molecular cloning and functional characterization of murine toll‑like receptor 8.;"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a large family of germ-line encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns and evoke the relevant innate immune responses. TLR8 is a member of several endosome nucleic acid-sensing TLRs; however little attention has been paid to murine TLR8 (mTLR8) compared with other endosome nucleic acid-sensing TLRs. In the present study, mTLR8 was cloned using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from murine peripheral blood mononuclear cells and its function in regulating innate immune response was characterized. The open reading frame of mTLR8 consists of 3,099 bps and encodes 1,032 amino acids. It contains typical leucine-rich repeats, a transmembrane domain and a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain, and it shares a high level of identity with other mammalian species. The expression of mTLR8 has been widely observed in different tissues, and higher expression levels of mTLR8 have mainly been detected in the heart, spleen and lung. Overexpression of mTLR8 is required for the activation of transcription factor nuclear factor-κB and the production of tumor necrosis factor-α. However, mTLR8 is not able to activate interferon regulatory factor 3 or activator protein 1, nor can it induce interferon-α in HEK293T cells. These results indicate that mTLR8, as an important PRR, is indeed functional and is vital role in the activation of innate immune responses. This study may aid in determining the molecular basis of the interactions between mTLR8 and pathogens. ";polyleucine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

3607;9755676;Aspiration cytology of ectopic cervical thymoma mimicking a thyroid mass. A case report.;"BACKGROUND
Ectopic cervical thymoma, first described in 1941 by Boman, is an uncommon tumor of the neck displaying the same histologic features as mediastinal thymoma. Since it is commonly located in the anterolateral part of the neck or is subjacent to or inside the lower pole of the thyroid, the mass is often confused as being of thyroid origin.


CASE
A 68-year-old female presented with dyspnea and an anterior neck mass found on routine chest roentgenography. The thyroid scan showed a cold nodule in the lower pole of the left part of the thyroid. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology revealed large numbers of small lymphocytes with hyperchromatic nuclei and frequent clumping pattern in the pale, eosinophilic, fluid background. A few clusters of epithelial cells without atypism were interpreted as thyroid follicular cells. The overall cytologic features were misinterpreted as malignant lymphoma of the thyroid. However, the histologic diagnosis was thymoma, predominantly cortical type.


CONCLUSION
The ectopic cervical thymoma is sometimes misdiagnosed as Hashimoto's thyroiditis, anaplastic carcinoma and malignant lymphoma of thyroid on FNA cytology or frozen diagnosis due to its rarity.

Histopathological, ultrastructural and enzyme cytochemical studies of tissue reactions.;The present experiment was performed in order to analyze and compare the histopathological features of Candida infection in various states of host defense capacity. The pulmonary lesions were induced by an intratracheal inoculation of 10(8) live cells of Candida albicans into each of the rabbits in the following 4 groups: 1) untreated controls, 2) animals sensitized non-specifically to bovine serum albumin (BSA), 3) those sensitized specifically to formalin-killed C. albicans cells, and 4) those treated with cyclophosphamide and mitomycin C. The animals were sacrificed at appropriate intervals up to 16 days after inoculation. At autopsy, the lungs were cultured and then subjected to histopathological, electron microscopic and enzyme cytochemical examinations. In the healthy control animals, the fungal lesions consisted of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) at the initial stage, gradually changing to granulomatous inflammation, which contained no peroxidase-positive macrophages. In the animals sensitized non-specifically to BSA exudative macrophages appeared in the lesions, the nature of which did not differ from that of the control animals. In the animals sensitized specifically to Candida cells, more extensive infiltration of PMN was observed at the initial stage, a fact which may suggest the participation of the Arthus phenomenon in the development of the lesions. Furthermore, an epithelioid cell transformation of the macrophages in the granulomatous lesions may also suggest that immune complexes contributed to their formation. In the drug-treated animals, the lesions consisted of necrotic or less prominent cellular foci which correspond to the features of human candidiasis in debilitated states, and the inoculated fungi grew progressively to form pseudohyphae. An asteroid structure protruding radially from the surface of the fungal cells and attaching to primary lysosomes in the phagocytes was observed occasionally. This structure seems to be formed when the function of the phagocytes in the defense mechanisms against the fungi is suppressed to some extent. From the results of the present experiment, we would emphasize that PMN play an initial role in the elimination of C. albicans cells in the lung, and that macrophages then contribute to the formation of the lesions immunologically or non-immunologically.;-;-;-;hard_0
3611;8046329;Identification of the erythrocyte binding domains of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium knowlesi proteins involved in erythrocyte invasion.;Plasmodium vivax and the related monkey malaria, P. knowlesi, require interaction with the Duffy blood group antigen, a receptor for a family of chemokines that includes interleukin 8, to invade human erythrocytes. One P. vivax and three P. knowlesi proteins that serve as erythrocyte binding ligands in such interactions share sequence homology. Expression of different regions of the P. vivax protein in COS7 cells identified a cysteine-rich domain that bound Duffy blood group-positive but not Duffy blood group-negative human erythrocytes. The homologous domain of the P. knowlesi proteins also bound erythrocytes, but had different specificities. The P. vivax and P. knowlesi binding domains lie in one of two regions of homology with the P. falciparum sialic acid binding protein, another erythrocyte binding ligand, indicating conservation of the domain for erythrocyte binding in evolutionarily distant malaria species. The binding domains of these malaria ligands represent potential vaccine candidates and targets for receptor-blockade therapy.;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
3613;21724598;Molecular design of a splicing switch responsive to the RNA binding protein Tra2β.;Tra2β regulates a number of splicing switches including activation of the human testis-specific exon HIPK3-T in the Homeodomain Interacting Protein Kinase 3 gene. By testing HIPK3-T exons of different intrinsic strengths, we found Tra2β most efficiently activated splicing inclusion of intrinsically weak exons, although these were spliced at a lower overall level. Both the RRM and N-terminal RS-rich region of Tra2β were required for splicing activation. Bioinformatic searches for splicing enhancers and repressors mapped four physically distinct exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) within HIPK3-T, each containing the known Tra2β AGAA-rich binding site. Surprisingly disruption of each single ESE prevented Tra2β-mediated activation, although single mutated exons could still bind Tra2β protein by gel shifts and functional splicing analyses. Titration experiments indicate an additive model of HIPK3-T splicing activation, requiring availability of an array of four distinct ESEs to enable splicing activation. To enable this efficient Tra2β-mediated splicing switch to operate, a closely adjacent downstream and potentially competitive stronger 5'-splice site is actively repressed. Our data indicate that a novel arrangement of multiple mono-specific AGAA-rich ESEs coupled to a weak 5'-splice site functions as a responsive gauge. This gauge monitors changes in the specific nuclear concentration of the RNA binding protein Tra2β, and co-ordinately regulates HIPK3-T exon splicing inclusion. ;polyserine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
3617;26679370;The colour of an avifauna: A quantitative analysis of the colour of Australian birds.;Animal coloration is a poorly-understood aspect of phenotypic variability. Here I expand initial studies of the colour gamut of birds by providing the first quantitative description of the colour variation of an entire avifauna: Australian landbirds (555 species). The colour of Australian birds occupies a small fraction (19%) of the entire possible colour space and colour variation is extremely uneven. Most colours are unsaturated, concentrated in the centre of colour space and based on the deposition of melanins. Other mechanisms of colour production are less common but account for larger portions of colour space and for most saturated colours. Male colours occupy 45-25% more colour space than female colours, indicating that sexual dichromatism translates into a broader range of male colours. Male-exclusive colours are often saturated, at the edge of chromatic space, and have most likely evolved for signalling. While most clades of birds occupy expected or lower-than-expected colour volumes, parrots and cockatoos (Order Psittaciformes) occupy a much larger volume than expected. This uneven distribution of colour variation across mechanisms of colour production, sexes and clades is probably shared by avifaunas in other parts of the world, but this remains to be tested with comparable data.;-;-;-;hard_0
3618;20463424;Type 2 diabetes: an expanded view of pathophysiology and therapy.;Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a complicated metabolic disease affecting millions of individuals worldwide. The medications used to manage the disease are based on different pharmacologic approaches, including decreasing hepatic gluconeogenesis, stimulating pancreatic insulin production, slowing polysaccharide digestion, and increasing insulin sensitivity in muscle, liver, and fat to lower blood glucose. Incretin-based therapies, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, mimic the effects of native GLP-1, while dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors increase circulating concentrations of endogenous GLP-1. This review focuses on means by which primary care physicians might evaluate the utility of pharmacologic agents based on their relation to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. In general, patients with type 2 diabetes should be treated to their lowest targeted glycemic goals as soon as they are diagnosed, for as long as possible, as safely as possible, and as rationally as possible.;-;-;-;hard_0
3619;203598;A deoxyribonucleic acid unwinding protein isolated from regenerating rat liver. Physical and functional properties.;A DNA-unwinding protein has been purified from regenerating rat liver cytosol to apparent homogeneity. The protein is present in about 10(6) copies per cell. It is a tetramer, composed of 25,000-dalton subunits which does not exhibit enzymatic activity for ATPase, DNA polymerase, or DNase. The protein is able to unwind the double helix of poly[d(A-T)], depressing the melting point of this synthetic polymer by about 40 degrees. It also binds to supercoiled SV40 DNA, probably by melting A-T-rich regions in the genome. The fully saturated complex of protein and SV40 DNA sediments at 30 S.

3621;31471525;Early Life Represents a Vulnerable Time Window for IL-33-Induced Peripheral Lung Pathology.;IL-33, an IL-1 family cytokine, is constitutively expressed in mucosal tissues and other organs in healthy humans and animals, and expression levels increase in inflammatory conditions. Although IL-33-mediated promotion of type 2 immune responses has been well established, a gap in our knowledge regarding the functional diversity of this pleiotropic cytokine remains. To address this gap, we developed a new IL-33 transgenic mouse model in which overexpression of full-length IL-33 is induced in lung epithelial cells under conditional control. In adult mice, an ∼3-fold increase in the steady-state IL-33 levels produced no pathologic effects in the lungs. When exposed to airborne allergens, adult transgenic mice released more IL-33 extracellularly and exhibited robust type 2 immune responses. In neonatal transgenic mice, up to postnatal day 14, a similar increase in steady-state IL-33 levels resulted in increased mortality, enlarged alveolar spaces resembling bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and altered expression of genes associated with tissue morphogenesis. Processed 25-kDa IL-33 protein was detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids without any exogenous stimuli, and pathologic changes were abolished in mice deficient in the IL-33 receptor ST2. These findings suggest that adult lungs are relatively resistant to IL-33 overexpression unless they encounter environmental insults, whereas developing lungs are highly susceptible, with IL-33 overexpression resulting in detrimental and pathologic outcomes.;-;-;-;hard_0
3622;10527767;Adenovirus-mediated acidic fibroblast growth factor gene transfer induces angiogenesis in the nonischemic rabbit heart.;Most patients with severe coronary artery disease have normal baseline myocardial blood flow. Therefore, interventions aimed at inducing therapeutic angiogenesis in these patients should cause new blood vessel growth in the heart in the absence of chronic ischemia. It was examined whether adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of recombinant, secreted acidic fibroblast growth factor (sp+aFGF(1-154)), next to a major epicardial artery, may induce neovascularization and reduce the risk region for myocardial infarction upon coronary ligation near the injection site. Fifteen days prior to coronary artery occlusion, rabbits were treated with intramyocardial injections of AdCMV.sp+aFGF(1-154), the control vector AdCMV.NLSbetagal (1 x 10(9) plaque-forming units), or saline. Messenger RNA transcripts for aFGF(1-154) were present up to 12 days after injection in the tissues exposed to AdCMV.aFGF(1-154). Following coronary artery occlusion rabbits treated with AdCMV. sp+aFGF(1-154) showed a 50% reduction of the risk region for myocardial infarction (P < 0.01 vs control). Histologic analysis showed a twofold increase in length density of intramural coronary arterioles (P < 0.01 vs control) and a 17% increase in length density of the capillary network (P < 0.001) in the myocardium exposed to AdCMV.sp+aFGF(1-154). Thus, gene therapy with AdCMV. sp+aFGF(1-154) can induce angiogenesis in the absence of chronic ischemia. The newly formed collateral blood vessels provide an anatomical basis for the reduction in the risk region for myocardial infarction upon subsequent occlusion of the coronary artery in proximity of the site where angiogenesis was induced.;-;-;-;hard_0

An estimated graphical probabilistic model describing the relationship between a set of risk factors and the corresponding risk of breast cancer is used for this analysis, together with a Bayesian network modeling screening test results conditional on the true (but unknown) breast cancer status of a woman. This study contributes towards evaluating a possibility of improving the efficiency of the screening program, where all women aged 50 to 69 are invited every second year, regardless of individual risk factors.

We transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing Fuc-TIII with beta3Gal-T cDNAs and studied the relevant glycoconjugates formed. beta3Gal-T5 directs synthesis of Lewis type 1 antigens in CHO cells more efficiently than beta3Gal-T1, whereas beta3Gal-T2, -T3, and -T4 are almost unable to direct synthesis. In the clone expressing Fuc-TIII and beta3Gal-T5 (CHO-FT-T5), sialyl-Lewis a synthesis is strongly inhibited by swainsonine but not by benzyl-alpha-GalNAc, and sialyl-Lewis x is absent, although it is detected in the clones expressing Fuc-TIII and beta3Gal-T1 (CHO-FT-T1) or Fuc-TIII and beta3Gal-T2 (CHO-FT-T2). Endo-beta-galactosidase treatment of N- glycans prepared from clone CHO-FT-T5 releases (+/-NeuAcalpha2-->3)Galbeta1-->3[Fucalpha1-->4]GlcNAcbeta1-->3Gal but not GlcNAcbeta1-->3Gal or type 2 chain oligosaccharides, which are found in CHO-FT-T1 cells. This result indicates that beta3Gal-T5 expression prevents poly-N-acetyllactosamine and sialyl-Lewis x synthesis on N-glycans. Kinetic studies confirm that beta3Gal-T5 prefers acceptors having the GlcNAcbeta1-->3Gal end, including lactotriosylceramide. Competitive reverse transcriptase mediated-polymerase chain reaction shows that the beta3Gal-T5 transcript is expressed in normal colon mucosa but not or poorly in adenocarcinomas. Moreover, recombinant carcinoembryonic antigen purified from a CHO clone expressing Fuc-TIII and beta3Gal-T5 reacts with anti-sialyl-Lewis a and carries type 1 chains on oligosaccharides released by endo-beta-galactosidase. We conclude that beta3Gal-T5 down-regulation plays a relevant role in determining the cancer-associated glycosylation pattern of N-glycans. ;polyasparagine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
3627;1569120;The beta 4 subunit of the integrin family is displayed on a restricted subset of endothelium in mice.;More than 15 subunits of the integrin family of cell surface adhesion molecules have been identified. The alpha 6 beta 4 integrin has recently been identified as a component of hemidesmosomes of stratified squamous epithelium. The monoclonal antibody (mAb) 346-11A binds to the beta 4 subunit in mice. Sequence analysis of a cDNA clone coding for this epitope localizes reaction of the mAb to a portion about half way through the extracellular domain at the beginning of the cysteine-rich region. Sites of beta 4 expression in mice were detected by autoradiographic analysis of tissues collected from mice 24 or 48 h after intravenous injection of 125I-labeled mAb 346-11A. This non-quantitative technique emphasizes detection of antigen exposed in the vascular space. These data show that in addition to the epithelia of several organs, the endothelia of intermediate vessels throughout the body are sites of beta 4 expression. In particular, endothelium of larger vessels but not capillaries in lung, vessels in thymus, spleen and Peyer's patches, and portal vessels but not the central veins of the liver, are positive. The expression of the beta 4 integrin in blood vessels may indicate a specialized function for beta 4 at these sites that is distinct from its role in hemidesmosome-mediated attachment. ;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
3631;18559377;A peptide accelerating the conversion of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 to an inactive latent state.;The serpin plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is a specific inhibitor of plasminogen activators and a potential therapeutic target in cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Accordingly, formation of a basis for development of specific PAI-1-inactivating agents is of great interest. One possible inactivation mode for PAI-1 is conversion to the inactive, so-called latent state. We have now screened a phage-displayed peptide library with PAI-1 as bait and isolated a 31-residue cysteine-rich peptide that will be referred to as paionin-4. A recombinant protein consisting of paionin-4 fused to domains 1 and 2 of the phage coat protein g3p caused a 2- to 3-fold increase in the rate of spontaneous inactivation of PAI-1. Paionin-4-D1D2 bound PAI-1 with a K(D) in the high nanomolar range. Using several biochemical and biophysical methods, we demonstrate that paionin-4-D1D2-stimulated inactivation consists of an acceleration of conversion to the latent state. As demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis and competition with other PAI-1 ligands, the binding site for paionin-4 was localized in the loop between alpha-helix D and beta-strand 2A. We also demonstrate that a latency-inducing monoclonal antibody has an overlapping, but not identical binding site, and accelerates latency transition by another mechanism. Our results show that paionin-4 inactivates PAI-1 by a mechanism clearly different from other peptides, small organochemical compounds, or antibodies, whether they cause inactivation by stimulating latency transition or by other mechanisms, and that the loop between alpha-helix D and beta-strand 2A can be a target for PAI-1 inactivation by different types of compounds. ;polycysteine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
3633;10735869;Domain structure, oligomeric state, and mutational analysis of PpsR, the Rhodobacter sphaeroides repressor of photosystem gene expression.;"The transcription factor PpsR from the facultative photoheterotroph Rhodobacter sphaeroides is involved in repression of photosystem gene expression under aerobic growth conditions. We have isolated a number of spontaneous mutations as well as constructed directed mutations and deletions in ppsR. Repressor activities and the oligomeric state of the wild-type and mutant proteins were assayed. Our results suggest that the wild-type PpsR exists in cell extracts as a tetramer. Analysis of the PpsR mutants confirmed that the carboxy-terminal region of PpsR (residues 400 to 464) is involved in DNA binding. The central region of the protein (residues 150 to 400) was found to contain two PAS domains (residues 161 to 259 and 279 to 367). PAS domains are ubiquitous protein modules involved in sensory transduction as well as in protein-protein interactions. All spontaneously isolated mutations, which significantly impaired repressor activity and which mapped outside the DNA binding region, were positioned in the PAS domains. None of these, however, affected the overall oligomeric state. This implies that the conformation of the PAS domains within the tetramer is critical for repressor activity. Upstream of the first PAS domain resides a putative glutamine-rich hinge (residues 127 to 136) that connects the first PAS domain to the amino-terminal region (residues 1 to 135). The role of the amino terminus of PpsR is not obvious; however, extended deletions within this region abolish repressor activity, thus suggesting that the amino terminus is essential for structural integrity of the protein. We present a model of the domain architecture of the PpsR protein according to which PpsR is comprised of three regions: the carboxy terminus responsible for DNA binding, the central region primarily involved in protein oligomerization and possibly signal sensing, and the amino terminus of unknown function. This model may prove useful for determining the mode of PpsR action. ";polyglutamine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
3643;8600461;Inhibition of transcription factor IIIA-DNA interactions by xenobiotic metal ions.;Transcription factor IIIA (TFIIIA), a cysteine-rich regulatory protein, is the prototype for the largest known superfamily of eukaryotic transcription factors. Members of the TFIIIA superfamily contain Cys2His2 zinc finger domains responsible for nucleic acid binding. Xenobiotic metal ions, which lack known biological function, were previously used as probes for the structure and function of steroid hormone receptors which contain Cys2Cys2 zinc finger domains. Structural alterations in cysteine-rich regulatory proteins by such ions in vivo might potentiate carcinogenesis and other disease processes. In the present study cadmium and other xenobiotic metal ions were used to probe the structure and function of TFIIIA. The specific interaction of TFIIIA with the internal control region (ICR) of the 5S RNA gene, as assayed by DNase I protection, was inhibited by Cd2+ ion concentrations of > or = 0.1 microM. Aluminum ions were also found to inhibit the TFIIIA-5S RNA gene interaction, albeit at higher concentrations (> or = 5 microM). Inhibition by either metal ion was not readily reversible. Other xenobiotic metal ions, such as mercury or cesium, were not found to be inhibitory under these conditions. None of these ions at the concentrations used in this study affected the ability of DNase I to digest DNA or restriction enzymes to specifically cleave DNA. Preincubation of TFIIIA bound to 5S RNA with either Cd2+ or Al3+ resulted in subsequent DNA binding upon dilution and RNA removal, whereas preincubation of free TFIIIA with the metal ions resulted in inhibition of subsequent DNA binding. Because 5S rRNA also binds the TFIIIA zinc finger domains, these results indicate that the 5S RNA bound to TFIIIA protects the protein from metal inhibition and implicates the zinc fingers in the inhibition mechanism. The nature of the footprint inhibition indicates that the N-terminal fingers of TFIIIA are affected by the metal ions. Cd2+ and Al3+ ions also inhibited the ability of TFIIIA to bind complementary single-stranded DNA and promote renaturation, as measured by Tris-phosphate agarose gel electrophoresis. This gel assay is sensitive to DNA conformation and Al3+ ions were found to alter the conformation of single- and double-stranded DNA in this assay. The inhibition of TFIIIA function in vitro by xenobiotic metals offers new insights into the structure and function of TFIIIA and TFIIIA-type zinc finger proteins. Inhibition by Cd2+ occurs at much lower concentrations than previously observed with steroid hormone receptors and suggests that Cys2His2 zinc finger proteins may be especially sensitive to such agents in vivo. ;polycysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function

3651;8047652;Epidemiology of environmental hazards.;Environmental epidemiology faces major obstacles that are well known in epidemiology in general, though often particularly troublesome in studies of environmental hazards. Major problems include misclassification due to imprecise determination of environmental exposures or poor discrimination of nonspecific effects. New insight into reserve capacities of organ function suggest that better markers of early toxicity could be used in environmental epidemiology along with biological markers of exposure. Also, individual susceptibility, whether genetic or not, needs to be explored as a definite source of variable sensitivity to environmental hazards. Epidemiology is of key importance in identifying environmental hazards and in determining the magnitude of risk. However, environmental epidemiology faces problems that are familiar from the general field of epidemiology, but some of these difficulties are of special concern in studies of environmental hazards. Thus, due to the limited span of the exposure interval, misclassification may occur to a considerable degree. The effects are often nonspecific, and attempts are therefore made to identify early markers of adverse effects. The general population consists of individuals with different degrees of susceptibility to toxicity, and this variation can be a source of confounding bias. Thus, a major objective is to increase the power of environmental epidemiology studies.;-;-;-;hard_0
3652;8057437;Ectopic expression of gamma interferon in the eye protects transgenic mice from intraocular herpes simplex virus type 1 infections.;Transgenic (rho gamma) mice provide a model for studying the influence of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) produced in the eye on ocular and cerebral viral infection. To establish this model, we injected BALB/c- and C57BL/6-derived transgenic and nontransgenic mice of different ages intravitreally with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) strain F. Eye and brain tissues of these mice were assessed for pathological and immunocytochemical changes. HSV-1 infection induced severe retinitis of the injected eyes and infection of the brain in all mice. In transgenic mice inoculated with HSV-1, the left, nontreated eyes were protected from retinitis, whereas nontransgenic mice developed bilateral retinitis. Additional intravitreal injection of IFN-gamma with the virus protected the noninoculated eyes of nontransgenic mice. Three-week-old nontransgenic mice died from HSV-1 infection, whereas transgenic mice of the same age and nontransgenic mice intravitreally treated with IFN-gamma survived. Ocular IFN-gamma production increased the extent of inflammation in transgenic mice but did not have a significant influence on the growth of HSV-1 until day 3 after inoculation and did not influence the neuroinvasion of this virus. Thus, the effects of IFN-gamma were not caused by an early block of viral replication. Possible mechanisms of IFN-gamma action include activation of the immune response, alteration of the properties of the virus, and direct protection of neurons.;-;-;-;hard_0

3665;2834249;A muscle-derived substrate-bound factor that promotes neurite outgrowth from neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems.;"The development and survival of spinal motor neurons depends upon muscle-derived trophic factors. Some circumstantial evidence suggested to us that the regulatory subunit of cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (cAMP-dPK)-type II might be involved in neuritic outgrowth from spinal neurons. In the present study, we tested a commercial preparation of cAMP-dPK for neurite-promoting activity. Commercial cAMP-dPK-type II from skeletal and cardiac muscles elicited a significant neurite outgrowth from cultured embryonic chicken neurons when the enzyme preparation was bound to polylysine-coated substrata; type I cAMP-dPK from skeletal muscle was ineffective. Neither cAMP-dPK-type I nor -type II had a significant effect on the survival of spinal neurons in culture. Type II cAMP-dPK also stimulated neurite outgrowth from chicken cerebral hemisphere neurons, dorsal root ganglionic neurons, ciliary ganglionic neurons, and rat sympathetic ganglionic neurons in culture. The neurite-promoting activity appears to reside in a contaminant of the preparation since neither the purified regulatory nor catalytic subunits of cAMP-dPK-type II had an effect on neurite outgrowth per se from cultured neurons and since neurite-promoting activity did not correlate with [3H]cAMP binding or cAMP-dependent kinase activity. The neurite-promoting protein was then partially purified from commercial cAMP-dPK-type II by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 followed by ion-exchange chromatography on DE-52 cellulose. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of the active protein peak revealed a major protein band (MW 50 kDa) and several minor bands (e.g., MW 200 kDa, 52 kDa, 45 kDa). Also, immunoblot analysis and immunoprecipitation revealed that the partially purified neurite-promoting protein was distinct from laminin, heparan sulfate proteoglycan, nerve growth factor, neural cell adhesion molecule, and fibronectin. Furthermore, the neurite-promoting activity was not diminished by treatment with heparinase nor was it bound to heparin conjugated to Sepharose.

3666;8195015;Novel concepts in modification of radiation sensitivity.;"PURPOSE
To determine whether biological effects of radiation, such as apoptosis, that differ from classical clonogenic cell killing, can be modified with agents that would not be expected to modify classical clonogenic cell killing. This would expand the range of potential modifiers of radiation therapy.


METHODS AND MATERIALS
EL4 murine lymphoma cell apoptosis was determined by electrophoretic analysis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragmentation. DNA was extracted 24 h after irradiation or addition of inducing agents. Modifiers of radiation-induced apoptosis were added immediately after irradiation. The effects of radiation on wounded endothelial monolayers were studied by scraping a line across the monolayer 30 min after irradiation. Cell detachment was used as an endpoint to determine the protective effect of prolonged exposure to retinol prior to irradiation.


RESULTS
EL4 cell apoptosis can be induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide or the glutathione oxidant SR-4077. Radiation-induced EL4 cell apoptosis can be inhibited with 3-aminobenzamide, an agent that sensitizes cells to classical clonogenic cell killing. Radiation-induced endothelial cell detachment from confluent monolayers can be modified by pretreatment with retinol.


CONCLUSION
These results raise the possibility that radiation could induce apoptosis by an oxidative stress mechanism that is different from that involved in classical clonogenic cell killing. These and other recent findings encourage the notion that differential modification of classical clonogenic cell killing and other important endpoints of radiation action may be possible.";-;-;-;hard_0
3669;28060517;Thermodynamics of Helix-Coil Transitions of Polyalanine in Open Carbon Nanotubes.;Understanding structure formation in polypeptide chains and synthetic polymers encapsulated in pores is important in biology and nanotechnology. We present replica exchange molecular dynamics studies of the phase diagram for α-helix formation of capped polyalanine in nanotubes (NT) open to a water reservoir as a function of the NT diameter and hydrophobicity. A helix forms only in a narrow range of diameters, which surprisingly is comparable to the width of the ribosome tunnel. Increasing the hydrophobicity enhances helicity in the NT. Helix formation in polyalanine is driven by a small negative enthalpy and a positive entropy change at ≈300 K, in contrast to the large negative entropy change that destabilizes the helix and favors the coiled state in bulk water. There is an anticorrelation between water density inside the nanotube and structure formation. Confinement-induced helix formation depends on amino acid sequence. There is complete absence of helix in polyglutamine and polyserine confined to a open carbon nanotube. ;polyglutamine;helix;-;LCR_with_function

Reduction of the total body aluminum burden was attempted using desferrioxamine (DFO) as a chelating agent. After 6 months, DFO infusion resulted in sustained clinical remission of both neurological and skeletal symptoms, associated with an improvement in the EEG and improved mineralization of bone. A reduction in total body aluminum burden was reflected by reduced skeletal aluminum content, quantitated histochemically in iliac crest bone biopsies before and after DFO therapy. Dramatic increases in serum aluminum levels were documented in the initial weeks of DFO therapy leading to increased removal of aluminum during dialysis; in vitro studies indicated that the ultrafiltrable fraction of serum aluminum increased from 17 to more than 60% after initiating DFO treatment. However, after 6 months of therapy, serum aluminum levels remained unchanged after DFO infusion. These findings suggest that the serum aluminum response to DFO infusion might be a useful reflection of the total-body aluminum burden and also a reflection of the adequacy of a chelation program designed to reduce whole-body aluminum content.";-;-;-;hard_0
3676;19533340;Glycosyltransferase and sulfotransferase gene expression profiles in human monocytes, dendritic cells and macrophages.;Using a focused glycan-gene microarray, we compared the glycosyltransferase (GT) and sulfotransferase gene expression profiles of human monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages (Mphis), isolated or differentiated from the same donors. Microarray analysis indicated that monocytes express transcripts for a full set of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of multi-multiantennary branched N-glycans, potentially elongated by poly-N-acetyl-lactosamine chains, and of mucin-type Core 1 and Core 2 sialylated O-glycans. Monocytes also express genes involved in the biosynthesis and modification of glycosaminoglycans, but display a limited expression of GTs implicated in glycolipid synthesis. Among genes expressed in monocytes (90 out of 175), one third is significantly modulated in DCs and Mphi respectively, most of them being increased in both cell types relative to monocytes. These changes might potentially enforce the capacity of differentiated cells to synthesize branched N-glycans and mucin-type O-glycans and to remodel cell surface proteoglycans. Stimulation of DCs and Mphis with lipopolysaccharide caused a general decrease in gene expression, mainly affecting genes found to be positively modulated during the differentiation steps. Interestingly, although a similar set of enzymes are modulated in the same direction in mature DCs and Mphis, cell specific genes are also differentially regulated during maturation, a phenomenon that may sustain functional specificities. Validation of this analysis was provided by quantitative real-time PCR and flow cytometry of cell surface glycan antigens. Collectively, this study implies an important modification of the pattern of glycosylation in DCs and Mphis undergoing differentiation and maturation with potential biological consequences. ;polyasparagine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
3678;17652321;Structural basis for recognition of the matrix attachment region of DNA by transcription factor SATB1.;Special AT-rich sequence binding protein 1 (SATB1) regulates gene expression essential in immune T-cell maturation and switching of fetal globin species, by binding to matrix attachment regions (MARs) of DNA and inducing a local chromatin remodeling. Previously we have revealed a five-helix structure of the N-terminal CUT domain, which is essentially the folded region in the MAR-binding domain, of human SATB1 by NMR. Here we determined crystal structure of the complex of the CUT domain and a MAR DNA, in which the third helix of the CUT domain deeply enters the major groove of DNA in the B-form. Bases of 5'-CTAATA-3' sequence are contacted by this helix, through direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds and apolar and van der Waals contacts. Mutations at conserved base-contacting residues, Gln402 and Gly403, reduced the DNA-binding activity, which confirmed the importance of the observed interactions involving these residues. A significant number of equivalent contacts are observed also for typically four-helix POU-specific domains of POU-homologous proteins, indicating that these domains share a common framework of the DNA-binding mode, recognizing partially similar DNA sequences. ;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Each money amount was tested in combination with each heroin dose. Subjects responded under a progressive-ratio schedule (PR 50, 100, ..., 2800); the PR value increased independently for each option. Subjective, performance, and physiological effects were also measured during each session. Heroin breakpoint values increased in a dose-related manner, relative to placebo, when $10 or $20 was available. In contrast, only the highest dose produced a heroin breakpoint value that was significantly different from placebo when $40 was available. Heroin also produced dose-related increases in several ratings of drug effect, including ""I feel ..."" ""a good drug effect"", ""high"", ""mellow"", and ""stimulated"". These effects were not significantly affected by the alternative money condition. These results demonstrated: (1) the dose-related reinforcing effects of i.n. heroin in opioid-dependent individuals; (2) that i.n. heroin self-administration can be modified by the availability of an alternative reinforcer (i.e. money); and (3) that self-reported drug effects can be differentiated from drug self-administration.";-;-;-;hard_0
3682;27693231;Mutations in the pH-Sensing G-protein-Coupled Receptor GPR68 Cause Amelogenesis Imperfecta.;Amelogenesis is the process of dental enamel formation, leading to the deposition of the hardest tissue in the human body. This process requires the intricate regulation of ion transport and controlled changes to the pH of the developing enamel matrix. The means by which the enamel organ regulates pH during amelogenesis is largely unknown. We identified rare homozygous variants in GPR68 in three families with amelogenesis imperfecta, a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous group of inherited conditions associated with abnormal enamel formation. Each of these homozygous variants (a large in-frame deletion, a frameshift deletion, and a missense variant) were predicted to result in loss of function. GPR68 encodes a proton-sensing G-protein-coupled receptor with sensitivity in the pH range that occurs in the developing enamel matrix during amelogenesis. Immunohistochemistry of rat mandibles confirmed localization of GPR68 in the enamel organ at all stages of amelogenesis. Our data identify a role for GPR68 as a proton sensor that is required for proper enamel formation.;-;-;-;hard_0

Using a characterized hCRP cDNA probe, we demonstrate that the human CRP gene (CSRP) is present in a single copy and that both mouse and human genomes contain one or more CRP-related genes detected by hybridization at low stringency. Using a panel of human x rodent somatic cell hybrids, the hCRP locus is assigned to chromosome 1. In situ hybridization of 3H-labeled CRP cDNA to human metaphase chromosomes confirms this assignment and permits regional localization to bands 1q24-1q32. A common MspI polymorphism is identified and mapped to intron 4 of the hCRP gene.

3686;15916858;TATA-binding protein in neurodegenerative disease.;TATA binding protein (TBP) is a general transcription factor that plays an important role in initiation of transcription. In recent years evidence has emerged implicating TPB in the molecular mechanism of a number of neurodegenerative diseases. Wild type TBP in humans contains a long polyglutamine stretch ranging in size from 29 to 42. It has been found associated with aggregated proteins in several of the polyglutamine disorders. Expansion in the CAA/CAG composite repeat beyond 42 has been shown to cause a cerebellar ataxia, SCA17. The involvement of such an important housekeeping protein in the disease mechanism suggests a major impact on the functioning of cells. The question remains, does TBP contribute to these diseases through a loss of normal function, likely to be catastrophic to a cell, or the gain of an aberrant function? This review deals with the function of TBP in transcription and cell function. The distribution of the polyglutamine coding allele lengths in TBP of the normal population and in SCA17 is reviewed and an outline is given on the reported cases of SCA17. The role of TBP in other polyglutamine disorders will be addressed as well as its possible role in other neurodegenerative diseases. ;polyglutamine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
3687;26931465;Poly-dipeptides encoded by the C9ORF72 repeats block global protein translation.;The expansion of the GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat in the non-coding region of the Chromosome 9 open-reading frame 72 (C9orf72) gene is the most common genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This genetic alteration leads to the accumulation of five types of poly-dipeptides translated from the GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat. Among these, poly-proline-arginine (poly-PR) and poly-glycine-arginine (poly-GR) peptides are known to be neurotoxic. However, the mechanisms of neurotoxicity associated with these poly-dipeptides are not clear. A proteomics approach identified a number of interacting proteins with poly-PR peptide, including mRNA-binding proteins, ribosomal proteins, translation initiation factors and translation elongation factors. Immunostaining of brain sections from patients with C9orf72 ALS showed that poly-GR was colocalized with a mRNA-binding protein, hnRNPA1. In vitro translation assays showed that poly-PR and poly-GR peptides made insoluble complexes with mRNA, restrained the access of translation factors to mRNA, and blocked protein translation. Our results demonstrate that impaired protein translation mediated by poly-PR and poly-GR peptides plays a role in neurotoxicity and reveal that the pathways altered by the poly-dipeptides-mRNA complexes are potential therapeutic targets for treatment of C9orf72 FTD/ALS. ;polyproline;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
3689;34417622;Formation of artificial chromosomes in Caenorhabditis elegans and analyses of their segregation in mitosis, DNA sequence composition and holocentromere organization.;To investigate how exogenous DNA concatemerizes to form episomal artificial chromosomes (ACs), acquire equal segregation ability and maintain stable holocentromeres, we injected DNA sequences with different features, including sequences that are repetitive or complex, and sequences with different AT-contents, into the gonad of Caenorhabditis elegans to form ACs in embryos, and monitored AC mitotic segregation. We demonstrated that AT-poor sequences (26% AT-content) delayed the acquisition of segregation competency of newly formed ACs. We also co-injected fragmented Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic DNA, differentially expressed fluorescent markers and ubiquitously expressed selectable marker to construct a less repetitive, more complex AC. We sequenced the whole genome of a strain which propagates this AC through multiple generations, and de novo assembled the AC sequences. We discovered CENP-AHCP-3 domains/peaks are distributed along the AC, as in endogenous chromosomes, suggesting a holocentric architecture. We found that CENP-AHCP-3 binds to the unexpressed marker genes and many fragmented yeast sequences, but is excluded in the yeast extremely high-AT-content centromeric and mitochondrial DNA (> 83% AT-content) on the AC. We identified A-rich motifs in CENP-AHCP-3 domains/peaks on the AC and on endogenous chromosomes, which have some similarity with each other and similarity to some non-germline transcription factor binding sites.;polyalanine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
3692;9294454;The chlamydial EUO gene encodes a histone H1-specific protease.;Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular pathogen, long recognized as an agent of blinding eye disease and more recently as a common sexually transmitted infection. Recently, two eukaryotic histone H1-like proteins, designated Hc1 and Hc2, have been identified in Chlamydia. Expression of Hc1 in recombinant Escherichia coli produces chromatin condensation similar to nucleoid condensation observed late in the parasite's own life cycle. In contrast, chromatin decondensation, observed during the early life cycle, accompanies down-regulation and nondetection of Hc1 and Hc2 among internalized organisms. We reasoned that the early upstream open reading frame (EUO) gene product might play a role in Hc1 degradation and nucleoid decondensation since it is expressed very early in the chlamydial life cycle. To explore this possibility, we fused the EUO coding region between amino acids 4 and 177 from C. trachomatis serovar Lz with glutathione S-transferase (GST) and examined the effects of fusion protein on Hc1 in vitro. The purified fusion protein was able to digest Hc1 completely within 1 h at 37 degrees C. However, GST alone exhibited no Hc1-specific proteolytic activity. The chlamydial EUO-GST gene product also cleaves very-lysine-rich calf thymus histone H1 and chicken erythrocyte histone H5 but displays no measurable activity towards core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 or chlamydial RNA polymerase alpha-subunit. This proteolytic activity appears sensitive to the serine protease inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF) and aspartic protease inhibitor pepstatin but resistant to high temperature and other broad-spectrum protease inhibitors. The proteolytic activity specified by the EUO-GST fusion product selectively digested the C-terminal portion of chlamydial Hc1, the domain involved in DNA binding, while leaving the N terminus intact. At a molar equivalent ratio of 1:1 between Hc1 and DNA, the EUO gene product cleaves Hc1 complexed to DNA and this cleavage appears sufficient to initiate dissociation of DNA-Hc1 complexes. However, at a higher molar equivalent ratio of Hc1/DNA (10:1), there is partial protection conferred upon Hc1 to an extent that prevents dissociation of DNA-Hc1 complexes.;polylysine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
3693;26461298;Enhanced proteasome degradation extends Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan and alleviates aggregation-related pathologies.;Collapse of proteostasis and accumulation of damaged macromolecules have been recognized as hallmarks of aging and age-related diseases. The proteasome is the major cellular protease responsible for intracellular protein degradation, having an impaired function during aging. We have previously shown that proteasome activation through overexpression of β5 proteasome subunit delays replicative senescence and confers resistance to oxidative stress in primary fibroblasts. Herein, we have investigated the impact of enhanced proteasome function on organismal longevity and aggregation-related pathologies by employing Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system. We have found that overexpression of a core 20S proteasome subunit in wild type worms extends lifespan, healthspan and survival under proteotoxic conditions. The longevity prolonging effect of the proteasome subunit overexpression was found to depend on the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 and was associated with its elevated transcriptional activity. We have also uncovered a major role of enhanced proteasome activity in aggregation-related pathologies underlying neurodegenerative diseases. Genetic activation of the proteasome minimized the detrimental effect of polyglutamine-induced toxicity mimicking Huntington's disease, whereas knock-down of the proteasome component exaggerated the disease phenotypes. Similar results were obtained by using a C.elegans model of Amyloid beta (Αβ) -induced toxicity mimicking Alzheimer's disease. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that enhanced proteasome function alleviates proteotoxicity and promotes longevity in synergy with other nodes of lifespan regulation in C.elegans. Understanding the mechanism by which preservation of proteostasis via enhancement of proteasome function, decelerates the aging process and alleviates age-related pathologies may assist in the rational design of therapeutic and anti-aging interventions.  ;polyglutamine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
3697;8164514;Distribution of alpha 2-adrenergic receptor subtype gene expression in rat brain.;alpha 2-Adrenergic receptors in brain are important presynaptic modulators of central noradrenergic function (autoreceptors) and postsynaptic mediators of many of the widespread effects of catecholamines and related drugs. alpha 2-Adrenergic agonists are currently used as antihypertensives and preanesthetic agents, but new subtype-selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists have additional therapeutic application potential. Three genes encoding specific alpha 2-adrenoceptor subtypes (alpha 2A, alpha 2B, and alpha 2C) have been isolated and characterized. RNA blotting indicates that all three are expressed in rat brain. This study used in situ hybridization with 35S-labeled RNA probes to map the distribution of alpha 2-adrenoceptor subtype gene expression in rat brain. alpha 2A mRNA was most abundant in the locus coeruleus, but was also widely distributed in the brain stem, cerebral cortex, septum, hypothalamus, hippocampus and amygdala. alpha 2B mRNA was observed only in the thalamus. alpha 2C mRNA was mainly localized to the basal ganglia, olfactory tubercle, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex. These mRNA distributions largely agree with previous findings on the alpha 2-adrenoceptor distributions in the rat brain, but suggest that the localization patterns for each receptor subtype are unique. The expression of alpha 2A mRNA in noradrenergic neurons indicates that this subtype mediates presynaptic autoreceptor functions. Furthermore, the localization of alpha 2A mRNA in noradrenergic projection areas suggests that this receptor may also have an important role in mediating postsynaptic effects. The precise physiological and pharmacological roles of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor subtypes are still largely unknown, but it is expected that in situ hybridization coupled to various methods to identify the transmitter phenotypes of the subtype-expressing neurons will help to clarify these important issues in the near future.;-;-;-;hard_0

Binding of Ag III to hydroxyapatite was inhibited by pretreatment with, or in the presence of, saliva. Various aminohexoses, and also tris, inhibited the binding of Ag I/II. When Ags I/II and III were tested for their ability to bind to salivary components separated by SDS gel electrophoresis, several proteins capable of binding Ag I/II were identified, notably 2 proteins of apparent relative molecular mass 28,000 and 38,000.

3699;6099398;Minimal size plasmids containing an M13 origin for production of single-strand transducing particles.;We have studied the requirements for efficient production of single-strand transducing particles from minimal size plasmids containing the phage M13 origin of replication. The most favorable origin fragment for production of transducing particles was found to extend from nucleotides 5372 to 5943 of the phage sequence, which includes a segment of the phage gene IV coding region and eliminates part of the gene II promoter. Minimizing vector size for M13 origin plasmids appears to be beneficial since transducing particle titer decreases with increasing plasmid size. A mutant helper phage was isolated and shown to improve the production of transducing particles from small plasmids, but to outcompete plasmids bearing large inserts. Several plasmid vectors which produce high yields of single-strand transducing particles and good ratios of transducing particles to helper phage have been constructed.;-;-;-;hard_0

Cerebral metastases were detected in 19 patients. Meningiomas were found in three patients, one with neurological symptoms and two without. Typical metastases less than 10 mm in diameter were located superficially in the grey matter, regular, homogenous, hyperdense, with no edema. Extensive peripheral edema was often associated with metastases measuring more than 10 mm. CCT revealed cerebral metastases in 6 (13%) of 46 asymptomatic patients. The metastases measured less than 10 mm in four and less than 20 mm in two of these patients. Scintigraphy was falsely negative in six patients with metastases smaller than 10 mm. Therefore, CCT is the method of choice for screening asymptomatic patients. Angiography may be of value in the differentiation between meningioma and melanoma metastases.;-;-;-;hard_0

To investigate the effect of cutaneous application area on oestradiol absorption using an oestradiol gel for transdermal use. Furthermore, the effect of washing of the application site on oestradiol pharmacokinetics was studied.


DESIGN
Open-label, randomised, three-way cross-over study.


SETTING
A clinical pharmacokinetic research unit.


SUBJECTS
Sixteen healthy postmenopausal volunteers.


INTERVENTIONS
During three treatment periods, subjects were treated with 1 mg oestradiol (1.0 g Divigel/Sandrena 0.1% gel), applied on the thigh to a skin area of 200 cm2, 400 cm2, or on an area 'as large as possible'. Blood samples were drawn during steady-state (on days 14-15) immediately before application and at regular time intervals thereafter.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Serum oestradiol levels were measured for determination of peak concentration (Cmax), time to peak concentration (tmax) and bioavailability using the area under the time concentration curve (AUC0-24).


RESULTS
Bioavailability from a 200 cm2 area was 2-fold higher than that from the largest possible area (P < 0.05). Oestradiol peak plasma concentration from a 200 cm2 area was higher than from the two larger areas (P < 0.05), which did not differ significantly from each other. Washing of the application site 30 min after application reduced the bioavailability from both the 200 cm2 and 400 cm2 application areas (P < 0.01), but peak plasma concentration from the 200 cm2 area only (P < 0.01). Time to reach peak plasma concentrations was significantly reduced with all three application areas by washing.


CONCLUSION
A higher oestradiol absorption was achieved from a smaller application area. No marked differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics between 200 cm2 and 400 cm2 application areas, which are those recommended for this oestradiol gel preparation.";-;-;-;hard_0

It was the goal to assess the crossreactivity of the major everolimus metabolites in the blood of patients undergoing kidney graft with the Innofluor Certican Assay (Seradyn, Inc., Indianapolis, IN), a clinical assay used to quantify the concentrations of everolimus in patients' blood samples. The three main hydroxy metabolites of everolimus (46-, 24-, and 25-hydroxy everolimus) and all other minor hydroxylated and demethylated metabolites were generated using pooled human liver microsomes and purified using semipreparative high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. Structures were confirmed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/ion trap mass spectrometry and analysis of the fragmentation patterns. Blank blood samples were spiked with the isolated metabolites to determine the specific crossreactivity with the immunoassay. Crossreactivity testing with the immunoassay showed 1% or less for 46-hydroxy and 24-hydroxy everolimus and 6% or less crossreactivity for 25-hydroxy everolimus at therapeutically relevant concentrations. Crossreactivity testing of the minor metabolites showed crossreactivities of 16.3% for 45-hydroxy, 33.0% for 12-hydroxy, 18.3% for 11-hydroxy, 15.3% for 14-hydroxy, 38.7% for OH-piperidine I, 46.3% for OH-piperidine II, 43% for 39-O-desmethyl, 142% for 27-O-desmethyl, and 68% for 40-O-desethylhydroxy everolimus (sirolimus).;-;-;-;hard_0
3708;1379284;Suppression of macrophage Ia antigen expression by endogenous interferon-alpha/beta.;Exogenous interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and interferon-beta (IFN-beta) (type I IFNs) are known to suppress the IFN-gamma-dependent expression of class II MHC (Ia) antigens on macrophages (M phi). We report here that the endogenous type I IFNs produced by M phi in response to IFN inducers regulate Ia expression of the M phi themselves. Coculture of M phi with IFN-gamma and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I):poly(C)] resulted in the reduction of Ia expression in comparison with those cultured without poly(I):poly(C). Pretreatment of M phi with poly(I):poly(C) or a bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is also a potent IFN inducer, in vitro or in vivo, before being exposed to IFN-gamma was also effective in suppressing the Ia expression. Such suppression was abolished by the addition of anti-IFN-alpha/beta antibodies to the M phi culture along with IFN-gamma. M phi cultured with L-cell conditioned medium (LCM) containing M-CSF were less capable of expressing Ia antigens than those cultured without LCM. The Ia-expressing ability of LCM-treated M phi was also restored by the addition of anti-IFN-alpha/beta antibodies. M phi in the early stage of sterile inflammation were less responsive to IFN-gamma than those in the late stage. These results suggest that endogenous type I IFNs, which are produced in response to natural or synthetic IFN-inducers, regulate M phi Ia expression in an autocrinal manner. ;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

3715;9285100;Interaction of eukaryotic initiation factor 5A with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Rev response element RNA and U6 snRNA requires deoxyhypusine or hypusine modification.;Hypusine formation on the eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A) precursor represents a unique posttranslational modification that is ubiquitously present in eukaryotic cells and archaebacteria. Specific inhibition of deoxyhypusine synthase leads to growth arrest and cell death. The precise cellular function of eIF-5A and the physiological significance of hypusine modification are not clear. Although the methionyl-puromycin synthesis has been suggested to be the functional assay for eIF-5A activity in vitro, the role of eIF-5A in protein synthesis has not been established. Recent studies have suggested that eIF-5A may be the cellular target of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Rev and human T cell leukemia virus type 1 Rex proteins. Motif analysis suggested that eIF-5A resembles a bimodular RNA-binding protein in that it contains a stretch of basic amino acids clustered at the N-terminal region and a leucine-rich stretch at the C-terminal region. Using Rev target RNA, RRE, as a model, we tested the hypothesis that eIF-5A may be an RNA-binding protein. We found that both deoxyhypusine and hypusine-containing eIF-5A can bind to the 252-nt RRE RNA, as determined by a gel mobility shift assay. In contrast, the unmodified eIF-5A precursor cannot. Deoxyhypusine-containing eIF-5A, but not its precursor, could also cause supershift of the Rev stem-loop IIB RRE complex. Preliminary studies also indicated that eIF-5A can bind to RNA such as U6 snRNA and that deoxyhypusine modification appears to be required for the binding. The ability of eIF-5A to directly interact with RNA suggests that deoxyhypusine formation of eIF-5A may be related to its role in RNA processing and protein synthesis. Our study also suggests the possibility of using a gel mobility shift assay for eIF-5A-RNA binding as a functional assay for deoxyhypusine and hypusine formation.; polyleucine ;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
3716;31748571;Truncated TALE-FP as DNA Staining Dye in a High-salt Buffer.;Large DNA molecules are a promising platform for in vitro single-molecule biochemical analysis to investigate DNA-protein interactions by fluorescence microscopy. For many studies, intercalating fluorescent dyes have been primary DNA staining reagents, but they often cause photo-induced DNA breakage as well as structural deformation. As a solution, we previously developed several fluorescent-protein DNA-binding peptides or proteins (FP-DBP) for reversibly staining DNA molecules without structural deformation or photo-induced damage. However, they cannot stain DNA in a condition similar to a physiological salt concentration that most biochemical reactions require. Given these concerns, here we developed a salt-tolerant FP-DBP: truncated transcription activator-like effector (tTALE-FP), which can stain DNA up to 100 mM NaCl. Moreover, we found an interesting phenomenon that the tTALE-FP stained DNA evenly in 1 × TE buffer but showed AT-rich specific patterns from 40 mM to 100 mM NaCl. Using an assay based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we demonstrated that this binding pattern is caused by a higher DNA binding affinity of tTALE-FP for AT-rich compared to GC-rich regions. Finally, we used tTALE-FP in a single molecule fluorescence assay to monitor real-time restriction enzyme digestion of single DNA molecules. Altogether, our results demonstrate that this protein can provide a useful alternative as a DNA stain over intercalators. ;polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Plasma T3 concentration was positively associated with toenail selenium in cases (age-adjusted regression coefficient = 0.049) and controls (age-adjusted regression coefficient = 0.036). Toenail selenium concentrations tended to be lower in cases than in controls, but the differences did not reach statistical significance. Although the disease process per se may explain the lower plasma T3 concentrations, it is also possible, inasmuch as these patients were in early-stage breast cancer, that selenium status may be influencing T3 levels via changes in the activity of the selenoenzyme type 1 iodothyronine deiodinase.;-;-;-;hard_0
3725;2521242;Cloning and characterization of a cDNA for a new mouse T cell growth factor (P40).;Recently, we described a murine helper T cell-derived molecule with T cell growth factor activity that is functionally and structurally distinct from IL-2, IL-4, and other known growth factors. This molecule, designated P40, was identified as a glycoprotein capable of supporting antigen-independent growth of certain helper T cell clones. Here, we report the cloning and expression of a cDNA for this new growth factor. The predicted mature protein is a cationic cysteine-rich polypeptide of 14 kD without significant homology to previously sequenced proteins.;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
3726;8709224;Epstein-Barr virus nuclear protein 2 (EBNA2) binds to a component of the human SNF-SWI complex, hSNF5/Ini1.;Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2), one of the six viral nuclear proteins expressed in latently infected B lymphocytes, is essential to the immortalization of B cells by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBNA2 promotes transcriptional transactivation of viral and cellular genes by acting as an adapter molecule that binds to cellular sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, JK recombination signal-binding protein (RBP-JK), and PU.1 and engages multiple members of the RNA polymerase II transcription complex. In the present study, we show that EBNA2 also interacts with hSNF5/Ini1, the human homolog of the yeast transcription factor SNF5. Gel filtration fractionation of partially purified EBV-positive lymphocyte nuclear extracts shows that a fraction of EBNA2 coelutes with both hSNF5/Ini1 and BRG1, a human homolog of SWI/SNF2, in the high-molecular-mass region (1.5 to 2.0 MDa) of a Superose 6 chromatogram. An affinity-purified rabbit antibody directed against hSNF5/Ini1 coimmunoprecipitates EBNA2 from this high-molecular-mass nuclear protein fraction, demonstrating that EBNA2 and hSNF5/Ini1 interact in vivo. This interaction is restricted to a subpopulation of phosphorylated viral EBNA2. Deletion mutation analysis of EBNA2 shows that the proline-rich aminoterminal end and a domain within the divergent region of EBNA2 mediate EBNA2-hSNF5/Ini1 interaction. Since the SNF-SWI complex participates in gene regulation through the alteration of nucleosome configuration and may be a component of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme, the EBNA2-hSNF5/Ini1 interaction supports the hypothesis that EBNA2 facilitates transcriptional transactivation by acting as a transcription adapter molecule. We postulate that EBNA2 engages the hSNF-SWI complex to generate an open chromatin conformation at the EBNA2-responsive target genes, thereby potentiating the function of the RBP-JK-EBNA2-polymerase II transcription complex. ;polyproline;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
3729;8752089;Mammalian splicing factor SF1 is encoded by variant cDNAs and binds to RNA.;Mammalian splicing factor SF1 consists of a single polypeptide of 75 kDa and is required for the formation of the first ATP-dependent spliceosomal complex. Three cDNAs encoding variant forms of SF1 have been isolated and four highly related cDNAs have been found in current databases. Comparison of the cDNA sequences suggests that different SF1 mRNAs are generated by alternative splicing of a common pre-mRNA. In agreement with this idea, at least three mRNAs that are differentially expressed in different cell types have been detected by northern blot analysis. All SF1 cDNAs identified encode proteins with a common N-terminal half that contains two structural motifs implicated in RNA binding (an hnRNP K homology [KH] domain and a zinc knuckle), but the proteins differ in the length of a proline-rich region and have distinct C-termini. Three SF1 isoforms expressed in insect cells via baculovirus transfer vectors show comparable activities in the assembly of a pre-splicing complex. Consistent with the presence of a KH domain and a zinc knuckle, we show that SF1 binds directly to RNA. This interaction appears to be largely sequence-independent with a preference for guanosine- and uridine-rich sequences. The KH domain of SF1 is embedded in a 160-amino acid sequence that is shared with human Sam68, a target of Src during mitosis, as well as Caenorhabditis elegans GLD-1 and mouse Qkl, both of which play roles during cellular differentiation. The presence of this shared region in SF1 suggests functions in addition to its role in pre-spliceosome assembly. ;polyproline;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
3730;1653174;Maturation-specific polyadenylation: in vitro activation by p34cdc2 and phosphorylation of a 58-kD CPE-binding protein.;"During Xenopus oocyte maturation, poly(A) elongation controls the translational recruitment of specific mRNAs that possess a CPE (cytoplasmic polyadenylation element). To investigate the activation of polyadenylation, we have employed oocyte extracts that are not normally competent for polyadenylation. Addition of cell lysates containing baculovirus-expressed cyclin to these extracts induces the polyadenylation of exogenous B4 RNA. The involvement of p34cdc2 kinase in cyclin-mediated polyadenylation was demonstrated by p13-Sepharose depletion; removal of the kinase from oocyte extracts with this affinity matrix abolishes polyadenylation activation. Reintroduction of cell lysates containing baculovirus-expressed p34cdc2, however, completely restores this activity. To identify factors of the polyadenylation apparatus that might be responsible for the activation, we employed UV cross-linking and identified a 58-kD protein that binds the B4 CPE in oocyte extracts. In polyadenylation-proficient egg extracts, this protein has a slower electrophoretic mobility, which suggests a post-translational modification. A similar size shift of the protein is evident in oocyte extracts supplemented with lysates containing baculovirus-expressed cyclin and p34cdc2. This size shift, which is reversed by treatment with acid phosphatase, coincides temporally with cyclin-induced polyadenylation activation. We propose that p34cdc2 kinase activity leads to the phosphorylation of the 58-kD CPE-binding protein and that this event is crucial for the cytoplasmic polyadenylation that occurs during oocyte maturation."; polyalanine ;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function

Two groups of mice served as controls. One group was sham immunized intranasally with mock-infected HeLa 229 cell extracts and was challenged in the ovarian bursa with C. trachomatis MoPn (sham immunized, C. trachomatis challenged). The second control group was sham immunized and not challenged (sham immunized, nonchallenged). Before challenge, the C. trachomatis-immunized, C. trachomatis-challenged animals mounted a significant humoral response as shown by high immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, and IgA levels and high levels of neutralizing antibodies in serum and moderate IgG and IgA titers in vaginal secretions. Reactivity by Western blot (immunoblot) to the lipopolysaccharide, 30-, 40- (major outer membrane protein), and 60-kDa cysteine-rich proteins and 75- and 100-kDa chlamydial components could be demonstrated. However, reactivity to the 60-kDa heat shock protein was only observed 22 days after challenge. In addition, this group of animals mounted a significant immune response to chlamydial antigens, as shown by a lymphocyte proliferation assay, compared with the sham-immunized nonchallenged mice. After intrabursal challenge, there was no C. trachomatis shedding from the vagina in the C. trachomatis-immunized, C. trachomatis-challenged animals, while 63% of the sham-immunized, C. trachomatis-challenged mice had a positive C. trachomatis culture. In addition, histological sections from the genital tract showed, at 2 weeks postchallenge, a marked acute inflammatory reaction in the sham-immunized, C. trachomatis-challenged animals while in the C. trachomatis-immunized, C. trachomatis-challenged mice there was minimal inflammatory reaction. When the animals were mated, only 12% of the mice from the sham-immunized, C. trachomatis-challenged mice were fertile. In contrast, 94 and 80% of the sham-immunized, nonchallenged and C. trachomatis-immunized, C. trachomatis-challenged mice, respectively, were fertile.;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
3733;8871567;Cloning and characterization of the genomic DNA of the human MSSP genes.;MSSP proteins have been identified by their binding to an upstream element of c-myc. Independently, two different approaches yielded two cDNA clones highly homologous to the MSSP cDNAs, suggesting an involvement of MSSP in the regulation of the cell cycle (scr2) and in the repression of HIV-1 and ILR2 alpha-promoter transcription (human YC1). Screening human genomic libraries, we have isolated clones belonging to two different gene loci. Whereas the human MSSP gene 1 turned out to be intronless, the organization of the coding sequence within gene 2 is more complex. It spans more than 60 kb and contains 16 exons (including two alternative first exons), ranging from 48 to 287 bp, respectively. The intron sizes vary from 0.1 to more than 13 kb. Gene 1 has been completely sequenced. A deletion series of its upstream region was conjugated to the luciferase gene, but the transfection of the constructs did not display any promoter activity. Moreover, compared with gene 2 and the cDNA sequences known so far, about 20 point mutations as well as flanking direct repeats have been detected in the MSSP gene 1, showing that it possesses all the characteristics of processed retropseudogenes. Sequence analysis of a 1.7 kb fragment of the 5' flanking region of the MSSP gene 2 revealed that the promoter of gene 2 lacks consensus sequences for TATA and CCAAT boxes, is GC-rich, and contains numerous potential transcription factor binding elements including an Sp1 binding site. DNase I footprinting experiments showed that the putative Sp1 site was bound by proteins. The results of primer extension and S1 mapping analyses suggested the transcription of the gene starts at multiple positions upstream from the initiator methionine codon. Luciferase assays employing progressive deletions of the 1.7 kb promoter region allowed us to define the minimal promoter region of 428 bp (-488/+) and revealed a complex pattern of the transcriptional regulation the human MSSP gene 2. Furthermore, it can be concluded that the MSSP gene 2 encodes both MSSP-1 and MSSP-2, and moreover scr2 and human YC1.;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
3734;2556263;'SPKK' motifs prefer to bind to DNA at A/T-rich sites.;The termini of histone H1 and sea urchin spermatogenous H1 and H2B, which are essential for correct chromatin condensation, often contain repeats of the sequence SPK(R)K(R). A special type of beta-turn structural motif has been proposed for this sequence, and it has been shown that a segment of the sea urchin sperm H1 N terminus, which has six repeats of the motif (S6 peptide), binds to DNA and competes with the DNA binding drug Hoechst 33258. Here, we demonstrate by quantitative analysis of hydroxyl radical footprints that the synthetic oligopeptide, SPRKSPRK (S2), and the S6 peptide prefer to bind to the minor groove of DNA at the same A/T-rich sites. The locations of these binding sites are similar to Hoechst, but the sequence specificity of the oligopeptides is lower than that of Hoechst, and the detailed protection patterns differ slightly. We suggest that these small peptides and Hoechst recognize similar sequence-dependent features of the local architecture of DNA. ;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
3735;17295916;Toll like receptor-3 ligand poly-ICLC promotes the efficacy of peripheral vaccinations with tumor antigen-derived peptide epitopes in murine CNS tumor models.;Toll-like receptor (TLR)3 ligands serve as natural inducers of pro-inflammatory cytokines capable of promoting Type-1 adaptive immunity, and TLR3 is abundantly expressed by cells within the central nervous system (CNS). To improve the efficacy of vaccine strategies directed against CNS tumors, we evaluated whether administration of a TLR3 ligand, polyinosinic-polycytidylic (poly-IC) stabilized with poly-lysine and carboxymethylcellulose (poly-ICLC) would enhance the anti-CNS tumor effectiveness of tumor peptide-based vaccinations. C57BL/6 mice bearing syngeneic CNS GL261 glioma or M05 melanoma received subcutaneous (s.c.) vaccinations with synthetic peptides encoding CTL epitopes--mEphA2 (671-679), hgp100 (25-33) and mTRP-2 (180-188) for GL261, or ovalbumin (OVA: 257-264) for M05. The mice also received intramuscular (i.m.) injections with poly-ICLC. The combination of subcutaneous (s.c.) peptide-based vaccination and i.m. poly-ICLC administration promoted systemic induction of antigen (Ag)-specific Type-1 CTLs expressing very late activation antigen (VLA)-4, which confers efficient CNS-tumor homing of vaccine-induced CTLs based on experiments with monoclonal antibody (mAb)-mediated blockade of VLA-4. In addition, the combination treatment allowed expression of IFN-gamma by CNS tumor-infiltrating CTLs, and improved the survival of tumor bearing mice in the absence of detectable autoimmunity. These data suggest that poly-ICLC, which has been previously evaluated in clinical trials, can be effectively combined with tumor Ag-specific vaccine strategies, thereby providing a greater index of therapeutic efficacy. ;polylysine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
3737;34583974;SATB1-dependent mitochondrial ROS production controls TCR signaling in CD4 T cells.;"Special AT-rich sequence binding protein-1 (SATB1) is localized to the nucleus and remodels chromatin structure in T cells. SATB1-deficient CD4 T cells cannot respond to TCR stimulation; however, the cause of this unresponsiveness is to be clarified. Here, we demonstrate that SATB1 is indispensable to proper mitochondrial functioning and necessary for the activation of signal cascades via the TCR in CD4 T cells. Naïve SATB1-deficient CD4 T cells contain fewer mitochondria than WT T cells, as the former do not express mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). Impaired mitochondrial function in SATB1-deficient T cells subverts mitochondrial ROS production and SHP-1 inactivation by constitutive oxidization. Ectopic TFAM expression increases mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial ROS production and rescues defects in the antigen-specific response in the SATB1-deficient T cells. Thus, SATB1 is vital for maintaining mitochondrial mass and function by regulating TFAM expression, which is necessary for TCR signaling.";polythreonine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
3740;8454022;Plasmodium falciparum: the immune response in rabbits to the clustered asparagine-rich protein (CARP) after immunization in Freund's adjuvant or immunostimulating complexes (ISCOMs).;The Plasmodium falciparum clustered asparagine-rich protein (CARP) is a merozoite-associated antigen which contains approximately 30% asparagine. Analysis of the DNA sequences located 5' of the cloned 1.4-kb CARP gene in the P. falciparum genome suggests that this gene fragment may encode the complete CARP and that the gene product is a protein of M(r) 50,000. To analyze the immunogenicity of CARP, the gene was expressed as a fusion protein with staphylococcal protein A (SpA-CARP). Immunization of rabbits with SpA-CARP in Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA) resulted in a strong antibody response against CARP as measured in ELISA. This response was efficiently boosted and sustained over a long time while that induced by two immunizations with SpA-CARP in ISCOMs was weak and of shorter duration. In both instances, the antibody levels against CARP were further increased by a second booster injection consisting of either SpA-CARP or CARP fused to the serum albumin-binding region (BB) of streptococcal protein G (BB-CARP) in PBS, indicating that immunizations with SpA-CARP in FCA or ISCOMs had induced a CARP-specific immunological memory. Boosting with BB-CARP in PBS was more efficient than boosting with SpA-CARP in PBS. In all rabbits, the antibodies obtained after the booster with CARP in PBS were the most efficient inhibitors of merozoite invasion in vitro. The antisera reacted with the intracellular parasite in immunofluorescence and with a band of M(r) 50,000 in immunoblotting while several high-molecular-weight components as well as the one of M(r) 50,000 were immunoprecipitated. The specificity of the antibody responses varied between the different rabbits as indicated in ELISA, with short synthetic peptides representing different CARP sequences. Taken together, the results suggest that a previously cloned genomic DNA fragment may encode the complete P. falciparum blood-stage antigen CARP and that CARP is immunogenic in rabbits both when administered in FCA or ISCOMs.;polyasparagine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

All animals were restrained with darts containing 10 mg/kg ketamine and 1 mg/kg xylazine.

Cortisol was determined using a solid phase radioimmunoassay with an intra-assay coefficient of 8.51%. Data were analyzed statistically by the Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by Dunn's multiple comparisons test, and the one-sample t-test, with the level of significance set at P < 0.05.

3745;18529062;Pyridone dipeptide backbone scan to elucidate structural properties of a flexible peptide segment.;Whereas the C-terminal fragment of neuropeptide Y (NPY) has been structurally well-defined both in solution and as membrane-bound, detailed structural information regarding the proline-rich N-terminus is still missing. The systematic variation of each position by a conformationally constrained pyridone dipeptide building block within the amino terminal segment of NPY leads to a systematic receptor subtype selectivity of the neuropeptide. Thereby, the systematic dipeptide scan proved superior to the traditional L-Ala scan because it showed how to modify the N-terminus in order to obtain increasingly more Y1 or Y5 receptor selective ligands. NMR and CD spectroscopic analyses were used to characterize the stepwise rigidification of the N-terminus of NPY when up to three dipeptide building blocks were incorporated by solid-phase peptide synthesis. The pyridone dipeptide increases the hydrophobicity of the amino terminus of NPY, and this allows the tuning of the membrane affinity of NPY. The amphiphilic C-terminal helix of 3-fold-substituted NPY thus becomes visible by selective line broadening in the (1)H NMR. Accordingly, we could structurally characterize protein segments that are too flexible for other methods. ;polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function

The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of endogenous and exogenous the PPAR-alpha ligand on the development of lung injury caused by bleomycin administration. Lung injury was induced in PPAR-alpha wild-type (WT) mice and PPAR-alpha knockout (KO) mice by intratracheal administration of bleomycin. An increase of immunoreactivity to poly-ADP-ribose, TNF-alpha, and IL-1 beta, as well as a significant loss of body weight and mortality was observed in the lung of bleomycin-treated PPAR-alpha WT mice. The absence of a functional PPAR-alpha gene in PPAR-alpha KO mice resulted in a significant augmentation of all the above-described parameters. On the contrary, the treatment of PPAR-alpha WT with WY-14643 (1 mg/kg daily) significantly reduced the degree of lung injury, the rise in myeloperoxidase activity, and the increase in staining (immunohistochemistry) for poly-ADP-ribose, TNF-alpha, and IL-1 beta caused by bleomycin administration. Thus, endogenous and exogenous PPAR-alpha ligands reduce the degree of lung injury induced by bleomycin in the mice. Therefore, we propose that the PPAR-alpha ligand may be useful in the treatment of lung injury. ;polyalanine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
3754;25284180;The identification of the first molluscan Akirin2 with immune defense function in the Hong Kong oyster Crassostrea hongkongensis.;The Akirin protein is a nuclear factor in the innate immune system that is highly conserved from insects to mammals and plays key roles in diverse biological processes, including immunity, myogenesis, development and the cellular stress response. However, the function of Akirins in mollusk, the second most diverse group of animals, is still poorly understood. In this study, we report the discovery of an Akirin2 gene homolog (ChAkirin2) and its biological functions in the Hong Kong oyster Crassostrea hongkongensis. ChAkirin2 is 189 amino acids in length and shares significant homology with invertebrate homologs. Phylogenetic analysis results revealed that ChAkirin2 is clustered with invertebrate Akirin2s. A sequence analysis of the 5' flanking regions of ChAkirin2 indicated that it harbors several potential PAMP-activated transcription factor binding sites (TFB), including sites for NF-κB, C/EBPα, AP-1, SRF, Oct-1 and GATA-1. An RT-PCR analysis showed that ChAkirin2 mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in various tissues and at different embryonic and larval stages. Additionally, upon infection by pathogens (Vibrio alginolyticus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs: LPS, PGN and polyI:C), the expression of ChAkirin2 was significantly up-regulated. Moreover, fluorescence microscopy observations show that ChAkirin2 is located in the nuclei of HeLa cells, and the overexpression of ChAkirin2 activated the transcriptional activities of the NF-κB reporter gene in HEK293T cells. Altogether, this report provided the first experimental demonstration that mollusks possess a functional Akirin2 that is involved in the innate defense and embryogenesis processes of the oyster.  ;polyisoleucine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
3756;7965081;Comparison of innervation and agrin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.;Studies of the regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation at the neuromuscular junction during development and following denervation suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is regulated by neuronal innervation of muscle. The finding that agrin, a neuronally derived extracellular matrix protein also induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the nicotinic receptor, suggests that nerve-induced tyrosine phosphorylation may be mediated by agrin. To study this further, we have examined the regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of the nicotinic receptor by innervation in vitro using muscle-neuron cocultures. Innervation of chick myotubes by chick ciliary ganglia neurons induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the nicotinic receptor with the same subunit specificity seen with bath applied purified agrin. Both innervation and agrin-induced phosphorylation of the nicotinic receptor resulted in an increase in tyrosine and serine phosphorylation. In addition, thermolysin phosphopeptide maps of the subunits after innervation or agrin-treatment were identical. The similarity in the agrin- and nerve-induced phosphorylation of the acetylcholine receptor suggests that agrin mediates the nerve-induced phosphorylation during development in vivo and that phosphorylation of the acetylcholine receptor may play an important role in the development of the neuromuscular junction.;-;-;-;hard_0

The establishment of a direct enteral feeding route is critical in the overall treatment of many patients with head and neck cancer. Use of radiologic percutaneous gastrostomy (RPG), the newest technique for gaining enteral access, has not been studied in such patients extensively. This study evaluated the indications, technique, success rate, and complications associated with RPG in patients with head and neck cancer.


STUDY DESIGN
Retrospective.


METHODS
A comprehensive chart review was undertaken of 56 patients with head and neck cancer treated at a tertiary care institution who had undergone successful or attempted RPG at some point during their treatment course.


RESULTS
Most study patients had advanced oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. The most frequent indications for RPG were dysphagia/aspiration following tumor resection (n = 26) and dysphagia following completion of single- or combined-modality therapy (n = 22). The success rate of attempted RPGs was 98.2%. The overall complication rate for RPG was 12.7% (10.9% minor and 1.8% major).


CONCLUSIONS
RPG is a valuable tool for establishing enteral nutrition in patients with head and neck cancer. Advantages of RPG include high success rate despite obstructing lesions, low complication rate, time efficiency and scheduling ease compared with intraoperative percutaneous gastrostomy (PEG) by a second team, no reported tumor seeding of the tube site, and the fact that postoperative RPG allows for more accurate selection of patients who require a gastrostomy tube.";-;-;-;hard_0
3762;23907094;Androgen receptor activation by polychlorinated biphenyls: epigenetic effects mediated by the histone demethylase Jarid1b.;The exposure to environmental endocrine disrupting compounds (EDC), as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), widely diffused in the environment may produce epigenetic changes that affect the endocrine system. We found that PCBs activate AR transcriptional activity and that this effect is potentiated by the demethylase Jarid1b, a histone demethylase that catalyzes the removal of trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3), induced by PCB. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of the treatment of cultured cells (HEK293) with a mixture of the most diffused environmental PCBs and, also with dihydrotestosterone (DHT), on the functional interaction between AR and Jarid1b. Although the effect induced by DHT on the AR transactivation was considerably higher, the PCB mixture produced an AR-mediated transactivation in a dose-dependent manner. Cotransfection with plasmids expressing Jarid1b and various AR isoforms containing polyglutamine tracts (polyQ tracts) of different lengths showed that Jarid1b potentiates the AR transcriptional activity induced by PCBs but only with the shortest AR isoform. The potentiating effect of Jarid1b on the AR is mediated by a direct interaction of the enzyme with the AR promoter. In fact, utilizing constructs containing AR promoters with a different length and a luciferase reporter gene, we showed that the effect of PCBs, but not of DHT, needs the presence of Jarid1b and of at least two DNA binding sites for Jarid1b.  ;polyglutamine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
3771;8988856;PR-39, a proline-rich peptide antibiotic from pig, and FALL-39, a tentative human counterpart.;The peptide antibiotic PR-39 was originally isolated from the upper part of pig intestine. It has antibacterial activity against Gram negative bacteria at concentrations comparable with tetracycline. Studies of the mechanism of action showed that PR-39 inhibits both DNA and protein synthesis. Recently, PR-39 was found in wound fluid and was shown to have inductive activity on matrix components as part of the wound repair process. We have now sequenced the complete gene and possible mediators of its expression will be discussed. Our attempts to characterize the human counterpart of PR-39 by probing for the well conserved prepro-part led to a different peptide antibiotic. A clone containing the coding information for this new peptide was isolated from a human bone marrow cDNA library. The putative human peptide antibiotic was designated FALL-39 after the first four residues and the total number of residues. All human peptide antibiotics previously isolated (or predicted) belong to the defensin family with three disulfide bridges, while FALL-39 lacks cysteine. The clone for the prepro-FALL-39 encodes a cathelin-like precursor protein with 170 amino acid residues. We have postulated a dibasic processing site for the mature FALL-39 and chemically synthesized the peptide. In the presence of the basal medium E, synthetic FALL-39 was highly active against Escherichia coli D21 and Bacillus megaterium Bm11. Residues 13-34 in FALL-39 can be predicted to form a perfect amphipatic helix and CD spectra showed that medium E induced 30% helix formation in FALL-39. By Northern blot analyses the transcript was located in bone marrow and testis. The structure of the gene and the chromosomal location is under investigation.;polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function
3777;27864382;Molecular dynamics of Dkk4 modulates Wnt action and regulates meibomian gland development.;Secreted Dickkopf (Dkk) proteins are major Wnt pathway modulators during organ development. Dkk1 has been widely studied and acts as a general Wnt inhibitor. However, the molecular function of other Dkks remains largely unknown. Here, we show that Dkk4 selectively inhibits a subset of Wnts, but is further inactivated by proteolytic cleavage. Meibomian gland (MG) formation is employed as a model where Dkk4 and its Wnt targets are expressed. Skin-specific expression of Dkk4 arrests MG growth at early germ phase, which is similar to that observed in Eda-ablated Tabby mice. Consistent with transient Dkk4 action, intact Dkk4 inhibits MG extension but the cleaved form progressively increases during MG development with a concomitant upswing in Wnt activity. Furthermore, both Dkk4 and its receptor (and Wnt co-receptor) Lrp6 are direct Eda targets during MG induction. In cell and organotypic cultures, Dkk4 inhibition is eliminated by elevation of Lrp6. Also, Lrp6 upregulation restores MG formation in Tabby mice. Thus, the dynamic state of Dkk4 itself and its interaction with Lrp6 modulates Wnt function during MG development, with a novel limitation of Dkk4 action by proteolytic cleavage.;-;-;-;hard_0
3778;9769819;Takayasu arteritis: evaluation of the thoracic aorta with CT angiography.;"PURPOSE
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of computed tomographic (CT) angiography in the evaluation of Takayasu arteritis.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Twenty-five patients with clinical symptoms suggestive of Takayasu arteritis underwent CT angiography and conventional angiography. Takayasu arteritis was diagnosed in 20 patients on the basis of conventional angiography. CT angiography was performed with a helical CT scanner after injection of a bolus of contrast material, and images were generated for three-dimensional display, multiplanar reformation, and maximum intensity projection. For vascular assessment, all images from CT angiography were used, and the results were compared with those from conventional angiography.


RESULTS
CT angiography clearly depicted various luminal changes, including stenosis, occlusion, dilatation, and aneurysm, in the thoracic aorta and its major branches. CT angiography accurately depicted 190 (95%) of 200 arteries, although the extent of the steno-occlusive lesions was overestimated in five (2%) and underestimated in five (2%). Furthermore, CT angiography depicted mural changes, including wall thickening, calcification, and mural thrombi, not seen with conventional angiography. The sensitivity and specificity of CT angiography in the diagnosis of Takayasu arteritis were 95% and 100%, respectively.


CONCLUSION
CT angiography clearly depicts both luminal and mural changes in the thoracic aorta and its major branches and has a high accuracy in the diagnosis of Takayasu arteritis.";-;-;-;hard_0
3780;6991557;Effect of ambient environments on survival of selected bacterial populations in dairy waste solids.;Survival of potentially pathogenic organisms, especially those causing mastitis, indigenous to dairy waste solids was measured over an exposure of 12 days. Selected genera of bacteria were Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Pseudomonas, Salmonella, and Escherichia. Random samples were taken from four locations within each pile of dairy waste solids at 4-day intervals in four replicates. The number of streptococci and salmonella markedly decreased after the first 4 days. The pseudomonas and coliform populations decreased a small but significant amount as did the staphylococci. These results could be in part from various factors such as solar radiation, heavy metals in the solids, or the approximate 45 C increase in temperature within the piles.;-;-;-;hard_0
3783;31833472;Telophase correction refines division orientation in stratified epithelia.;During organogenesis, precise control of spindle orientation balances proliferation and differentiation. In the developing murine epidermis, planar and perpendicular divisions yield symmetric and asymmetric fate outcomes, respectively. Classically, division axis specification involves centrosome migration and spindle rotation, events occurring early in mitosis. Here, we identify a novel orientation mechanism which corrects erroneous anaphase orientations during telophase. The directionality of reorientation correlates with the maintenance or loss of basal contact by the apical daughter. While the scaffolding protein LGN is known to determine initial spindle positioning, we show that LGN also functions during telophase to reorient oblique divisions toward perpendicular. The fidelity of telophase correction also relies on the tension-sensitive adherens junction proteins vinculin, α-E-catenin, and afadin. Failure of this corrective mechanism impacts tissue architecture, as persistent oblique divisions induce precocious, sustained differentiation. The division orientation plasticity provided by telophase correction may enable progenitors to adapt to local tissue needs.;-;-;-;hard_0
3784;6689067;Isolation and characterisation of cDNA clones for the A alpha- and gamma-chains of human fibrinogen.;cDNA clones coding for the A alpha- and gamma-chains of human fibrinogen have been isolated from an adult liver cDNA library. Clones were identified by hybridisation with mixtures of synthetic oligonucleotides 17 bases long, predicted using amino acid sequence data for each chain. The cDNA insert sizes are 1,950bp for A alpha-fibrinogen and 950bp for gamma-fibrinogen. The clones do not show any cross-hybridisation. Each cDNA hybridises to a unique sequence in the human genome. In adult human liver, Northern blots give an estimated messenger RNA size of 2.6kb for A alpha-fibrinogen and 1.8kb for gamma-fibrinogen.;-;-;-;hard_0
3785;9751444;A reversal of the temporal gradient for famous person knowledge in semantic dementia: implications for the neural organisation of long-term memory.;On tests of autobiographical memory, patients with semantic dementia demonstrate significantly better retrieval of episodic events from the recent past compared with the distant past. This reversal of the Ribot effect has been attributed to the relative sparing of the hippocampal complex in the disorder. Current computational models of long-term memory predict a similar time-dependent pattern of impairment on tests of remote semantic memory. Five patients with semantic dementia were tested on recognition (familiarity) and identification (knowledge) of famous names selected from four different time-periods: 1950's, 1980's, 1990-1993 (early 1990's) and 19941996 (current). As expected, it was found that one patient DM (who had focal left temporal lobe atrophy) showed no significant impairment on recognition of famous names, but was significantly better at producing information about people who were currently famous compared to people famous in the other three time-periods. The other four patients (who had bilateral temporal lobe damage) showed better recognition of famous names from the current time-period (and to a lesser extent the 1950's), yet were profoundly impaired on the identification component, producing very little information across all four time-periods. The results are discussed with respect to current views of the neural organisation of person-specific and general semantic memory.;-;-;-;hard_0
3786;3380096;Haploid-specific transcription of protamine-myc and protamine-T-antigen fusion genes in transgenic mice.;"The protamines are small, basic, arginine-rich proteins synthesized postmeiotically in the testes. Analysis of the regulation of synthesis of the protamine mRNA and protein is restricted by the difficulty in culturing and manipulating the cells in which transcription and translation occur. To avoid these problems, we have produced transgenic mice carrying fusion genes in which sequences 5' to the mouse protamine-2 gene have been linked to exons 2 and 3 of the mouse c-myc gene and, separately, to the simian virus 40 (SV40) early region. We show here that the prot.myc gene is correctly regulated; transcription is detected only in the round spermatids. In one family of transgenic mice carrying the 5' protamine-SV40 T-antigen fusion gene, SV40 early-region mRNA accumulated to the highest level in the testes but was also detected in the thymuses, brains, hearts, and preputial glands of the animals. Although we have demonstrated specific transcription of these fusion genes in the round spermatids, we were not able to detect the SV40 T-antigen protein.";polyarginine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
3789;8569755;Protein kinase C beta from Friend erythroleukemia cells is associated with chromatin and DNA.;Certain protein kinase C (PKC) isotypes are localized to the nucleus during cellular proliferation in murine erythroid cells, as well as in human promyelocytic leukemia and erythroleukemia cells. Because the structure of these PKC isotypes contains a conserved cysteine-rich region that contains the zinc finger DNA binding motif, we tested the hypothesis that selected PKC isotypes found in Friend erythroleukemia cells can bind to DNA. Cell lysates from murine Friend erythroleukemia cells, which express alpha, beta I, and beta II PKC, expressed greater amounts of the beta isoforms than the alpha isoform of PKC in their nuclei, and PKC beta I was found in the chromatin of these cells. Lysates of these cells were tested for their ability to bind to a DNA-cellulose column. Bound proteins were eluted with a step gradient of increasing KCl concentrations, and eluant fractions were then subjected to immunoblot analysis using isotype-specific antibodies to the alpha and beta I isotypes of PKC. DNA binding was detected for the PKC beta I isotype, which is present in the nucleus, but not for the more abundant PKC alpha isotype, which resides primarily in the cytoplasm. These results demonstrate that PKC can associate with DNA, and that this association is isotype specific in Friend erythroleukemia cells. ;polycysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function

Neither enzyme had endodeoxyribonuclease activity, but pol B, like pol B of yeast and the corresponding enzyme from Tetrahymena pyriformis, exhibited at least one other nuclease activity directed against denatured DNA and the RNA of an RNA-DNA hybrid. These nuclease functions preferred an alkaline pH and Mg2+. Pol B also exhibited nucleoside diphosphokinase activity. Both enzymes were active with 'activated' DNA and poly[d(A-T)] as primer-templates and were sensitive, especially pol B, to inhibition by excess of native or heat-denatured DNA.

3792;18977752;Translation initiation factor 4B homodimerization, RNA binding, and interaction with Poly(A)-binding protein are enhanced by zinc.;"The eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4B promotes the RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity and ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity of eIF4A and eIF4F during translation initiation. eIF4B also helps to organize the assembly of the translational machinery through its interactions with eIF4A, eIF4G, eIF3, the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), and RNA. Although the function of eIF4B is conserved among plants, animals, and yeast, eIF4B is one of the least conserved of initiation factors at the sequence level. Mammalian eIF4B is a constitutive dimer; however, conflicting reports have suggested that plant eIF4B may exist as a monomer or a dimer. In this study, we show that eIF4B from wheat can form a dimer and we identify the region responsible for its dimerization. Zinc stimulated homodimerization of eIF4B and bound eIF4B with a Kd of 19.7 nM. Zinc increased the activity of the eIF4B C-terminal RNA-binding domain specifically. Zinc promoted the interaction between eIF4B and PABP but not the interaction between eIF4B and eIF4A or eIFiso4G, demonstrating that the effect of zinc was highly specific. The interaction between PABP and eIFiso4G was also stimulated by zinc but required significantly higher levels of zinc. Interestingly zinc abolished the ability of eIFiso4G to compete with eIF4B in binding to their overlapping binding sites in PABP by preferentially promoting the interaction between eIF4B and PABP. Our observations suggest that wheat eIF4B can dimerize but requires zinc. Moreover zinc controls the partner protein selection of PABP such that the interaction with eIF4B is preferred over eIFiso4G.

3796;25960131;Sp1 transcription factor: A long-standing target in cancer chemotherapy.;Sp1 (specificity protein 1) is a well-known member of a family of transcription factors that also includes Sp2, Sp3 and Sp4, which are implicated in an ample variety of essential biological processes and have been proven important in cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis and carcinogenesis. Sp1 activates the transcription of many cellular genes that contain putative CG-rich Sp-binding sites in their promoters. Sp1 and Sp3 proteins bind to similar, if not the same, DNA tracts and compete for binding, thus they can enhance or repress gene expression. Evidences exist that the Sp-family of proteins regulates the expression of genes that play pivotal roles in cell proliferation and metastasis of various tumors. In patients with a variety of cancers, high levels of Sp1 protein are considered a negative prognostic factor. A plethora of compounds can interfere with the trans-activating activities of Sp1 and other Sp proteins on gene expression. Several pathways are involved in the down-regulation of Sp proteins by compounds with different mechanisms of action, which include not only the direct interference with the binding of Sp proteins to their putative DNA binding sites, but also promoting the degradation of Sp protein factors. Down-regulation of Sp transcription factors and Sp1-regulated genes is drug-dependent and it is determined by the cell context. The acknowledgment that several of those compounds are safe enough might accelerate their introduction into clinical usage in patients with tumors that over-express Sp1.  ;polyglycine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
3797;32709066;Distinct Roles for RAB10 and RAB29 in Pathogenic LRRK2-Mediated Endolysosomal Trafficking Alterations.;Mutations in the gene encoding leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) cause familial Parkinson's disease, and sequence variations are associated with the sporadic form of the disease. LRRK2 phosphorylates a subset of RAB proteins implicated in secretory and recycling trafficking pathways, including RAB8A and RAB10. Another RAB protein, RAB29, has been reported to recruit LRRK2 to the Golgi, where it stimulates its kinase activity. Our previous studies revealed that G2019S LRRK2 expression or knockdown of RAB8A deregulate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) trafficking, with a concomitant accumulation of the receptor in a RAB4-positive recycling compartment. Here, we show that the G2019S LRRK2-mediated EGFR deficits are mimicked by knockdown of RAB10 and rescued by expression of active RAB10. By contrast, RAB29 knockdown is without effect, but expression of RAB29 also rescues the pathogenic LRRK2-mediated trafficking deficits independently of Golgi integrity. Our data suggest that G2019S LRRK2 deregulates endolysosomal trafficking by impairing the function of RAB8A and RAB10, while RAB29 positively modulates non-Golgi-related trafficking events impaired by pathogenic LRRK2.;polyleucine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
3802;8387822;The dimanganese(III,IV) oxidation state of catalase from Thermus thermophilus: electron nuclear double resonance analysis of water and protein ligands in the active site.;The 1H hyperfine tensors of the dimanganese(III,IV) oxidation state of the non-heme-type catalase enzyme from the thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus have been measured by electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy at pH 6.5-9. These were compared to model dimanganese(III,IV) complexes possessing six-coordinate N4O2, N3O3, and O6 atom donor sets to each Mn and mu-oxo and mu-carboxylato bridging ligands. The lack of 14N hyperfine couplings in the enzyme suggests either O6 or O5N ligand donors to each Mn. Moreover, the two sigma coordination sites on Mn(III) directed at the dz2 orbital cannot be occupied by N ligands. The 1H ENDOR spectrum revealed two types of anisotropic tensors, attributable to two D2O-exchangeable protons on the basis of the magnitude of the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) line narrowing in D2O. All six of the 1H hyperfine couplings are proposed to arise from a single displaceable water molecule in the active site, on the basis of their reversible disappearance, upon incubation in D2O or by precipitation from ammonium sulfate, and by simulation of the 1H ENDOR spectrum. The Mn ions are coordinated predominantly by nonmagnetic O atoms lacking covalently bound protons in both alpha and beta positions. This implicates predominantly carboxylato-type ligands (Asp and Glu) and possibly a di-mu-oxo bridge between Mn ions. The latter is supported also by the presence of strong antiferromagnetic coupling. Comparison to other dimetalloproteins also possessing the four-helix bundle structural motif shows that the polyoxo(carboxylato) coordination in catalase differs significantly from the polyhistidine coordination adopted by the diiron(II,II) site in the O2-binding protein myohemerythrin, but resembles the polycarboxylato ligation adopted by the diiron(III,III) site of ribonucleotide reductase. The catalase 1H ENDOR spectrum is essentially identical to that for the exchangeable protons in the active site of the diiron(II,III) state of uteroferrin, an acid phosphatase [Doi et al. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 5757-5763], and also for a polycarboxylato complex possessing the Mn2(mu-O)2 core with H-bonded water ligands. The 1H ENDOR line shape in catalase could be simulated using a theoretical model suitable for multispin clusters. It treats the two Mn spins as point dipoles which are exchange-coupled. It includes both dipolar and isotropic ligand hyperfine couplings. Using this model, the position of the proton with the largest interaction could be located with respect to the Mn-Mn vector because of the extreme sensitivity of line shape to position.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) ;polyhistidine;helix;-;LCR_with_function

Over the last decade, imatinib positioned itself as the gold standard of care, until second-generation TKIs were introduced as first-line treatment. Multiple therapeutic options available today in CML make the decision of the first-line therapy a difficult choice. However, a gap still exists, in the management of CML outside academic centers. Important advances in molecular monitoring have been developed worldwide; nevertheless, monitoring in the ""real world"" continues to be a challenge in part because international scale (IS) standardized laboratories are not available worldwide, and also because physicians still have some resource barriers and lack of familiarity restricting guideline adoption and consider optimal molecular monitoring a challenge.

3812;9318837;A compartmental approach to the mechanism of calcification in hermatypic corals;"Ca2+ compartments, Ca2+ transport and the calcification process were studied by using 45Ca as a tracer. The biological model used was clones of Stylophora pistillata developed into microcolonies whose skeleton is entirely covered by tissues, thus avoiding direct radioisotope exchange between the sea water and the skeleton. The study of Ca2+ compartments was performed by measuring two complementary parameters: Ca2+ influx and Ca2+ efflux kinetics. Kinetic analysis of 45Ca uptake revealed three exchangeable and one non-exchangeable Ca2+ compartments in these microcolonies. The first compartment was saturable with a short half-time (4 min), correlated to external Ca2+ concentration and insensitive to metabolic or ion transport inhibitors. This compartment (72.88 nmol Ca2+ mg-1 protein) has been previously attributed to sea water present in the coelenteron. The second Ca2+ compartment (7.12 nmol Ca2+ mg-1 protein) was soluble in NaOH, saturable with a half-time of 20 min and displayed a combination of Michaelis-Menten kinetics and diffusional entry. It was insensitive to a variety of inhibitors but its loading was stimulated by Ca2+ channel inhibitors. On the basis of uptake experiments, the existence of a third compartment with a rapid turnover rate (about 2 min) and a very small size is predicted. It is suggested that this compartment corresponds to the calicoblastic epithelium. Ca2+ flux through this compartment was facilitated by voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (with L-type characteristics) and Ca2+-ATPase and was coupled to an anion carrier. Transcellular Ca2+ movement was dependent on the cytoskeleton. The rate of Ca2+ flux across this epithelium was about 975 pmol mg-1 protein min-1. The fourth calcium compartment, corresponding to the skeleton, was soluble in HCl and non-exchangeable. After a short lag phase (about 2 min), the rate of Ca2+ deposition was linear over a period of at least 5 h. The calcification rate was 975 pmol mg-1 protein h-1 at an irradiance of 175 &micro;mol photons m-2 s-1. It followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics and saturated at levels (9 mmol l-1) close to the Ca2+ concentration of sea water. Wash-out (efflux) experiments employing several different protocols allowed identification of six compartments. The first two compartments were extracellular (bulk extracolonial water and coelenteron). The third compartment may be part of the second Ca2+ compartment identified by influx experiments. A fourth compartment was sensitive to the Ca2+ channel inhibitor D600 and appeared to be associated with the NaOH-soluble (tissue) Ca2+ pool. Two compartments were identified during skeletal efflux, the first being small and due to either tissue carry-over or a labile skeletal compartment. The second compartment corresponded to bulk skeletal deposition. The various efflux protocols produced varying estimates of tissue Ca2+ levels and calcification rates and, thus, coral post-incubation processing has a profound impact on experimental interpretation.";-;-;-;hard_0

The sequence of the appY gene and its promoter region is unusually AT rich. The nucleoid-associated protein H-NS has a DNA-binding specificity for intrinsically curved AT-rich DNA. Using a single-copy transcriptional appY-lacZ fusion, we have shown that appY gene expression is derepressed in hns mutants during aerobic exponential growth. In the hns mutant, growth phase and growth rate regulation under aerobic conditions was maintained, while ArcA-dependent anaerobic induction was greatly diminished. Judged by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the appY promoter fragment exhibits the features characteristic of curved DNA. Gel retardation assays showed that purified H-NS protein bound with high affinity to two different segments of the appY promoter region.

Two labelling methods were used: (1) direct labelling with tin reduction and (2) ligand exchange with tin pyrophosphate. Labelling efficiency and the radiochemical impurities were determined by thin-layer chromatography. Effect of [Sn2+] and pH on labelling yield was investigated to find the optimum labelling conditions. 99mTc-labelled latexes were administered orally to six normal subjects, and scintigrams from the abdomen were obtained at 1, 3, 6, and 24 h. Whole-body scintigrams were also taken by a gamma-camera.

3819;6159644;Le interferon mRNA from human fibroblasts.;"Human F and Le interferon can be clearly distinguished on the basis of different antigenic properties and host range. After inoculation with Newcastle disease virus (NDV), GM-258 fibroblasts produced Le as well as F interferon; in contrast, only F interferon was detectable after stimulation with poly(I) . poly(C). Polyadenylylated mRNA isolated from fibroblasts induced with poly(I) . poly(C) or NDV was injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes and the interferon activities thus produced were analyzed. Only F interferon production was demonstrable in oocytes injected with mRNA from cells induced with poly(I) . poly(C), whereas both F and Le interferons were made in oocytes injected with mRNA from NDV-induced cultures. The time course of accumulation of F and Le interferon mRNAs in NDV-induced cells corresponded to the kinetics of F and Le interferon synthesis in intact cells. The ratio of F and Le interferons made in oocytes was similar to that observed in intact GM-258 cells. F and Le interferon mRNA activities isolated from GM-258 cells could not be separated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. However, the profile of F mRNA activity was more heterogeneous and its peak sedimented somewhat more slowly than that of Le interferon mRNA. These results suggest that the varying ratios of F and Le interferon synthesis in different cells after different modes of stimulation are determined at the level of mRNA. The induction mechanisms of F and Le interferon mRNA synthesis appear to be closely related but not identical. ";polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

In all mouse and human synaptosomal preparations, tau release was inhibited by the selective metabotropic glutamate receptor 2/3 (mGluR2/3) agonist LY379268, an effect prevented by the selective mGlu2/3 antagonist LY341495. LY379268 was also able to block pathologic tau propagation between primary neurons in an in vitro microfluidic cellular model. These novel results are transformational for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms mediating tau release and propagation at synaptic terminals in Alzheimer's disease and suggest that these processes could be inhibited therapeutically by the selective activation of presynaptic G protein-coupled receptors. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Pathological tau release and propagation are key neuropathological events underlying cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease patients. This paper describes the role of regulated exocytosis, and the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) protein SNAP25, in mediating tau release from rodent and human synaptosomes. This paper also shows that a selective mGluR2/3 agonist is highly effective in blocking tau release from synaptosomes and tau propagation between neurons, opening the way to the discovery of novel therapeutic approaches to this devastating disease.;-;-;-;hard_0

Vaccinations using native and recombinant forms of the parasite Gal-lectin have been successful in protecting animals against intestinal amebiasis and amebic liver abscess. Protection against amebic liver abscesses has also been reported by targeting other E. histolytica components including the serine-rich protein and the 29-kDa-reductase antigen.

3825;18635577;The identification and characterization of a FOXL2 response element provides insights into the pathogenesis of mutant alleles.;The Forkhead transcription factor FOXL2 plays a crucial role in ovarian development and maintenance. In humans, its mutations lead to craniofacial abnormalities, isolated or associated with ovarian dysfunction. Using a combinatorial approach, we identified and characterized a FoxL2 response element (FLRE) and showed that it is highly specific and that it diverges from that of other Forkhead transcription factors. This specificity should prevent aberrant regulation of FOXL2 targets by other members of the family and should prevent ectopic activation of the ovarian differentiation program in testes. We provide evidence that the FLRE is used in naturally occurring promoters. We show that polyAlanine expansions of FOXL2, which are the most frequent pathogenic mutations, induce a length-dependent loss of response on different artificial promoter reporters depending on the number and sequence of the FLREs that they contain. Thus, we provide clear mechanistic evidence explaining how the architecture of promoters influences their sensitivity to decreased transcription factor availability. Furthermore, we speculate that the generally absent ovarian phenotype of patients carrying the most frequent polyAlanine expansion should come from its ability to properly regulate high-affinity ovarian targets. The existence of critical high-affinity ovarian targets would be compatible with the role of FOXL2 in reproduction and ensure developmental and functional robustness. Taken together, our results give mechanistic insights on the molecular pathogenesis of FOXL2 polyAlanine expansions. ;polyalanine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
3828;8884095;The prognostic value of cortical magnetic stimulation in acute middle cerebral artery infarction compared to other parameters.;The prognostic value of magnetic evoked potentials (MEP), somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP), age and radiological parameters was determined in 50 patients with acute middle cerebral artery infarction. We performed MEP and SSEP within 4 days and after 6 weeks and 3 months of the infarction and assessed clinical improvement by using the Barthel index (BI) and the Rankin scale. The localization and extent of the infarction was investigated by CT scanning or NMR. All parameters were correlated to clinical outcome and the prognostic significance of each parameter in addition to BI was determined. MEP, SSEP, and age were valuable prognostic parameters in predicting stroke outcome when used together with the BI. However, in stepwise regression analysis using all parameters simultaneously, only MEP and age significantly contributed to clinical outcome in addition to BI. Patients showed a better outcome when their MEP was normal or delayed, measured within 4 days of the infarction, compared to patients with absent MEP. Clinical outcome was better at a younger age.;-;-;-;hard_0
3832;1175657;Studies on the role and mode of operation of the very-lysine-rich histone H1 (F1) in eukaryote chromatin. The properties of the N-terminal and C-terminal halves of histone H1.;Restricted chymotrypsin digestion of calf thymus H1 histone gives two fragments, residues 1--106 and 107--C-terminal. These were studied by proton magnetic resonance and circular dichroism. The N-terminal fragment exhibited some salt-induced structure in aqueous solution, but this did not parallel the globular structure of the intact H1 molecule. Comparison of circular dichroism results with helix predictions for this portion of the molecule suggests that the secondary structure may be the same in this fragment as it is in the corresponding region of the whole molecule. The C-terminal fragments show very little salt-induced structure. The N-terminal fragments binds to DNA very weakly, but the C-terminal fragment binds as strongly as the whole molecule. In the C-terminal fragment, about one quarter of the lysine residues are not bound to the DNA in water, but initial increase of salt concentration causes them to become bound. This increasing binding occurs under the same ionic conditions that cause chromatin condensation and condensation of H1 - DNA complexes, and it is suggested that there may be a connection between these phenomena. ;polylysine;helix;-;LCR_with_function

3838;31783091;Structural characterization and mechanical properties of chimeric Masp1/Flag minispidroins.;Dragline silk has the highest tensile strength among the seven types of spider silks due to its abundant polyalanine motifs. Whereas the flagelliform spider silk is most extensible as its composed spidroin is rich in GPGGX motifs. Most of the spider silk proteins are composed of an extensive repetitive domain flanked by N- and C-terminal domains. To obtain artificial fibers with considerable strength and extensibility, herein a kind of chimeric minispidroins were constructed whose repetitive domain (R) mainly consisted of polyalanine motifs and GPGGX motifs. In our study, NT and CT from Araneus ventricosus MaSp1 were fused with different numbers (1, 4, 8) of repeat domains (R), resulting in three chimeric minispidroins. All these chimeric proteins could form silk-like fibers via manual pulling. As the chimeric spidroin was pulled from the protein solution into fiber by shear forces, the secondary structure transformed from α-helix to β-sheet. Among the three types of fibers, the average tensile strength of NTR4CT ranked the highest (149 MPa), which could provide outstanding material with better mechanical properties. In addition, NT was fused with CT and repetitive domain R respectively, namely NC and NR proteins. As a result, NC could form fibers that had much lower properties than NTR1CT, indicating that repetitive domain was responsible for the strength and elasticity of the fibers. However, NR did not form silk-like fibers, suggesting that Araneus ventricosus Masp1 CT controlled fiber formation. These results broaden the limited knowledge of chimeric spider silk sequences. ;polyalanine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
3841;10064037;Manipulation of the type of fat consumed by growing pigs affects plasma and mononuclear cell fatty acid compositions and lymphocyte and phagocyte functions.;"To investigate the immunological effect of feeding pigs different dietary lipids, 3-wk-old, weaned pigs were fed for 40 d on one of five diets, which differed only in the type of oil present (the oil contributed 5% by weight of the diet and the total fat content of the diets was 8% by weight). The oils used were soybean (control diet), high-oleic sunflower oil (HOSO), sunflower oil (SO), canola oil (CO), and fish oil (FO; rich in long-chain [n-3] polyunsaturared fatty acids). There were no significant differences in initial or final animal weights, weight gains, or health scores among the groups. There were no significant differences in the concentration of anti-Escherichia coli vaccine antibodies in the gut lumens of pigs fed the different diets. The fatty acid composition of the diet markedly affected the fatty acid composition of the plasma and of mononuclear cells (a mixture of lymphocytes, monocytes, and macrophages) prepared from the blood, lymph nodes, or thymus. The FO feeding resulted in a significant increase in the number of circulating granulocytes. The FO feeding significantly decreased the proportion of phagocytes engaged in uptake of E. coli and decreased the activity of those phagocytes that were active. The proliferation of lymphocytes in cultures of whole blood from pigs fed the HOSO, SO, or FO diets was less than in those from pigs fed the CO diet. Proliferation of lymph node lymphocytes from SO- or FO-fed pigs was less than that from control, CO-, or HOSO-fed pigs. The natural killer cell activity of blood lymphocytes from pigs fed the FO diet was significantly reduced compared with those from pigs fed the CO diet. The concentration of PGE2 in the medium of cultured blood, lymph node, or thymic mononuclear cells was lower if the cells came from pigs fed the FO diet. Thus, the type of oil included in the diet of growing pigs affects the numbers and functional activities of immune cells in different body compartments.";-;-;-;hard_0
3845;30968308;The Arabidopsis splicing regulator SR45 confers salt tolerance in a splice isoform-dependent manner.;Functions of most splice isoforms that are generated by alternative splicing are unknown. We show that two splice variants that encode proteins differing in only eight amino acids have distinct functions in a stress response. Serine/arginine-rich (SR) and SR-like proteins, a conserved family of RNA binding proteins across eukaryotes, play important roles in pre-mRNA splicing and other post-transcriptional processes. Pre-mRNAs of SR and SR-like proteins undergo extensive alternative splicing in response to diverse stresses and produce multiple splice isoforms. However, the functions of most splice isoforms remain elusive. Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA of Arabidopsis SR45, which encodes an SR-like splicing regulator, generates two isoforms (long-SR45.1 and short-SR45.2). The proteins encoded by these two isoforms differ in eight amino acids. Here, we investigated the role of SR45 and its splice variants in salt stress tolerance. The loss of SR45 resulted in enhanced sensitivity to salt stress and changes in expression and splicing of genes involved in regulating salt stress response. Interestingly, only the long isoform (SR45.1) rescued the salt-sensitive phenotype as well as the altered gene expression and splicing patterns in the mutant. These results suggest that SR45 positively regulates salt tolerance. Furthermore, only the long isoform is required for SR45-mediated salt tolerance. ;polyarginine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
3847;16186386;BETA2/NeuroD protein can be transduced into cells due to an arginine- and lysine-rich sequence.;BETA2/NeuroD, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, is a key regulator of pancreatic islet morphogenesis and insulin gene transcription. Here we report for the first time that the BETA2/NeuroD protein can permeate several cells, including pancreatic islets, due to an arginine- and lysine-rich protein transduction domain sequence in its structure. The BETA2/NeuroD protein was transduced in a dose-dependent manner up to 1 micromol/l. Transduced BETA2/NeuroD functions similarly to endogenous BETA2/NeuroD: it binds to the insulin promoter and activates its expression. We also investigated the mechanism of BETA2/NeuroD protein transduction. The BETA2/NeuroD protein penetrated cells by macropinocytosis and was released from endosomes homogeneously in cytoplasm and nuclei. These data suggest that BETA2/NeuroD protein transduction could be a safe and valuable strategy for enhancing insulin gene transcription without requiring gene transfer technology. ;polylysine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

3849;36366446;In Silico Characterization of African Swine Fever Virus Nucleoprotein p10 Interaction with DNA.;African swine fever virus (ASFV) is the etiological agent of a highly contagious, hemorrhagic infectious swine disease, with a tremendous sanitary and economic impact on a global scale. Currently, there are no globally available vaccines or treatments. The p10 protein, a structural nucleoprotein encoded by ASFV, has been previously described as capable of binding double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), which may have implications for viral replication. However, the molecular mechanism that governs this interaction is still unknown, mostly due to the lack of a structural model for this protein. In this work, we have generated an ab initio model of the p10 protein and performed extensive structural characterization, using molecular dynamics simulations to identify the motifs and residues regulating DNA recognition. The helix-turn-helix motif identified at the C-terminal region of the protein was shown to be crucial to the dsDNA-binding efficiency. As with other DNA-binding proteins, two distinct serine and lysine-rich regions found in the two helices were identified as key players in the binding to DNA, whose importance was later validated using experimental binding assays. Altogether, these findings may contribute to a better understanding of the p10 function in ASFV replication.;polylysine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
3851;7130046;The musculature of the human renal calices, pelvis and upper ureter.;The musculature of the proximal part of the human upper urinary tract has been examined using light and electron microscopy. Two morphologically and histochemically distinct types of smooth muscle cell have been identified within the walls of the renal calices and pelvis. One type is rich in non-specific cholinesterase and appears identical in fine structure to the smooth muscle of the ureter. The second type is devoid of non-specific cholinesterase and possesses a number of unusual fine structural features. Cells of the latter type form a thin sheet of caliceal muscle which extends across the renal parenchyma to interconnect with adjacent minor calices. Similar cells extend away from the renal substance to form a discrete layer confined to the inner aspect of the muscle coat, the remainder of which consists of 'typical' smooth muscle cells arranged into compact bundles. The inner layer of 'atypical' cells is present in the walls of the major calices and pelvis but ceases in the pelvi-ureteric region. It is proposed that these 'atypical' cells are capable of spontaneous contractility and perform a pacemaker function which is responsible for the initiation of ureteric peristalsis.;-;-;-;hard_0
3853;31096536;Expression of circular RNAs in gynecological tumors: A systematic review.;"The rapid development of bioinformatic technology is boosting the discovery of components hiding in the darkness. As a type of universal, conservative, tissue-specific and stable molecules, circular RNA (circRNA) is a class of endogenous non-coding RNA that has no 5' cap and 3' poly(A) tail and forms a covalently closed continuous loop. At present, 3 types of circRNAs including exonic circRNA (ecRNA), intronic circRNA (ciRNA), and axon-intronic circRNA have been reported. Nowadays informatic technology and high-throughput sequencing have verified the abundance of endogenous circRNAs in eukaryocytes, with predominantly expressed in the cell cytoplasm. Their unique sequences endow them with special functions, such as miRNA sponge, selective transcription or splicing, and attaching to RNA-binding proteins. This review was based on articles published in PubMed databases up to January, 2019, with the following keywords: ""circular RNA"", ""database"", and ""reproductive tumor"" (Flow chart). Original articles and reviews on the topics were selected. Studies have uncovered the interplay between circRNAs and the development of ovarian epithelial tumors, ovarian carcinoma, and cervical carcinoma, which suggesting the potential of circRNAs as biomarkers or therapeutic targets for human diseases. Circular RNA has been found to play a role in gynecological tumors diseases. Meanwhile, we reviewed the studies on how CircularRNA participate in gynecological tumors, which provides a basis for the study of CircularRNA in gynecological tumors.

ADAM17 contributes to hypoxic-induce invasiveness of glioma. In this study, we investigated whether Sp1 transcription factor induces ADAM17 and/or contributes to tumor cell invasiveness in hypoxia. Employing RT-PCR and Western blot, we examined the role of Sp1 in ADAM17 transcription/expression under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and whether it binds to the ADAM17 GC-rich promoter region using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Additionally, we tested the effect of Sp1 suppression in tumor cell invasion and migration, using Matrigel basement membrane invasion chambers, a scratch wound-healing assay, and small interfering RNA. Here, we found that Sp1 binds to the ADAM17 promoter, and that Sp1 regulates ADAM17 expression under hypoxia. Furthermore, suppression of Sp1 decreases invasiveness and migration in U87 tumor cells. Our findings suggest the Sp1 transcription factor mediates ADAM17 expression under hypoxia, regulates glioma invasiveness, and thus, may be a target for anti-invasion therapies. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
3862;10489340;Analysis of the SH3-binding region of HIV-1 nef: partial functional defects introduced by mutations in the polyproline helix and the hydrophobic pocket.;"An SH3-binding domain within the Nef protein of primate lentiviruses has been reported to be important to viral replication and infectivity and dispensable for CD4 downregulation, but its precise role remains unclear. This study investigates the effects of mutations in both the polyproline helix and in the hydrophobic pocket that constitute the SH3-binding domain of Nef. The data demonstrate that the well-studied mutation of the central prolines is only partially disruptive to viral infectivity and replication. The central prolines also make a subtle contribution to the efficiency of CD4 downregulation, detectable only using low levels of Nef expression. Mutation of a conserved arginine in the polyproline helix abrogated more completely Nef-mediated enhancement of viral infectivity; this mutation also adversely affected CD4 downregulation at low levels of Nef expression. Only the R77A mutation substantially impaired downregulation of class I MHC. However, mutation of the central prolines and of R77 yielded proteins that were expressed less efficiently than wild-type Nef. The R77A mutant was expressed most poorly, compatible with its defective phenotypes in all assays. Mutations of the hydrophobic pocket were minimally detrimental to both the virologic and the receptor modulatory functions of Nef. Taken together, this analysis suggests that mutations in the SH3-binding domain do not abrogate fully any Nef-associated phenotype in the absence of detrimental effects on protein expression. We suggest that mutations in this domain can introduce incomplete effects caused by subtle impairments to protein expression; these effects may appear selective under certain experimental conditions due to different sensitivities of the assays to the level of Nef expression.

3865;6402508;Utilization of exogenously added acetyl coenzyme A by intact isolated lysosomes.;"Acetyl coenzyme A has been shown to be required for heparan sulfate degradation for the acetylation of terminal alpha-linked glucosamine residues (Klein, U., Kresse, H., and von Figura, K. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 75, 5185-5189). We can now demonstrate this requirement in intact isolated lysosomes. When lysosomes deficient in the enzyme alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase were incubated at 37 degrees C with [3H]acetyl-CoA, tritium was incorporated primarily into glycosaminoglycans. By utilizing hydrolytic enzymes of known specificity, the labeled glycosaminoglycan was identified as heparan sulfate and the radioactivity was shown to be located in acetyl moieties of terminal alpha-N-acetylglucosamine residues. The acetylation of heparan sulfate in alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase-deficient lysosomes could be stimulated by the addition of 0.5 mM ATP. Lysosomes from normal cells produced some labeled heparan sulfate; however, these organelles showed a significant incorporation of [3H]acetate into free N-acetylglucosamine that was increased over 10-fold by the addition of ATP. The N-acetylation was catalyzed by the enzyme acetyl-CoA:alpha-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase since lysosomes deficient in this enzyme were unable to incorporate [3H]acetate into either heparan sulfate or N-acetylglucosamine even in the presence of ATP. Incorporation of [3H]acetate from [3H]acetyl-CoA into heparan sulfate (by alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase-deficient lysosomes) and into N-acetylglucosamine (by normal lysosomes) showed a similar concentration dependence.

3866;8927895;"[The controversy about so-called ""active euthanasia""].";In the past few years, the discussion about the right to kill severely ill patients for humanitarian reasons--once called euthanasia and after World War II in the German speaking countries as euphemism called 'aktive Sterbehilfe' (active help to die)--has become more intensive. Actually, only the Netherlands do officially practice euthanasia. But the variant that consists in putting a pharmaceutical at the patient's disposal in order to kill himself is very well known in other countries, e.g. in Switzerland, where the pressure on the legislator to also legalize euthanasia grows. Taking into account medico-ethical reasons, historical experiences, alarming euthanasia ideas in bioethics and social philosophy, the danger due to the impossibility to control the development in this field, and the insidious extension of euthanasia indications, the author rejects firmly the idea of legalized euthanasia. These problems are related to those that occur in fixing the moment of death of potential organ donors. A lack of organs in transplantation medicine should not lead physicians to explant organs from donors in a dying condition. For physicians who take care of potential organ donors and who have to look after their interests towards transplantation teams, it is often too difficult to cope with this task.

3872;8524296;A homolog of human transcription factor NF-X1 encoded by the Drosophila shuttle craft gene is required in the embryonic central nervous system.;NF-X1 is a novel cytokine-inducible transcription factor that has been implicated in the control of immune responses in humans, presumably by regulating expression of class II major histocompatibility genes. Here we report the cloning and genetic characterization of the first reported NF-X1 homolog, which is encoded by the Drosophila melanogaster shuttle craft (stc) gene. The deduced sequence of the fly and human proteins defines a new family of molecules distinguished by a novel cysteine-rich DNA-binding motif (consisting of seven copies of the consensus sequence Cx3Cx3LxCGx0-5HxCx3CHxGxCx2Cx7-9CxC). We have identified and begun a phenotypic characterization of mutations in the stc gene. stc mutants die at the end of embryogenesis, when they appear to be incapable of coordinating the typical peristaltic contraction waves normally required for embryos to hatch into feeding first instar larvae. Preliminary evidence indicates that the resulting lethality of this behavioral defect is accompanied by subtle morphological abnormalities in the central nervous system, where in wild-type embryos, STC protein is normally localized in the nuclei of repeated cell clusters within each neuromere and brain lobe. Thus, the NF-X1 homolog encoded by the Drosophila stc gene defines a new family of putative transcription factors and plays an essential role in the completion of embryonic development. This study presents the first in vivo genetic analysis of a member of this new protein family. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
3874;17450572;Influence of local and residual structures on the scaling behavior and dimensions of unfolded proteins.;Although recent spectroscopic studies of chemically denatured proteins hint at significant nonrandom residual structure, the results of extensive small angle X-ray scattering studies suggest random coil behavior, calling for a coherent understanding of these seemingly contradicting observations. Here, we report the results of a Monte Carlo study of the effects of two types of local structures, alpha helix and Polyproline II (PPII) helix, on the dimensions of random coil polyalanine chains viewed as a model of highly denatured proteins. We find that although Flory's power law scaling, long regarded as a signature of random coil behavior, holds for chains containing up to 90% alpha or PPII helix, the absolute magnitude of the chain dimensions is sensitive to helix content. As residual alpha helix content increases, the chain contracts until it reaches a minimum radius at approximately 70% helix, after which the chain dimensions expand rapidly. With an alpha helix content of approximately 20%, corresponding to the Ramachandran probability of being in the helical basin, experimentally observed radii of gyration are recovered. Experimental radii are similarly recovered at an alpha helix content of approximately 87%, providing an explanation for the previously puzzling experimental finding that the dimensions of the highly helical methanol-induced unfolded state are experimentally indistinguishable from those of the helix-poor urea-unfolded state. In contrast, the radius of gyration increases monotonically with increasing PPII content, and is always more expanded than the dimensions observed experimentally. These results suggest that PPII is unlikely the sole, dominant preferred conformation for unfolded proteins. ;polyalanine;helix;-;LCR_with_function

Modulation of reversible and covalent interaction of diflunisal acyl glucuronide and its isomers with human plasma protein in vitro.;Acyl glucuronide conjugates are chemically reactive metabolites which can undergo hydrolysis, rearrangement (isomerization via acyl migration) and covalent binding reactions with protein. The present study was undertaken to identify factors modulating the reactivity of diflunisal acyl glucuronide (DAG) with human serum albumin (HSA) in vitro, by comprehensively evaluating the interplay of the three pathways above when DAG and a mixture of its 2-, 3- and 4-isomers (iso-DAG) were incubated with protein. Buffer, plasma, fraction V HSA, fatty acid-free HSA, globulin-free HSA and fatty acid- and globulin-free HSA were investigated at pH 7.4 and 37 degrees, each in the absence and presence of warfarin, diazepam and diflunisal (DF) as reversible binding competitors. DAG and iso-DAG were highly reversibly bound (ca. 98-99.5%) in plasma and HSA solutions. The binding was primarily at the benzodiazepine site, since displacement occurred in the presence of diazepam and fatty acids but not warfarin. DAG degradation, via rearrangement, hydrolysis and covalent adduct formation (in that order of quantitative importance), was retarded in plasma and HSA solutions compared to buffer. The protective effect of protein was afforded by the high reversible binding to the (non-catalytic) benzodiazepine site. The warfarin site appeared to be catalytic for DAG hydrolysis, whereas rearrangement appeared to be hydroxide ion-catalysed only. In contrast to DAG, iso-DAG degradation was greatly accelerated in the presence of protein, through both covalent binding and catalysis of hydrolysis. Covalent binding via DAG was increased in the presence of warfarin but decreased in the presence of diazepam, DF and fatty acids. The opposite effects were found for covalent binding via iso-DAG. The data suggest that covalent binding of DF to HSA via DAG and iso-DAG occurs by different mechanisms (presumably transacylation and glycation, respectively) at different sites (benzodiazepine and warfarin, respectively) whereas reversible binding occurs primarily at the same site (benzodiazepine).;-;-;-;hard_0
3880;9668200;New methods of protein purification. Expanded bed chromatography.;This review considers a new method of protein purification--expanded bed chromatography. The method is based on pumping of the mobile phase upwards through the column bed. The bed starts to expand at liquid flow rate above a critical value, and the gaps between the sorbent beads expand. The controlled distribution of bead size and weight results in a stable expanded bed, where separate beads are not completely immobile, but oscillate about some steady position. The mobile phase flow through such a column is similar to plug flow. The main advantage of expanded bed chromatography is that it enables protein recovery directly from particulate-containing feed stocks like cell homogenates or even fermentation broth, when extracellular proteins are purified. The successful examples of protein purification by expanded bed chromatography and the available commercial systems are presented. The standard equipment for liquid protein chromatography can be used in the expanded bed mode.;-;-;-;hard_0
3881;8541497;Activity of single-stranded DNA endonucleases in mung bean is associated with cell division.;A single-strand-specific endonuclease from mung bean sprouts is widely used in molecular biology. However, the biological role of this enzyme is unknown. We studied the spatial and temporal activity of single-stranded DNA endonucleases in mung bean seedling by following enzyme activity that linearizes supercoiled plasmid DNA, a characteristic of this type of enzyme. The formation of a linear molecule from supercoiled DNA was found to occur in two distinguishable steps. The first, which involves introducing a nick into the supercoiled DNA and relaxing it, is very rapid and complete within a few seconds. The second step of cleaving the opposite strand to generate a unit-length linear duplex DNA is a relatively slow process. Analysis of the DNA cleavage sites showed the nuclease preferentially cuts supercoiled DNA at an AT-rich region. Varying levels of nuclease activity could be detected in different tissues of the mung bean seedling. The highest activity was in the root tip and was correlated with histone H1 kinase activity. This implies a link between nuclease activity and cell division. Induction of cell division in mung bean hypocotyls with auxin promoted formation of root primordia and considerably increased the activity of single-stranded DNA endonucleases. The nuclease activity and histone H1 kinase activity were reduced in mung bean cuttings treated with hydroxyurea, but not in cuttings treated with oryzalin. The potential function of single-stranded DNA endonucleases is discussed. ;polythreonine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
3885;25195759;Structure of Rot, a global regulator of virulence genes in Staphylococcus aureus.;Staphylococcus aureus is a highly versatile pathogen that can infect human tissue by producing a large arsenal of virulence factors that are tightly regulated by a complex regulatory network. Rot, which shares sequence similarity with SarA homologues, is a global regulator that regulates numerous virulence genes. However, the recognition model of Rot for the promoter region of target genes and the putative regulation mechanism remain elusive. In this study, the 1.77 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of Rot is reported. The structure reveals that two Rot molecules form a compact homodimer, each of which contains a typical helix-turn-helix module and a β-hairpin motif connected by a flexible loop. Fluorescence polarization results indicate that Rot preferentially recognizes AT-rich dsDNA with ~30-base-pair nucleotides and that the conserved positively charged residues on the winged-helix motif are vital for binding to the AT-rich dsDNA. It is proposed that the DNA-recognition model of Rot may be similar to that of SarA, SarR and SarS, in which the helix-turn-helix motifs of each monomer interact with the major grooves of target dsDNA and the winged motifs contact the minor grooves. Interestingly, the structure shows that Rot adopts a novel dimerization model that differs from that of other SarA homologues. As expected, perturbation of the dimer interface abolishes the dsDNA-binding ability of Rot, suggesting that Rot functions as a dimer. In addition, the results have been further confirmed in vivo by measuring the transcriptional regulation of α-toxin, a major virulence factor produced by most S. aureus strains. ;polythreonine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
3887;7903188;Potent analgesia induced in rats by combined action at PCP and polyamine recognition sites of the NMDA receptor complex.;The present study was performed to examine the analgesic effects of the intrathecal administration of agents acting at various sites in the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor complex on the nociceptive responses to s.c. formalin injection in rats. Both the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) and the non-competitive NMDA antagonist dizocilpine maleate (MK-801) produced dose-dependent analgesic effects in the late, but not the early, phase of the formalin test. The polyamine antagonist ifenprodil, and the strychnine-insensitive glycine antagonists DCQX and 7-chlorokynurenic acid, failed to produce any analgesic effects in either the early or the late phase of the formalin test. The analgesic effects of APV were enhanced slightly by combined administration with a non-analgesic dose of glycine, and the analgesic effects of MK-801 were dramatically potentiated by combined administration of a non-analgesic dose of the polyamine spermine. The results indicate that much more potent analgesia can be produced in the formalin test by a combination of open channel blockers (such as MK-801) with agonists acting at the polyamine site, than by a single treatment with antagonists to either glycine allosteric or polyamine sites within the NMDA receptor complex.;-;-;-;hard_0

Comparing days with temperature above 38 degrees C (100.4 degrees F), days under antibiotics, and absence from work during equal periods with and without Sandoglobulin, the beneficial effect of this preparation is obvious. Sandoglobulin can be recommended for longterm therapy in ADS.;-;-;-;hard_0
3894;12791702;Subcellular localization and mechanisms of nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of steroid receptor coactivator-1.;Steroid hormone receptors are ligand-stimulated transcription factors that modulate gene transcription by recruiting coregulators to gene promoters. Subcellular localization and dynamic movements of transcription factors have been shown to be one of the major means of regulating their transcriptional activity. In the present report we describe the subcellular localization and the dynamics of intracellular trafficking of steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1). After its synthesis in the cytoplasm, SRC-1 is imported into the nucleus, where it activates transcription and is subsequently exported back to the cytoplasm. In both the nucleus and cytoplasm, SRC-1 is localized in speckles. The characterization of SRC-1 nuclear localization sequence reveals that it is a classic bipartite signal localized in the N-terminal region of the protein, between amino acids 18 and 36. This sequence is highly conserved within the other members of the p160 family. Additionally, SRC-1 nuclear export is inhibited by leptomycin B. The region involved in its nuclear export is localized between amino acids 990 and 1038. It is an unusually large domain differing from the classic leucine-rich NES sequences. Thus SRC-1 nuclear export involves either an alternate type of NES or is dependent on the interaction of SRC-1 with a protein, which is exported through the crm1/exportin pathway. Overall, the intracellular trafficking of SRC-1 might be a mechanism to regulate the termination of hormone action, the interaction with other signaling pathways in the cytoplasm and its degradation. ;polyleucine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
3899;7491915;Anemia in copper-deficient rats: role of alterations in erythrocyte membrane fluidity and oxidative damage.;This study was designed to make precise the nature and the mechanism of the anemia induced by dietary copper (Cu) deficiency. Male Wistar rats were pair fed from weanling for 6 wk either a Cu-deficient or a control diet. The reduced red blood cell (RBC) 51Cr survival indicates an increased destruction of RBC during Cu deficiency. 1,6-Diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene fluorescence polarization studies revealed an increase in the fluidity of erythrocyte membranes from deficient rats. The reduced cholesterol-to-phospholipid ratio was consistent with the increased fluidity. Other results indicate an increased vulnerability of RBC to hemolysis in dilute hydrogen peroxide and an increased formation of lipid peroxidation products. Before exposure to free radical stress, electron spin resonance studies in intact RBC revealed decreased correlation time of 16-doxyl-stearic acid, confirming a more fluid membrane in RBC from Cu-deficient rats. After in vitro peroxidation, RBC from Cu-deficient rats showed a more ordered state of membrane lipids compared with controls. Together, these studies demonstrate the hemolytic nature of the anemia. The shortened survival of erythrocytes apparently results from changes in membrane fluidity and enhanced susceptibility to peroxidation.;-;-;-;hard_0
3900;9054409;The crystal structure of the liver fatty acid-binding protein. A complex with two bound oleates.;The crystal structure of the recombinant form of rat liver fatty acid-binding protein was completed to 2.3 A and refined to an R factor of 19.0%. The structural solution was obtained by molecular replacement using superimposed polyalanine coordinates of six intracellular lipid-binding proteins as a search probe. The entire amino acid sequence of rat liver fatty acid-binding protein along with an amino-terminal formyl-methionine was modeled in the crystal structure. In addition, the crystal was obtained in the presence of oleic acid, and the initial electron density clearly showed two fatty acid molecules bound within a central cavity. The carboxylate of one fatty acid molecule interacts with arginine 122 and is shielded from free solvent. It has an overall bent conformation. The more solvent-exposed carboxylate of the other oleate is located near the helix-turn-helix that caps one end of the beta-barrel, while the acyl chain lies in the interior. The cavity contains both polar and nonpolar residues but also shows extensive hydrophobic character around the nonpolar atoms of the ligands. The primary and secondary oleate binding sites appear to be totally interdependent, mainly because favorable hydrophobic interactions form between both aliphatic chains. ;polyalanine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
3901;6499130;Interaction of canine carotid sinus and aortic arch baroreflexes in the control of total peripheral resistance.;Interaction of carotid sinus and aortic arch reflex control of total peripheral resistance was studied in eight dogs anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and placed on constant flow cardiac bypass. Carotid sinus and aortic arch baroreceptor areas were isolated and separately perfused at controlled pressures. Combinations of carotid sinus and aortic arch pressures were delivered at random in steps of 25 mm Hg over the 50-225 mm Hg pressure range, and systemic arterial pressure was measured. Changes in arterial pressure reflected changes in total peripheral resistance. A multiple linear regression showed that both carotid sinus and aortic arch pressures exhibited a sigmoidal relationship with arterial pressure. Independent of carotid and aortic baroreceptor pressures, arterial pressure was found to be a periodic function of time (period = 2 hours) in all dogs. The average carotid sinus reflex open loop gain was found to be 0.231 +/- 0.092, while average aortic arch open loop gain was 0.141 +/- 0.088. The gain of either the carotid sinus or aortic arch reflex was not influenced by the absolute pressure level of the other receptor area. In a separate series of experiments performed in the same dogs, we tested the hypothesis that a nonlinear temporal summation of the reflex control of total peripheral resistance might exist when the inputs to carotid and aortic baroreceptors are changed simultaneously. With both inputs held at the region of maximum gain, 25 mm Hg step changes were imposed first on carotid sinus pressure, then on aortic arch pressure, and then on both simultaneously. A temporal inhibition of the two reflexes showed that simultaneous excitation of both receptors resulted in a smaller reflex response than the sum of individual responses.;-;-;-;hard_0
3902;27346150;Molecular characterization and expression analyses of three RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway genes (MDA5, LGP2 and MAVS) in Larimichthys crocea.;In this study, we sequenced and characterized melanoma differentiation-associated antigen 5 (LcMDA5), laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LcLGP2) and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (LcMAVS) from large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea). The LcMDA5 encodes 969 amino acids and contains two caspase-associated and recruitment domains (CARDs), a DExDc (DExD/H box-containing domain), a HELICc (helicase superfamily C-terminal domain) and a C-terminal regulatory domain (RD). The LcLGP2 encodes 679 amino acids and contains a DExDc, a HELICc and a RD. The LcMAVS encodes 512 amino acids and contains a CARD, a proline-rich domain, a transmembrane helix domain and a putative TRAF2-binding motif ((269)PVQDT(273)). Phylogenetic analyses showed that all the three genes of large yellow croaker are clustered together with their counterparts from other teleost fishes. The Real-time PCR analyses showed that all the three genes were found to be constitutively expressed in all examined tissues in large yellow croaker, but all with relatively low expression levels. Expression analyses showed that the three genes were all rapidly and significantly upregulated in vivo after poly (I:C) challenge in peripheral blood, liver, spleen and head kidney tissues. The results indicate that the LcMDA5, LcLGP2 and LcMAVS might play important roles in antiviral immune responses.  ;polyproline;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
3904;12136662;[Involvement of E2FBP1, an ARID family member protein, in the p53 regulatory pathway].;E2FBP1, an ARID (AT-rich interaction domain) family protein, has been isolated as a protein that interacts with E2F-1, a member for the E2F family transcription factor. The closely related Bright binds to specific AT-rich DNA sequences and regulates B-cell-specific gene expression. Although Bright is specifically expressed in differentiating and matured B cells, E2FBP1 is expressed ubiquitously in a variety of tissues, suggesting that E2FBP1 plays a role in different biological processes. However, the function of E2FBP1 remains largely unknown. The present work showed that expression of E2FBP1 protein was up-regulated by forced expression of p53, and its expression levels were low, in tumor cells lacking wild-type p53. Furthermore, E2FBP1 levels were increased following DNA damage, in parallel with levels of p53 and p21 Waf1/Cip1. In addition, coimmunoprecipitation assays indicated that E2FBP1 could interact with p53 in vivo. These results suggest the possibility that E2FBP1 is involved in the p53 regulatory pathway. ;polythreonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
3908;25102891;Bordetella pertussis fimbriae (Fim): relevance for vaccines.;Bordetella pertussis produces two serologically distinct fimbriae, Fim2 and Fim3. Expression of these antigens is governed by the BvgA/S system and by the length of a poly(C) tract in the promoter of each gene. Fim2 and Fim3 are important antigens for whole cell pertussis vaccines as clinical trials have shown an association of anti-fimbriae antibody-mediated agglutination and protection. The current five component acellular pertussis vaccine contains co-purified Fim2/3 and provided good efficacy in clinical trials with the anti-Fim antibody response correlating with protection when pre and post exposure antibody levels were analysed. The predominant serotype of B. pertussis isolates has changed over time in most countries but it is not understood whether this is vaccine-driven or whether serotype is linked to the prevailing predominant genotype. Recent studies have shown that both Fim2 and Fim3 are expressed during infection and that Fim2 is more immunogenic than Fim3 in the acellular vaccine.  ;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
3911;7530842;Binding of Y-box proteins to RNA: involvement of different protein domains.;Eukaryotic Y-box proteins are reported to interact with a wide variety of nucleic acid structures to act as transcription factors and mRNA masking proteins. The modular structure of Y-box proteins includes a highly conserved N-terminal cold-shock domain (CSD, equivalent to the bacterial cold-shock proteins) plus four basic C-terminal domains containing arginine clusters and aromatic residues. In addition, the basic domains are separated by acidic regions which contain several potential sites for serine/threonine phosphorylation. The interaction of Y-box proteins, isolated from Xenopus oocytes (FRGY2 type), with RNA molecules has been studied by UV crosslinking and protein fragmentation. We have identified two distinct binding activities. The CSD interacts preferentially with the polypurines poly(A,G) and poly(G) but not poly(A), this activity being sensitive to 5 mM MgCl2 but not to 5 mM spermidine. In the presence of 1 mM MgCl2 or 1 mM spermidine, the basic domains interact preferentially with poly(C,U), this activity being sensitive to 0.5 M NaCl. Binding of the basic domains is also sensitive to low concentrations of heparin. The basic domains can be crosslinked individually to labelled RNA. These results are discussed with reference to the various specificities noted in the binding of Y-box proteins to RNA and DNA. ;polyalanine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

3916;15936902;Spi-1 and Spi-B control the expression of the Grap2 gene in B cells.;The Ets family members Spi-1 and Spi-B have been implicated in the regulation of genes important for B cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling. Mice deficient in Spi-B exhibit reduced B cell proliferation in response to BCR cross-linking and impaired T cell-dependent immune responses. This defect is exacerbated in the presence of Spi-1 haplo-insufficiency (Spi1+/- SpiB-/-). Tyrosine phosphorylation and calcium mobilization induced by BCR engagement is diminished in Spi1+/- SpiB-/- B lymphocytes, although many key BCR signaling proteins are expressed, suggesting that Spi-1 and Spi-B regulate expression of additional, unidentified signaling molecules. We now demonstrate that expression of the adaptor protein Grap2 is impaired in Spi1+/- SpiB+/- and Spi1+/- SpiB-/- B lymphocytes. Analysis of two alternate murine Grap2 promoters revealed a functionally important Spi-1 and Spi-B DNA binding element located in the downstream promoter. Ectopic expression of Grap2 in Grap2-deficient B cells reduced the recruitment of BLNK to Igalpha and the phosphorylation of specific substrates. Regulation of BLNK recruitment was dependent upon the Grap2 proline-rich domain, while modulation of phosphorylation was dependent upon both the proline-rich and SH2 domains. These data indicate that Spi-1 and Spi-B directly regulate the expression of Grap2 and that Grap2 functions to modulate BCR signaling, but that reduced Grap2 expression is unlikely to account for the BCR signaling defects observed in Spi1+/- SpiB-/- B cells. ;polyproline;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
3918;7906191;Pain management in Canadian level 3 neonatal intensive care units.;"OBJECTIVE
To determine current practices in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) of managing postoperative pain, pain associated with nonsurgical procedures and disease-related pain.


DESIGN
Retrospective, self-administered descriptive mail survey.


SETTING
Level 3 NICUs in Canada.


PARTICIPANTS
The head nurses of the 30 Canadian level 3 NICUs in February 1992; 26 (87%) responded.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Five-point Likert scale of Always (in 100% of cases), Often (in 75% to 99%), Usually (in 25% to 74%), Rarely (in 1% to 24%) and Never (in 0%). Selected items were validated through a chart review.


RESULTS
Opioids were used postoperatively always or often in 93% (13/14), 88% (15/17) and 65% (11/17) of the NICUs that cared for neonates having undergone cardiac, major and minor surgery respectively. Most of the NICUs did not use paralysis or sedation alone for postoperative pain management. Local anesthesia was used always or often for emergent chest tube placement in 16% (4/25) of the NICUs, for elective chest tube placement in 48% (12/25) and for lumbar puncture in 12% (3/24). An analgesic was rarely or never used for insertion of a tracheal tube in emergent situations in 88% (23/26) of the NICUs and in elective situations in 84% (21/25); the corresponding figures for sedative use were 85% (22/26) and 73% (19/26). Only 22% (5/23) used opioids regularly in cases of nonsurgically managed necrotizing enterocolitis. Physicians alone determined the rate of opioid weaning in 54% (13/24) of the NICUs. Opioids were usually described as being weaned as tolerated.


CONCLUSIONS
Analgesic use for the management of postoperative pain in neonates having undergone cardiac and major surgery is frequent but continues to be infrequent in the postoperative care of patients having undergone minor surgery in some NICUs. Procedural and disease-related pain is frequently untreated or undertreated. Guidelines for establishing a protocol to manage pain in NICUs are given.";-;-;-;hard_0
3921;9092617;The ZiN/POZ domain of ZF5 is required for both transcriptional activation and repression.;"ZF5 is a ubiquitously expressed protein originally identified by its ability to bind and repress the murine c-myc promoter. It contains five C-terminal zinc fingers and a conserved N-terminal ZiN/POZ domain. This motif, found in a growing number of zinc finger proteins, can inhibit DNA binding and mediate dimerization [Bardwell, V.J. and Treisman,R. (1994) Genes Dev., 8,1664-1677]. In the current study, a cyclic amplification and selection of targets (CAST) protocol detected preferred ZF5 binding sites which are highly GC-rich. Binding to these sites by ZF5 depended upon the zinc fingers and was enhanced when the ZiN/POZ domain was removed. Using transient cotransfection assays, ZF5 was shown to activate the HIV-1 LTR and repress the beta-actin promoter. The ZiN/POZ domain was shown to mediate ZF5-dependent transcriptional activation and repression. From these data, we conclude that ZF5 can both activate and repress in the context of different natural promoters and that its ZiN/POZ domain can affect two functions; DNA binding and transcriptional modulation.

3922;25074915;Structure-function analysis of mouse Sry reveals dual essential roles of the C-terminal polyglutamine tract in sex determination.;The mammalian sex-determining factor SRY comprises a conserved high-mobility group (HMG) box DNA-binding domain and poorly conserved regions outside the HMG box. Mouse Sry is unusual in that it includes a C-terminal polyglutamine (polyQ) tract that is absent in nonrodent SRY proteins, and yet, paradoxically, is essential for male sex determination. To dissect the molecular functions of this domain, we generated a series of Sry mutants, and studied their biochemical properties in cell lines and transgenic mouse embryos. Sry protein lacking the polyQ domain was unstable, due to proteasomal degradation. Replacing this domain with irrelevant sequences stabilized the protein but failed to restore Sry's ability to up-regulate its key target gene SRY-box 9 (Sox9) and its sex-determining function in vivo. These functions were restored only when a VP16 transactivation domain was substituted. We conclude that the polyQ domain has important roles in protein stabilization and transcriptional activation, both of which are essential for male sex determination in mice. Our data disprove the hypothesis that the conserved HMG box domain is the only functional domain of Sry, and highlight an evolutionary paradox whereby mouse Sry has evolved a novel bifunctional module to activate Sox9 directly, whereas SRY proteins in other taxa, including humans, seem to lack this ability, presumably making them dependent on partner proteins(s) to provide this function.  ;polyglutamine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

3929;9773976;Functional interaction between the estrogen receptor and CTF1: analysis of the vitellogenin gene B1 promoter in yeast.;Eukaryotic gene expression depends on a complex interplay between the transcriptional apparatus and chromatin structure. We report here a yeast model system for investigating the functional interaction between the human estrogen receptor (hER) and CTF1, a member of the CTF/NFI transcription factor family. We show that a CTF1-fusion protein and the hER transactivate a synthetic promoter in yeast in a synergistic manner. This interaction requires the proline-rich transactivation domain of CTF1. When the natural estrogen-dependent vitellogenin B1 promoter is tested in yeast, CTF1 and CTF1-fusion proteins are unable to activate transcription, and no synergy is observed between hER, which activates the B1 promoter, and these factors. Chromatin structure analysis on this promoter reveals positioned nucleosomes at -430 to -270 (+/-20 bp) and at -270 to - 100 (+/-20 bp) relative to the start site of transcription. The positions of the nucleosomes remain unchanged upon hormone-dependent transcriptional activation of the promoter, and the more proximal nucleosome appears to mask the CTF/NFI site located at - 101 to -114. We conclude that a functional interaction of hER with the estrogen response element located upstream of a basal promoter occurs in yeast despite the nucleosomal organization of this promoter, whereas the interaction of CTF1 with its target site is apparently precluded by a nucleosome. ;polyproline;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
3933;6194213;Blockade of NK cell lysis is a property of monoclonal antibodies that bind to distinct regions of T-200.;The previously described NK inhibitory monoclonal antibody 13.1 is shown to immunoprecipitate a series of high m.w. glycoproteins homologous with the murine T-200/Ly-5 molecules. Not all antibodies to the human T-200 molecule, however, have an inhibitory effect on NK cell function. A comparison is made between two noninhibitory anti-T-200 antibodies, 13.5 and 13.6, and two inhibitory anti-T-200 antibodies, 13.1 and 13.3. All antibodies are of the IgG1 subclass. Sequential immunoprecipitation experiments show that these antibodies react with the same set of molecules. The differences in NK-blocking activity could not be explained by the amount of antibody bound per cell in NK-enriched populations, nor by the avidity with which they bound. It is shown by competitive radiobinding assays that the 13.1 and 13.3 antibodies define a region, termed region A, distinct from that defined by the nonblocking antibodies 13.5 and 13.6, termed region B. Region B is shown to reside between the membrane and region A. These findings show that the inhibition of NK lysis by anti-T-200 antibodies is a function of the site on that molecule to which these antibodies bind. This may also explain the ability of antibodies to the A region of T-200 to block selectively the lysis of myeloid and erythroid tumor targets, with no effect on the lysis of T lymphoma targets.;-;-;-;hard_0

Although the concentration of antiplatelet antibody in maternal serum frequently reflected the severity of neonatal thrombocytopenia, a number of exceptions to this observation limited the clinical usefulness of the test for individual patients. Antiplatelet antibody levels in the amniotic fluid were always low. A twin gestation in this series of patients in which one infant was thrombocytopenic and the other was not also showed that no antepartum maternal clinical characteristic or laboratory test can accurately predict the fetal platelet count.

As this marker is intimately linked to the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome in several large pedigrees, human dri (DRIL1) is a candidate gene for this disorder. ;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
3941;34977379;Nutritional stimulation by in-ovo feeding modulates cellular proliferation and differentiation in the small intestinal epithelium of chicks.;Nutritional stimulation of the developing small intestine of chick embryos can be conducted by in-ovo feeding (IOF). We hypothesized that IOF of glutamine and leucine can enhance small intestinal development by promoting proliferation and differentiation of multipotent small intestinal epithelial cells. Broiler embryos (n = 128) were subject to IOF of glutamine (IOF-Gln), leucine (IOF-Leu), NaCl (IOF-NaCl) or no injection (control) at embryonic d 17 (E 17). Multipotent, progenitor and differentiated cells were located and quantified in the small intestinal epithelium between E 17 and d 7 after hatch (D 7) in all treatment groups by immunofluorescence of SRY-box transcription factor 9 (Sox9) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), in-situ hybridization of leucine-rich repeat containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) and peptide transporter 1 (PepT1) and histochemical goblet cell staining. The effects of IOF treatments at E 19 (48 h post-IOF), in comparison to control embryos, were as follows: total cell counts increased by 40%, 33% and 19%, and multipotent cell counts increased by 52%, 50% and 38%, in IOF-Gln, IOF-Leu and IOF-NaCl embryos, respectively. Only IOF-Gln embryos exhibited a significance, 36% increase in progenitor cell counts. All IOF treatments shifted Lgr5+ stem cell localizations to villus bottoms. The differentiated, PepT1+ region of the villi was 1.9 and 1.3-fold longer in IOF-Gln and IOF-Leu embryos, respectively, while goblet cell densities decreased by 20% in IOF-Gln embryos. Post-hatch, crypt and villi epithelial cell counts were significantly higher IOF-Gln chicks, compared to control chicks (P < 0.05). We conclude IOF of glutamine stimulates small intestinal maturation and functionality during the peri-hatch period by promoting multipotent cell proliferation and differentiation, resulting in enhanced compartmentalization of multipotent and differentiated cell niches and expansions of the absorptive surface area.;polyleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
3944;11020349;Characterization of a class of cationic peptides able to facilitate efficient protein transduction in vitro and in vivo.;Protein transduction domains (PTDs), such as the third helix of the Drosophila Antennapedia homeobox gene (Antp) and the HIV TAT PTD, possess a characteristic positive charge on the basis of their enrichment for arginine and lysine residues. To determine whether cationic peptides are able to function as protein transduction domains, 12-mer peptide sequences from an M13 phage library were selected for synthesis on the basis of their varying cationic charge content. In addition, polylysine and polyarginine peptides were synthesized in order to assess the effect of charge contribution in protein transduction. Coupling of the biotinylated peptides to avidin-beta-galactosidase facilitated transduction in a wide variety of cell lines and primary cells, including islet beta-cells, synovial cells, polarized airway epithelial cells, dendritic cells, myoblasts, and tumor cells. Two of the peptides, PTD-4 and PTD-5, mediated transduction nearly 600-fold more efficiently than a random control peptide, but with an efficiency similar to the TAT PTD and the 12 mers of polylysine and polyarginine. Furthermore, confocal analysis of biotinylated peptide-streptavidin-Cy3 conjugates demonstrated that the internalized PTDs are found in both the nuclei and the cytoplasm of treated cells. When tested in vivo, the PTDs were able to facilitate efficient and rapid protein delivery into rabbit synovium and mouse solid tumors following intraarticular and intratumoral administration, respectively. These novel PTDs can be used to transfer therapeutic proteins and DNA for the treatment of a wide variety of diseases, including arthritis and cancer. ;polyarginine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
3946;20519371;The poly(c)-binding protein-1 regulates expression of the androgen receptor.;The androgen receptor (AR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor, expressed in male and female reproductive organs, and essential for normal reproduction in both sexes. The levels of AR are tightly controlled in androgen-responsive cells in which it plays a central role in the regulation of target gene expression. The AR is abundantly expressed in human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs), but levels decline markedly after differentiation into decidual cells in vivo and in primary cultures. Decidualization profoundly down-regulated AR protein levels with no discernible effect on either AR mRNA or protein stability, suggesting that loss of the receptor was a consequence of translational inhibition. Here we show that HESCs express three RNA-binding proteins, Hu antigen R and the poly(C)-binding proteins PCBP1 and PCBP2, that reportedly target the 3'-untranslated region of AR transcripts. Only PCBP1 expression was enhanced in secretory endometrium in vivo and in decidualizing HESCs. Furthermore, knockdown of PCBP1 in decidualizing cells was sufficient to restore AR protein levels, indicating that loss of the AR protein is primarily the consequence of a translational block. PCBP1 also blocked AR translation in a cell-free system, although this did not require binding to the 3'-untranslated region of the receptor mRNA. Furthermore, knockdown of PCBP1 in the prostate cancer LNCaP cell line also increased AR protein. Therefore, PCBP1 plays a major role in the dynamic expression of AR in both male and female androgen-responsive cells. ;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

Differences in content uniformity of the powders were measured by comparing samples from regions at different depths between the upper exposed powder surface and the base of the cylindrical container. Ordered mixes containing recrystallized lactose excipient and fine-particle potassium chloride as a model drug were found to be least susceptible to segregation at most vibration conditions for all potassium chloride concentrations. Dipac excipient/potassium chloride particles were most susceptible to segregation under all test conditions. In general, segregation intensity was most marked in conditions where high potassium chloride concentrations, above 2% w/w, were subjected to low-frequency vibration, below 100 Hz. Segregation mechanisms were considered to be mainly dependent on vibration conditions, although carrier excipient type markedly modified mechanisms and influenced segregation intensity.;-;-;-;hard_0

After a retrospective study concerning 109 cases and 178 ureteral reimplantations, the authors propose the selective indications for each technique noting the most important results.

We conclude that in ureterodigestive reimplantation, Leduc-Camey modified method is indicated. In renal transplantation, Lich-Gregoir is the ideal technique.

3950;11222512;Lacrimal drainage-associated lymphoid tissue (LDALT): a part of the human mucosal immune system.;Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) specifically protects mucosal surfaces. In a previous study of the human conjunctiva, evidence was also found for the presence of MALT in the lacrimal sac. The present study, therefore, aims to investigate its morphology and topographical distribution in the human lacrimal drainage system. Lacrimal drainage systems (n = 51) obtained from human cadavers were investigated by clearing flat wholemounts or by serial sections of tissue embedded in paraffin, OCT compound, or epoxy resin. These were further analyzed by histology, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. All specimens showed the presence of lymphocytes and plasma cells as a diffuse lymphoid tissue in the lamina propria, together with intraepithelial lymphocytes and occasional high endothelial venules (HEV). It formed a narrow layer along the canaliculi that became thicker in the cavernous parts. The majority of lymphocytes were T cells, whereas B cells were interspersed individually or formed follicular centers. T cells were positive for CD8 and the human mucosa lymphocyte antigen (HML-1). Most plasma cells were positive for IgA and the overlying epithelium expressed its transporter molecule secretory component (SC). Basal mucous glands were present in the lacrimal canaliculi and in the other parts accompanied by alveolar and acinar glands, all producing IgA-rich secretions. Primary and secondary lymphoid follicles possessing HEV were present in about half of the specimens. The term lacrimal drainage-associated lymphoid tissue (LDALT) is proposed here to describe the lymphoid tissue that is regularly present and belongs to the common mucosal immune system and to the secretory immune system. It is suggested that it may form a functional unit together with the lacrimal gland and conjunctiva, connected by tear flow, lymphocyte recirculation, and probably the neural reflex arc, and play a major role in preserving ocular surface integrity. ;polyalanine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
3951;16920481;The rat macrophage scavenger receptor CD163: expression, regulation and role in inflammatory mediator production.;The monoclonal antibody ED2 is widely used to define macrophages (mphi) in the rat. We have recently identified the ED2 antigen as the rat CD163 glycoprotein. CD163 is a member of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich group B (SRCR-B) family and functions as a scavenger receptor for hemoglobin-haptoglobin complexes. Moreover, CD163 has also been indicated as a marker for alternatively activated mphi. In the current study, we identify rat CD163/ED2-antigen as a marker for mature tissue mphi. Rat CD163 is constitutively expressed on most subpopulations of mature tissue mphi, including splenic red pulp mphi, thymic cortical mphi, Kupffer cells in the liver, resident bone marrow mphi and central nervous system perivascular and meningeal mphi, but is apparently absent from monocytes. Rat CD163 expression can be promoted by glucocorticoids, and this can be further enhanced by IL4. Finally, engagement of rat CD163 on peritoneal mphi induces the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, including NO, IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha. Collectively, our findings identify rat CD163 as a broadly expressed macrophage scavenger receptor that may play a role in the activation of mphi during hemolytic and/or inflammatory conditions. ;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
3952;6407789;Plasma contamination accounts for thyroid hormone binding in nuclear protein extracts from human mononuclear cells.;"Plasma protein contamination accounted for high affinity thyroid hormone binding to a nuclear protein extract from human blood mononuclear cells. The degree of contamination was directly related to the number of times the cells were washed before the nuclear protein was extracted. After three washes, no specific binding was detected. Plasma contamination was estimated to be 0.3-0.5 microliter/assay tube. The TBG concentration in this volume of plasma was consistent with the concentration of 0.2 micrograms/ml measured by RIA in the nuclear extract. Total specific binding of [125I] T4 and [125I] T3 can be attributed to plasma contamination, as 0.3 microliter of plasma gave identical binding. Furthermore, a TBG antiserum abolished specific T4 and T3 binding to the nuclear protein extract. These data are consistent with TBG being the major plasma contaminant. In fourteen normal, euthyroid subjects, the higher mean maximum binding capacity (MBC) for T4 (1.63 +/- 0.27 SD) compared to T3 (0.25 +/- 0.21 pmol/mg protein; P less than 0.001) and the same binding affinity (Ka, 2.0 +/- 0.7 x 10(9)/mol) for both T4 and T3 are the same as found in plasma. The higher MBC for T4 (5.8 +/- 1.0) and T3 (0.69 +/- 0.2 pmol/mg protein) in two hypothyroid subjects are consistent with the higher mean TBG concentration of 28 +/- 5 micrograms/ml compared to the level in ten normal subjects (19.2 +/- 1.8 micrograms/ml; P less than 0.001). In two subjects with low normal TBG concentrations of 15 micrograms/ml, the T4 maximum specific binding of 9% was lower than found in normal subjects 16.6 +/- 7.6%. We conclude that the methodology described previously and used in this study is invalid for measuring thyroid hormone nuclear receptor status in humans.";-;-;-;hard_0
3954;16598824;Molecular characterization of polyphosphate (PolyP) operon from Serratia marcescens.;The polyphosphate (polyP) operon was cloned from a genomic library of Serratia marcescens KCTC 2172 by Southern hybridization using E. coli ppk gene as a probe. The polyP operon was composed of a polyphosphate promoter, polyphosphate kinase (ppk) and exopolyphosphatase (ppx). A potential CRP binding site and pho box sequence were found in the region upstream of the putative promoter in the regulatory region. The ppk gene comprises 2,063 nucleotides and encodes 686 amino acids yielding a protein with a molecular mass of 70 kDa. The ppx gene contains 1611 nucleotides and encodes 536 amino acids with a molecular 58 kDa. An E. coli strain transformed with the ppk gene had a 16-fold increased in polyphosphate kinase activity, while introduction of the ppx gene produced a 25-fold increase in polyphosphatase activity. E. coli strains transformed with ppk and ppx genes also displayed increased accumulation of polyphosphate. ;polyproline;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
3958;8141303;Effect of brefeldin A on lymphatic triacylglycerol transport in the rat.;Brefeldin A (BFA) has been shown in in vitro studies to either collapse the Golgi into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or the peripheral organelles into the trans-Golgi network. Our goal was to determine the effect of BFA on intestinal lipid transport, since the Golgi is thought to play an important role in this process and simultaneously establish the effectiveness of BFA in an in vivo system. We infused rats intraduodenally with glyceryl tri-[3H]oleate at 135 mumol/h for 15 h and included BFA, 750 micrograms/h, during hours 4-7 of infusion. Mass and lipid disintegrations per minute output into the lymph fell to 9% of input rates at 8 h of infusion and returned to steady-state values at 12 h of infusion. Both chylomicron and very low-density lipoprotein output were severely affected by the BFA. Electron microscopy showed that the Golgi was collapsed into the ER. Mucosal triacylglycerol (TG) mass and disintegrations per minute were increased at 7 h of infusion in BFA infused rats vs. controls in the proximal half of the intestine. Lipid absorption, lipase activity, and mucosal TG synthesis were normal in the BFA-treated rats. We conclude that BFA works in vivo and in the intestine collapses the Golgi into the ER. As a consequence, lymphatic TG transport was severely affected.;-;-;-;hard_0

The images of the films obtained at various protein concentrations in the water subphase and different values of surface pressure were captured. The topology of the surface covered by one or three layers of the films studied was investigated. It is shown that at a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml in the water subphase, the films are composed of aggregated protein molecules, and their structure has an insular character. An increase in the number of transferred layers up to three results in a virtually complete covering of the surface. A decrease in the protein concentration in the water subphase to 1 microgram/ml enabled us to prepare films consisting of individual non-aggregated protein molecules.;-;-;-;hard_0
3968;1708014;Mitogenesis in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells from two rat models of hypertension in response to fetal calf serum and angiotensin II.;"Hypertension may result from vascular hypertrophy or hyperplasia due to enhanced growth of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), which has been demonstrated in VSMCs from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) compared to Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. To determine whether this enhanced mitogenesis is peculiar to SHRs or a general phenomenon in genetic models of hypertension, we have measured indices of cell growth [3H]-thymidine uptake in VSMCs from SHRs and New Zealand genetically hypertensive (GH) rats and controls [WKY and normal Wistar (N) rats] cultured in fetal calf serum (FCS) or angiotensin II (Ang II, 0.1 microM) in either 3% heat-treated FCS or serum-free medium. SHR cell numbers increased faster in response to both mitogens compared to WKY rats. However, GH and N rat responses to FCS were the same. Ang II caused a significant but similar increase in cell numbers in both GH and N rat cells (i.e., Ang II caused hyperplasia in all four strains) but [3H]thymidine uptake was significantly greater in GH rat cells. Ang II increased the total well protein content but not protein normalized on cell number, i.e., no hypertrophic effect of Ang II was seen in these actively dividing cells. We conclude that (a) growth properties of VSMCs from rats with genetic hypertension vary between strains; the differences in growth may reflect strain-specific variation in the activity of intracellular signalling systems subserving mitogenesis; and (b) Ang II causes VSMC hyperplasia.";-;-;-;hard_0
3971;6042356;Metabolic processes in cytoplasmic particles of the avocado fruit. IX. The oxidation of pyruvate and malate during the climacteric cycle.;Mitochondria isolated from preclimacteric avocado fruit oxidize pyruvate at a much lower rate than those separated from climacteric fruit. The external addition of thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) increased the rate of pyruvate oxidation in both cases. The study of the influence of TPP on the rate of oxidation of malate by mitochondria obtained from both preclimacteric and climacteric fruit indicated that the effect of this cofactor could be understood by assuming that malate was converted to pyruvate. TPP stimulation of malate oxidation was prevented by arsenite, an inhibitor of keto acid oxidation. The addition of glutamate increased the rate of malate oxidation through the transamination of oxaloacetate. This suggests that the rate of oxidation of malate is highly dependent upon mechanisms which remove oxaloacetate efficiently. Incubation of mitochondria from preclimacteric fruit with malate-U-(14)C resulted in the labeling of oxaloacetate and the accumulation of labeled pyruvate. Addition of TPP to this system induced the rapid formation of citrate. This conversion was completely inhibited by arsenite. The results indicate that the ability to carry out the oxidative decarboxylation of alpha-ketoacids improves as the ripening process progresses. The idea was advanced that TPP available to the mitochondria plays an important controlling role.;-;-;-;hard_0

One hundred of the sequence markers have strong similarities to known genes. Many overlaps were also checked using restriction fingerprint analysis. This map is an important step in the elucidation of the sequence of the entire genome of Pyrobaculum aerophilum.

3983;35565433;MEOX2 Regulates the Growth and Survival of Glioblastoma Stem Cells by Modulating Genes of the Glycolytic Pathway and Response to Hypoxia.;The most widely accepted hypothesis for the development of glioblastoma suggests that glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) are crucially involved in tumor initiation and recurrence as well as in the occurrence of chemo- and radio-resistance. Mesenchyme homeobox 2 (MEOX2) is a transcription factor overexpressed in glioblastoma, whose expression is negatively correlated with patient survival. Starting from our observation that MEOX2 expression is strongly enhanced in six GSC lines, we performed shRNA-mediated knock-down experiments in two different GSC lines and found that MEOX2 depletion resulted in the inhibition of cell growth and sphere-forming ability and an increase in apoptotic cell death. By a deep transcriptome analysis, we identified a core group of genes modulated in response to MEOX2 knock-down. Among these genes, the repressed ones are largely enriched in genes involved in the hypoxic response and glycolytic pathway, two strictly related pathways that contribute to the resistance of high-grade gliomas to therapies. An in silico study of the regulatory regions of genes differentially expressed by MEOX2 knock-down revealed that they mainly consisted of GC-rich regions enriched for Sp1 and Klf4 binding motifs, two main regulators of metabolism in glioblastoma. Our results show, for the first time, the involvement of MEOX2 in the regulation of genes of GSC metabolism, which is essential for the survival and growth of these cells.;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
3985;8381673;Selective modification of Sendai virus hemagglutinin neuraminidase by pyridoxal 5'-phosphate: evidence for an allosteric modulation of neuraminidase activity.;Incubation of Sendai virus with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) causes inhibition of hemolytic activity, a slight reduction of hemagglutinating activity, and an increase in neuraminidase activity. The effects on hemagglutination and neuraminidase are prevented by the presence in the incubation mixture of sialyl lactose, a substrate of hemagglutinin-neuraminidase. Incubation with PLP of the water-soluble enzymatic domain of the neuraminidase has no effect on enzymatic activity, while the allosteric inhibition (Dallocchio et al. (1991) Biochem. Int. 25, 663-668) disappears. Both virus-bound and solubilized neuraminidase are selectively modified by PLP at the lysine-553.

3986;8923968;Comparison of four methods for isolating large mRNA: apolipoprotein B mRNA in bovine and rat livers.;The effectiveness of four methods for isolating large-size mRNA (14 kb) encoding for hepatic bovine apoprotein B (apo B) was compared. Total RNA of liver (positive controls) and lung (negative controls) samples taken in bovine and rat was extracted using the methods of Chirgwin et al., Chomczynski and Sacchi, Cathala et al., and RNAzol. The integrity of total RNA extracted by the four methods was demonstrated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel and staining with ethidium bromide.

3989;1324834;Control of human coagulation by recombinant serine proteases. Blood clotting is activated by recombinant factor XII deleted of five regulatory domains.;The availability of engineered serine proteases allows one to study the activation, substrate specificity and regulation of human coagulation and fibrinolytic activities. Human coagulation factor XII is composed of the protease catalytic region at the C-terminus, a hinge proline-rich region and regulatory domains at the N-terminus. From cDNA clones coding for factor XII, two DNA molecules were constructed, one being full length and the other being deleted of exons coding for the regulatory domains. Engineered factor-XII cDNA species were inserted by a homologous recombination technique into vaccinia viruses, which were used to infect the human hepatoma cell line HepG2. Two recombinant proteins were prepared from the culture media and identified by their antigenic properties and electrophoretic mobilities. The recombinant protein of larger size was identified as the full-length factor XII of 80 kDa and its specific activities and activation patterns, determined both by the coagulation and the amidolytic assays, are very similar to these of native human factor XII. The recombinant protein of smaller size was identified as a 319-amino-acid-deleted factor-XII protein of 32 kDa, containing only the entire protease region and part of the proline-rich hinge. This protein was expected to be the 'minimal' portion of factor XII able to sustain protease but unable to recognize substrates and surfaces necessary to activate the contact phase of coagulation. However, this 'minimal' factor-XII protein displays a marked protease activity and, although lacking five regulatory domains of factor XII, is bound and activated by negative charges and promotes coagulation with high efficiency.;polyproline;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
3991;11812777;Non-sequence-specific DNA binding by the FILAMENTOUS FLOWER protein from Arabidopsis thaliana is reduced by EDTA.;The FILAMENTOUS FLOWER protein has a zinc finger domain, hydrophobic region, proline-rich region, and a HMG box-like domain. We have reported that zinc release at the zinc finger is probably facilitated by the non-canonical cysteine residue at position 56, and that EDTA causes the structural change and enhances the self-assembly of the protein (Kanaya, E., Watanabe, K., Nakajima, N., Okada, K., and Shimura, Y. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 7383-7390). To investigate this aspect further we examined the DNA binding function of the FILAMENTOUS FLOWER protein. Gel retardation experiments showed that the FILAMENTOUS FLOWER protein binds to DNA without sequence specificity. Deletion analyses suggested that the zinc finger domain and the hydrophobic region are not required but the proline-rich region and the HMG box-like domain are indispensable for the DNA binding by the FILAMENTOUS FLOWER protein. The DNA binding by the protein consisting of the zinc finger domain and the rest of the regions was reduced with the addition of EDTA. This result probably suggests that the zinc release, the structural change probably occurring in the zinc finger domain, the intermolecular interaction, and the self-assembly of the protein are related to the dissociation of the FILAMENTOUS FLOWER protein from DNA. ;polyproline;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function

3995;17940278;Sumoylation-dependent control of homotypic and heterotypic synergy by the Kruppel-type zinc finger protein ZBP-89.;The Krüppel-like transcription factor ZBP-89 is a sequence-specific regulator that plays key roles in cellular growth and differentiation especially in endodermal and germ cell lineages. ZBP-89 shares with other members of the Sp-like family an overlapping sequence specificity for GC-rich sequences in the regulatory regions of multiple genes. Defining the mechanisms that govern the intrinsic function of ZBP-89 as well as its competitive and non-competitive functional interactions with other regulators is central to understand how ZBP-89 exerts its biological functions. We now describe that post-translational modification of ZBP-89 by multiple small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) isoforms occurs at two conserved synergy control motifs flanking the DNA binding domain. Functionally sumoylation did not directly alter the ability of ZBP-89 to compete with other Sp-like factors from individual sites. At promoters bearing multiple response elements, however, this modification inhibited the functional cooperation between ZBP-89 and Sp1. Analysis of the properties of ZBP-89 in cellular contexts devoid of competing factors indicated that although on its own it behaves as a modest activator it potently synergizes with heterologous activators such as the glucocorticoid receptor. Notably we found that when conjugated to ZBP-89, SUMO exerts a strong inhibitory effect on such synergistic interactions through a critical conserved functional surface. By regulating higher order functional interactions, sumoylation provides a reversible post-translational mechanism to control the activity of ZBP-89. ;polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

The comparative development of these 3 parameters was followed from days 30 to 90. A detailed morphological system of classification was established covering both individual and multiple abnormalities. At puberty, the first spermatozoa to appear were few in number, showed poor motility and were extremely atypical. Subsequently, the number of atypically-shaped spermatozoa diminished, and their concentration and motility exhibited parallel increases. At 60 days, the values for these 3 parameters and the proportions of normal and abnormal spermatozoa became stable.

Administration of SNL glycoprotein inhibited phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), expression of colonic proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and frequency of colonic ACF in DMH-stimulated mice colon carcinogenesis. In addition, SNL glycoprotein increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (p21(WAF/Cip1) and p27(Kip1)), whereas reduced expression of precursor form of apoptosis-related proteins [pro-caspase-3 and pro-poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP)] in the mice. Interestingly, the results in this study revealed that SNL glycoprotein has suppressive effects on activity of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB), whereas it has stimulatory effect on the expression of p53, accompanying inhibitory effects on expression of NF-kappaBp50, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in DMH-stimulated ACF formation. Also, SNL glycoprotein has inhibitory effects on the formation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), on the production of inducible nitric oxide (NO), and on the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the mice plasma. Collectively, our findings in this study suggest that SNL glycoprotein has chemopreventive activity via modulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis in DMH-treated A/J mice. ;polyproline;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
4007;8114729;Importance of a flanking AT-rich region in target site recognition by the GC box-binding zinc finger protein MIG1.;MIG1 is a zinc finger protein that mediates glucose repression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. MIG1 is related to the mammalian Krox/Egr, Wilms' tumor, and Sp1 finger proteins. It has two fingers and binds to a GCGGGG motif that resembles the GC boxes recognized by these mammalian proteins. We have performed a complete saturation mutagenesis of a natural MIG1 site in order to elucidate its binding specificity. We found that only three mutations within the GC box retain the ability to bind MIG1: G1 to C, C2 to T, and G5 to A. This result is consistent with current models for zinc finger-DNA binding, which assume that the sequence specificity is determined by base triplet recognition within the GC box. Surprisingly, we found that an AT-rich region 5' to the GC box also is important for MIG1 binding. This AT box is present in all natural MIG1 sites, and it is protected by MIG1 in DNase I footprints. However, the AT box differs from the GC box in that no single base within it is essential for binding. Instead, the AT-rich nature of this sequence seems to be crucial. The fact that AT-rich sequences are known to increase DNA flexibility prompted us to test whether MIG1 bends DNA. We found that binding of MIG1 is associated with bending within the AT box. We conclude that DNA binding by a simple zinc finger protein such as MIG1 can involve both recognition of the GC box and flanking sequence preferences that may reflect local DNA bendability. ;polythreonine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function

4011;6727581;Manifestations of nonsuppurative cholangitis in chronic hepatobiliary diseases: morphologic spectrum, clinical correlations and terminology.;"The features of nonsuppurative cholangitis were studied in liver biopsy specimens from 185 patients with chronic active hepatitis (CAH), 280 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), and 55 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Specimens from patients with other liver diseases in which the presence of nonsuppurative cholangitis had been recorded were also studied. We identified four types of nonsuppurative cholangitis: granulomatous cholangitis, lymphoid cholangitis, fibrous cholangitis, and pleomorphic cholangitis. Granulomatous cholangitis almost always seemed to be destructive; the other types were either destructive or nondestructive. Granulomatous cholangitis was, for all practical purposes, diagnostic of PBC and the obliterative form of fibrous cholangitis was similarly diagnostic for the hepatic manifestations of PSC in adults and paucity of intrahepatic bile ducts in infants. All other types of cholangitis were found in CAH, PBC, PSC, and other liver diseases. Thus, the term ""nonsuppurative cholangitis"" describes a spectrum of morphologic lesions that differ in incidence, morphogenesis, usefulness for liver biopsy diagnosis, and, probably, pathogenesis.";-;-;-;hard_0
4012;26926106;The STAR protein QKI-7 recruits PAPD4 to regulate post-transcriptional polyadenylation of target mRNAs.;Emerging evidence has demonstrated that regulating the length of the poly(A) tail on an mRNA is an efficient means of controlling gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. In early development, transcription is silenced and gene expression is primarily regulated by cytoplasmic polyadenylation. In somatic cells, considerable progress has been made toward understanding the mechanisms of negative regulation by deadenylation. However, positive regulation through elongation of the poly(A) tail has not been widely studied due to the difficulty in distinguishing whether any observed increase in length is due to the synthesis of new mRNA, reduced deadenylation or cytoplasmic polyadenylation. Here, we overcame this barrier by developing a method for transcriptional pulse-chase analysis under conditions where deadenylases are suppressed. This strategy was used to show that a member of the Star family of RNA binding proteins, QKI, promotes polyadenylation when tethered to a reporter mRNA. Although multiple RNA binding proteins have been implicated in cytoplasmic polyadenylation during early development, previously only CPEB was known to function in this capacity in somatic cells. Importantly, we show that only the cytoplasmic isoform QKI-7 promotes poly(A) tail extension, and that it does so by recruiting the non-canonical poly(A) polymerase PAPD4 through its unique carboxyl-terminal region. We further show that QKI-7 specifically promotes polyadenylation and translation of three natural target mRNAs (hnRNPA1, p27(kip1)and β-catenin) in a manner that is dependent on the QKI response element. An anti-mitogenic signal that induces cell cycle arrest at G1 phase elicits polyadenylation and translation of p27(kip1)mRNA via QKI and PAPD4. Taken together, our findings provide significant new insight into a general mechanism for positive regulation of gene expression by post-transcriptional polyadenylation in somatic cells.  ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
4013;30790668;State-Dependent Spike and Local Field Synchronization between the Thalamic Parafascicular Nucleus and the Dorsal Striatum in a Rat Model of Parkinson's Disease.;Recent studies on the impact of Parkinson's disease (PD) on the thalamostriatal pathway have mainly focused on the structural and functional changes in the thalamus projection to the striatum. Alterations in the electrophysiological activity of the thalamostriatal circuit in PD have not been intensively studied. To further investigate this circuit, parafascicular nucleus (PF) single-unit spikes and dorsal striatum local field potential (LFP) activities were simultaneously recorded in control and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats during inattentive rest or treadmill walking states. We classified the PF neurons into two predominant subtypes (PF I and PF II). During rest state, after dopamine loss, increased PF I spike and striatal LFP coherence was observed in the beta-frequency (12-35 Hz), with changed PF I neuronal firing pattern and unchanged firing rates of the two neuron subtypes. However, in a treadmill walking state, PF II neurons displayed markedly increased coherence to striatal beta oscillations in the dopamine-depleted rats, as well as an altered PF II neuronal firing pattern and significantly decreased firing rates of the two neuron subtypes. The results indicate that in PD animals, state transition from rest to moving, such as treadmill walking, is associated with different PF neuron types and increased spike-LFP synchronization, which may provide new paradigms for understanding and treating PD.;-;-;-;hard_0
4015;8969230;Identification of a novel cis-acting element participating in maximal induction of the human low density lipoprotein receptor gene transcription in response to low cellular cholesterol levels.;In this paper, we present both in vivo and in vitro evidence for the presence of a novel cis-acting regulatory element that is required for maximal induction of the human low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene following depletion of cellular sterols in HepG2 cells. First, in vivo dimethyl sulfate footprinting of the human LDL receptor promoter before and after transcriptional induction in HepG2 cells revealed protection from -145 to -126, 5'-GAGCTTCACGGGTTAAAAAG-3' (referred to as FP1 site). Second, transient transfections of HepG2 cells with promoter luciferase reporter constructs containing the FP1 site resulted in significant enhancement (approximately 375%) of reporter gene expression in response to low levels of sterols compared with parallel plasmid without the FP1 site. In addition, this response was markedly attenuated on nucleotide substitutions within the FP1 site. Third, by electrophoretic mobility shift assays, the FP1 sequence was found to bind protein(s) from HepG2 nuclear extracts in a sequence-specific manner. In vitro binding of the FP1 mutants paralleled the results obtained for their in vivo transcription. On the basis of competition profiles, the FP1-binding factor is different from the known transcription factors binding to the AT-rich CArG and GArC motifs. Furthermore, the FP1-binding protein is not specific to HepG2 cells because nuclear factor(s) with the same specificity was observed in nuclear extracts of non-hepatic HeLa cells. We conclude that transcriptional induction of the LDL receptor gene in response to sterol depletion is mediated, in part, by an highly conserved novel cis-acting element through the binding of specific nuclear protein(s).;polythreonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
4016;9408733;A review of epidemiologic studies of triazine herbicides and cancer.;We evaluated epidemiologic evidence pertaining to the human carcinogenic potential of triazine herbicides in general and of atrazine, the most common triazine. Cancers for which data are available included non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, leukemia, multiple myeloma, soft tissue sarcoma, colon cancer, and ovarian cancer. The investigations had methodologic limitations, including lack of in-depth exposure measurements and small numbers of subjects with heavy exposure and/or with many years since starting exposure, possibly required for the induction of cancer. The relation between triazines and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been assessed in four independent population-based case-control studies, reporting odds ratios ranging from 1.2 to 2.5. However, chance and/or confounding by other agricultural exposures may have produced these weak statistical associations. Furthermore, a pooled analysis of three of the case-control studies and the combined analysis of two retrospective follow-up studies did not demonstrate the types of dose-response or induction time patterns that would be expected if triazines were causal factors. The epidemiologic data pertaining to Hodgkin's disease, leukemia, multiple myeloma, soft tissue sarcoma, colon cancer, and ovarian cancer were inadequate for determining whether associations with atrazine or triazines exist in humans. For each of these cancers, only one or two studies evaluating the relationship were available, and the results of the studies typically were imprecise.;-;-;-;hard_0
4019;19415755;Prediction of protein-glucose binding sites using support vector machines.;Glucose is a simple sugar that plays an essential role in many basic metabolic and signaling pathways. Many proteins have binding sites that are highly specific to glucose. The exponential increase of genomic data has revealed the identity of many proteins that seem to be central to biological processes, but whose exact functions are unknown. Many of these proteins seem to be associated with disease processes. Being able to predict glucose-specific binding sites in these proteins will greatly enhance our ability to annotate protein function and may significantly contribute to drug design. We hereby present the first glucose-binding site classifier algorithm. We consider the sugar-binding pocket as a spherical spatio-chemical environment and represent it as a vector of geometric and chemical features. We then perform Random Forests feature selection to identify key features and analyze them using support vector machines classification. Our work shows that glucose binding sites can be modeled effectively using a limited number of basic chemical and residue features. Using a leave-one-out cross-validation method, our classifier achieves a 8.11% error, a 89.66% sensitivity and a 93.33% specificity over our dataset. From a biochemical perspective, our results support the relevance of ordered water molecules and ions in determining glucose specificity. They also reveal the importance of carboxylate residues in glucose binding and the high concentration of negatively charged atoms in direct contact with the bound glucose molecule.;-;-;-;hard_0
4021;1321810;Identification and characterization of two enhancers of the human albumin gene.;A 12.5-kilobase pair (kb) segment upstream of the human albumin gene was analyzed for transcription enhancing activity using transient transfection analysis, gel mobility shift assays, DNase I footprinting, and site-specific mutagenesis. Two enhancer regions were identified, one 1.7 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site (E1.7) and the other 6 kb upstream (E6). In E1.7, a nuclear protein from HuH-7 hepatoma cells binds to an AT-rich sequence, GTTACTAATTGAC. Competition gel mobility shift assays suggested that this protein is HNF-1, which regulates the promoter of the albumin gene and several other liver-specific genes. A 60-base pair E1.7 fragment carrying the AT-rich sequence stimulates a heterologous (alpha-fetoprotein) promoter in a dose-dependent manner. In E6, a HuH-7 nuclear protein binds to a GT-rich sequence, TGTTTGGC.A 27-base pair E6 fragment carrying this sequence is able to stimulate the SV40 promoter in an orientation-independent manner. An alteration of this sequence by site-specific mutagenesis resulted in the loss of transcriptional activity as well as binding to the HuH-7 nuclear protein. Competition gel mobility shift assays showed that homologous elements exist in the albumin promoter. These results show that the promoter and enhancer of the human albumin gene are regulated by two common transcription factors through two shared cis-acting elements, one AT-rich and the other GT-rich. ;polythreonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

4025;9146532;Laboratory tests and imaging studies in patients with cutaneous malignant melanomas: a survey of experienced physicians.;"BACKGROUND
The presence or absence of metastases is important in determining prognosis and treatment options for patients with malignant melanoma (MM). Laboratory tests and imaging studies are ordered for patients with MMs but without symptoms in an effort to detect occult metastases. However, which laboratory tests and imaging studies to order and how often to reorder them is not well established.


OBJECTIVE
Our purpose was to determine which tests and studies are ordered by physicians with major responsibilities for the care of patients with MM.


METHODS
Physicians were surveyed by questionnaire about the laboratory tests and imaging studies they ordered for MM stages 0, I, II, and III.


RESULTS
Of the 35 physicians queried, 30 (86%) responded to the survey. The majority of physicians order tests as follows: no tests for MM in situ; roentgenography of the chest with or without initial lactic acid dehydrogenase/liver function tests for stages I, II, and III and during follow-up for stages IB, II, and III (more frequently as the Breslow thickness increases); and baseline computed tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging scans of the chest, abdomen/pelvis, and brain for stage III.


CONCLUSION
Although the pattern of ordering examinations was similar for the majority of respondents, there was significant variability among experienced physicians in ordering laboratory tests and imaging studies in the search for occult metastases in patients with asymptomatic MM. The laboratory tests and imaging studies ordered and their frequency depend on the stage of the MM and sometimes on other risk factors.";-;-;-;hard_0
4026;8055353;Local injections of excitatory amino acid agonists alter the glutamatergic and dopaminergic transmissions in the rat striatum.;This study examined the effects of kainic, ibotenic, and quisqualic acid-induced lesions of the rat striatum on biochemical markers of the glutamatergic corticostriatal and dopaminergic nigrostriatal afferent transmissions. Fifteen to 21 days after striatal injections of these various compounds, significant reductions in the high-affinity glutamate uptake rate, due to decreases in the Vmax of the transport process, were measured. Interestingly, the relationship between these decreases in the Vmax and the decreases in the levels of biochemical markers for the intrinsic striatal cholinergic and GABAergic neurons differed depending on the excitotoxin used. These findings suggest that excitatory amino acid agonists-induced alterations of the glutamatergic terminal activity may not depend only on the loss of cholinergic and GABAergic striatal neurons. In contrast, the observed changes in the dopamine and metabolite contents seemed to be related to the extent of the striatal neuronal degeneration induced by each excitotoxin. All in all, these results indicate that excitatory amino acid agonists can impair the activity and/or the integrity of the two main striatal afferent pathways, through presumably different mechanisms.;-;-;-;hard_0

4029;11751933;Both DNA and histone fold sequences contribute to archaeal nucleosome stability.;The roles and interdependence of DNA sequence and archaeal histone fold structure in determining archaeal nucleosome stability and positioning have been determined and quantitated. The presence of four tandem copies of TTTAAAGCCG in the polylinker region of pLITMUS28 resulted in a DNA molecule with increased affinity (DeltaDeltaG of approximately 700 cal mol(-1)) for the archaeal histone HMfB relative to the polylinker sequence, and the dominant, quantitative contribution of the helical repeats of the dinucleotide TA to this increased affinity has been established. The rotational and translational positioning of archaeal nucleosomes assembled on the (TTTAAAGCCG)(4) sequence and on DNA molecules selectively incorporated into archaeal nucleosomes by HMfB have been determined. Alternating A/T- and G/C-rich regions were located where the minor and major grooves, respectively, sequentially faced the archaeal nucleosome core, and identical positioning results were obtained using HMfA, a closely related archaeal histone also from Methanothermus fervidus. However, HMfA did not have similarly high affinities for the HMfB-selected DNA molecules, and domain-swap experiments have shown that this difference in affinity is determined by residue differences in the C-terminal region of alpha-helix 3 of the histone fold, a region that is not expected to directly interact with DNA. Rather this region is thought to participate in forming the histone dimer:dimer interface at the center of an archaeal nucleosome histone tetramer core. If differences in this interface do result in archaeal histone cores with different sequence preferences, then the assembly of alternative archaeal nucleosome tetramer cores could provide an unanticipated and novel structural mechanism to regulate gene expression. ;polycysteine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
4030;1915274;The oct3 gene, a gene for an embryonic transcription factor, is controlled by a retinoic acid repressible enhancer.;Oct3 is an embryonic octamer-binding transcription factor, whose expression is rapidly repressed by retinoic acid (RA). In this report, we have determined the transcriptional control region of the oct3 gene and studied the mechanism of the RA-mediated repression. The chromosomal oct3 gene consists of five exons. Three subdomains of the POU region and transactivating domain are located in separate exons. Transcription initiates at multiple sites in the GC-rich region lacking a typical TATA box. The upstream 2 kb region can confer the cell type-specific expression and RA-mediated repression. Analysis of the upstream region by deletion mutagenesis locates a cis element (RARE1) which functions as a stem cell-specific, yet RA-repressible, enhancer. Footprint and gel-retardation assays show that RARE1 is composed of two domains, each of which is recognized by distinct factors. Microinjection of oct3-lacZ constructs into fertilized eggs indicates that RARE1 can function in early embryos. We suggest that RARE1 is a critical cis element for oct3 gene expression in embryonic stem cells and for the RA-mediated repression. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

When either all twin pairs, or only monozygotic or dizygotic twin pairs, were considered, no significant differences were found in the quarter of birth between the 3 groups. No difference in quarter of birth was found for twin pairs concordant versus discordant for schizophrenia. Despite the increased risk for intrauterine and perinatal complications in twin births, schizophrenic twins appear (at least) to be no more vulnerable than schizophrenic singletons to the seasonal gestation and birth-related insults which probably underlie the seasonality in schizophrenic births.

4040;7681043;Identification of antigenic epitopes in an alanine-rich repeating region of a surface protein antigen of Streptococcus mutants.;A surface protein antigen (PAc) of Streptococcus mutans with a molecular mass of 190 kDa is considered to play an important role in the initial attachment of this streptococcus to the tooth surface. Two internal repeating amino acid sequences are present in the PAc molecule. One repeating region located in the N-terminal region is rich in alanine (A-region), and the other, located in the central region, is rich in proline (P-region). To identify antigenic epitopes on the A-region of the PAc protein, 82 sequential overlapping synthetic decapeptides covering one of the repetitive units of the A-region were synthesized. In the epitope scanning analyses using murine antisera raised against recombinant PAc (rPAc), multiple antigenic epitopes were found in the repetitive unit of the A-region, and some of them reacted with antisera to rPAc from BALB/c, B10, B10.D2, and B10.BR mice. In particular, a peptide YEAALKQY (residues 366 to 373) was recognized by anti-rPAc sera from all four strains of mice. The reactivities of anti-rPAc sera in the epitope scanning were confirmed by using a purified synthetic peptide, NAKATYEAALKQYEADLAA (corresponding to residues 361 to 379). Furthermore, antisera against a surface protein antigen PAg (SpaA) of Streptococcus sobrinus from BALB/c mice reacted strongly to residues 330 to 337, 362 to 369, and 366 to 373 of the PAc protein by the epitope scanning analysis. An AKATYEAALKQY (residues 362 to 373 of the PAc protein)-like sequence, AKANYEAKLAQY, was found within the A-region of S. sobrinus PAg, suggesting that the amino acid sequences AKA-YEA and YEA-L-QY may be major cross-reactive epitopes of the S. mutans PAc protein and the S. sobrinus PAg protein. ;polyalanine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
4041;9107533;Erythrocyte membrane alterations in Plasmodium falciparum malaria sequestration.;Plasmodium falciparum malaria, the most lethal form of human malaria, claims at least 2 million lives worldwide each year. Recently, there has been a significant advance in our understanding of the molecular basis of P. falciparum sequestration, a distinctive pathologic feature that often leads to fatal human cerebral malaria. Parasite-derived VAR proteins (Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocyte membrane protein 1) have been cloned and identified as antigenically diverse cytoadherent receptors localized to the knob protrusions that act as attachment points in parasite sequestration. Evidence now supports the hypothesis that cryptic regions of band 3 protein are parasite-induced, host-derived erythrocyte receptors mediating parasite sequestration. Knob structures have been localized to spectrin-actin-protein 4.1 junctions in intact spread membrane skeletons. A recombinant domain of knob-associated histidine-rich protein, a major protein found in both membrane-intact and isolated knobs, has been shown to associate with filamentous actin and spectrin.

4045;10077000;Transition from monomeric to homodimeric DNA binding by nuclear receptors: identification of RevErbAalpha determinants required for RORalpha homodimer complex formation.;Nuclear hormone receptors belong to a class of transcription factors that recognize specific DNA sequences either as monomers, homodimers, or heterodimers with the common partner retinoic X receptor. In vitro mutagenesis studies, as well as determination of the crystal structure of several complexes formed by the DNA-binding domain of receptors bound to their cognate response elements, have begun to explain the molecular basis for protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions essential for high-affinity and specific DNA binding by nuclear receptors. In this study, we have used the related orphan nuclear receptors, RORalpha and RevErbAalpha, to study the molecular determinants involved in the transition from monomeric to homodimeric modes of DNA binding by nuclear receptors. While both receptors bind DNA as monomers to a response element containing a core AGGTCA half-site preceded by a 5'-A/T-rich flanking sequence, RevErbAalpha also binds as a homodimer to an extended DR2 element. Gain-of-function experiments using point mutations and subdomain swaps between RORalpha and RevErbAalpha identify four amino acids within RevErbAalpha sufficient to confer RORalpha with the ability to form cooperative homodimer complexes on an extended DR2. This study reveals how the transition from monomer to homodimer DNA binding by members of the nuclear receptor superfamily could be achieved from relatively few amino acid substitutions. ;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
4047;34474475;Polyphosphate-induced thrombosis in mice is factor XII dependent and is attenuated by histidine-rich glycoprotein.;Histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) is an abundant plasma protein that binds factor XIIa (FXIIa) and inhibits factor XII (FXII) autoactivation and FXIIa-mediated activation of FXI. Polyphosphate (polyP), a potent procoagulant released from activated platelets, may serve as a physiological activator of the contact system. Previously, we showed that HRG binds DNA and neutralizes its procoagulant activity. Consequently, our goal was to determine whether the capacity of HRG to bind polyanions enables it to regulate polyP-induced thrombosis. In a plate-based assay, immobilized polyP bound HRG, FXII, and FXIIa in a zinc-dependent manner. Basal and polyP-induced thrombin generation was greater in plasma from HRG-deficient mice than in plasma from wild-type mice. Intraperitoneal injection of polyP shortened the activated partial thromboplastin time, enhanced thrombin generation, increased thrombin-antithrombin levels, reduced lung perfusion, and promoted pulmonary fibrin deposition to a greater extent in HRG-deficient mice than in wild-type mice, effects that were abrogated with FXII knockdown. HRG thus attenuates the procoagulant and prothrombotic effects of polyP in an FXII-dependent manner by modulating the contact system.;polyproline;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Here, we characterize a novel cysteine-rich domain which is crucial for sensing excess intracellular copper by dMTF-1. Transgenic flies expressing mutant dMTF-1 containing alanine substitutions of two, four or six cysteine residues within the sequence (547)CNCTNCKCDQTKSCHGGDC(565) are significantly or completely impaired in their ability to protect flies from copper toxicity and fail to up-regulate MtnA (metallothionein) expression in response to excess Cu. In contrast, these flies exhibit wild-type survival in response to copper deprivation thus revealing that the cysteine cluster domain is required only for sensing Cu load by dMTF-1. Parallel studies show that the isolated cysteine cluster domain is required to protect a copper-sensitive S. cerevisiae ace1Delta strain from copper toxicity. Cu(I) ligation by a Cys-rich domain peptide fragment drives the cooperative assembly of a polydentate [Cu(4)-S(6)] cage structure, characterized by a core of trigonally S(3) coordinated Cu(I) ions bound by bridging thiolate ligands. While reminiscent of Cu(4)-L(6) (L = ligand) tetranuclear clusters in copper regulatory transcription factors of yeast, the absence of significant sequence homology is consistent with convergent evolution of a sensing strategy particularly well suited for Cu(I). ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

Calculations at the B3LYP* level of theory reproduce well the energy gap between the Co(II-HS) and Co(III-LS) forms giving an energy gap of 4.4 kcal/mol, which is comparable to the experimental value of 8.9 kcal/mol. Potential energy surfaces and crossing seams of the electronic states of the doublet, quartet, and sextet spin states are calculated along minimum energy paths connecting the energy minima corresponding to the different spin states. The calculated minimum energy crossing points (MECPs) are located at 8.8 kcal/mol in the doublet/sextet surfaces, at 10.2 kcal/mol in the doublet/quartet surfaces, and at 8.4 kcal/mol in the quartet/sextet surfaces relative to the doublet ground state. Considering the energy of the three spin states and the crossing points, the one-step relaxation mechanism between the Co(II-HS) and Co(III-LS) forms is the most probable.

An arginine-rich mitochondrial protein that binds to guide RNA with high affinity.;RNA editing in Trypanosoma brucei is a mitochondrial RNA processing reaction that results in the insertion and deletion of uridylate residues into otherwise untranslatable mRNAs. The process is directed by guide RNAs which function to specify the edited sequence. RNA editing in vitro requires mitochondrial protein extracts and guide RNAs have been identified as part of high molecular weight ribonucleoprotein complexes. Within the complexes, the RNAs are in close contact with several mitochondrial proteins and here we describe the isolation and cloning of a gRNA-interacting polypeptide from Trypanosoma brucei. The protein was named gBP21 for guide RNA-binding protein of 21 kDa. gBP21 shows no homology to proteins in other organisms, it is arginine-rich and binds to gRNA molecules with a dissociation constant in the nanomolar range. The protein does not discriminate for differences in the primary structures of gRNAs and thus likely binds to higher order structural features common to all gRNA molecules. gBP21 binding does not perturb the overall structure of gRNAs but the gRNA/gBP21 ribonucleoprotein complex is more stable than naked guide RNAs. Although the protein is arginine-rich, the free amino acid or an arginine-rich peptide were not able to inhibit the association to the RNAs. In contrast, the gRNA-gBP21 complex formation was sensitive to potassium and ammonium cations, thus indicating a contribution of ionic contacts to the binding. ;polyarginine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Cysteine-rich portions expressed from trx cDNAs in Escherichia coli are capable of zinc binding in vitro, suggesting a possible function for the trx product as a metal-dependent DNA-binding protein. Analysis of trx mutant embryos with antibody to the Ultrabithorax (Ubx) gene product showed decreased staining in parasegment 6 of the ventral nerve cord of late embryos. However, expression of Ubx was not affected in embryos carrying the lethal mutation trxE3, in which one of the putative zinc finger-like domains of the trx protein is deleted. This differential effect of the E3 mutation suggests that trx exhibits other function(s) besides those involved in the regulation of Ubx expression in the ventral nerve cord of the embryo.;polycysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
4082;10225916;Towards a Taenia solium cysticercosis vaccine: an epitope shared by Taenia crassiceps and Taenia solium protects mice against experimental cysticercosis.;The Taenia crassiceps recombinant antigen KETc7 has been shown to be effective as a vaccine against experimental murine cysticercosis, a laboratory model used to test potentially promising molecules against porcine Taenia solium cysticercosis. Based on the deduced amino acid sequence of this proline-rich polypeptide, three fragments, GK-1, GK-2, and GK-3, were chemically synthesized in linear form. Of the three peptides, only GK-1 induced sterile protection against T. crassiceps cysticercosis in 40 to 70% of BALB/cAnN male mice. GK-1 is an 18-amino-acid peptide which contains at least one B-cell epitope, as demonstrated by its ability to induce an antibody response to the peptide and T. crassiceps antigen without need of a carrier protein. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that anti-GK1 antibodies strongly react with the native protein in the tegument of T. crassiceps and also with anatomical structures of T. solium eggs, oncospheres, cysticercus, and tapeworm. GK-1 also contains at least one T-cell epitope, capable of stimulating the proliferation of CD8(+) and to a lower extent CD4(+) T cells primed either with the free peptide or T. crassiceps total antigen. The supernatant of the stimulated cells contained high levels of gamma interferon and low levels of interleukin-4. Similar results were obtained with T cells tested for intracellular cytokine production, an indication of the peptide's capacity to induce an inflammatory response. The remarkable protection induced by GK-1 immunization, its physicochemical properties, and its presence in all developmental stages of T. solium point to this synthetic peptide as a strong candidate in the construction of a synthetic vaccine against T. solium pig cysticercosis. ;polyproline;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
4085;9254678;Evidence that the homeodomain protein Gtx is involved in the regulation of oligodendrocyte myelination.;"We have investigated the patterns of postnatal brain expression and DNA binding of Gtx, a homeodomain transcription factor. Gtx mRNA accumulates in parallel with the RNAs encoding the major structural proteins of myelin, myelin basic protein (MBP), and proteolipid protein (PLP) during postnatal brain development; Gtx mRNA decreases in parallel with MBP and PLP mRNAs in the brains of myelin-deficient rats, which have a point mutation in the PLP gene. Gtx mRNA is expressed in differentiated, postmitotic oligodendrocytes but is not found in oligodendrocyte precursors or astrocytes. These data thus demonstrate that Gtx is expressed uniquely in differentiated oligodendrocytes in postnatal rodent brain and that its expression is regulated in parallel with the major myelin protein mRNAs, encoding MBP and PLP, under a variety of physiologically relevant circumstances. Using a Gtx fusion protein produced in bacteria, we have confirmed that Gtx is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, which binds DNA sequences containing a core AT-rich homeodomain binding site. Immunoprecipitation of labeled DNA fragments encoding either the MBP or PLP promoter regions with this fusion protein has identified several Gtx-binding fragments, and we have confirmed these data using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. In this way we have identified four Gtx binding sites within the first 750 bp of the MBP promoter and four Gtx binding sites within the first 1. 3 kb of the PLP promoter. In addition, inspection of the PLP promoter sequence demonstrates the presence of six additional Gtx binding sites. These data, taken together, strongly suggest that Gtx is important for the function of differentiated oligodendrocytes and may be involved in the regulation of myelin-specific gene expression.

Ultraviolet absorption spectra show that Tat binds two Zn2+ or two Cd2+ ions per monomer, and electrophoresis of the Tat-metal complexes demonstrates that the protein forms metal-linked dimers.

4090;8219280;"The mouse Mel-18 ""RING-finger"" gene: genomic organization, promoter analysis and chromosomal assignment.";"The chromosome gene for mouse Mel-18 (mMel-18) protein has been isolated and characterized. The entire mMel-18 gene is composed of thirteen exons spanning about 15 kilobases, in which the protein is encoded by exons 5-13. The ""RING-finger"" motif of Mel-18 protein that displays a significant evolutionary resemblance to other RING-finger nuclear proteins is encoded by exons 5 and 6. Exon 13 encodes a C-terminal proline/serine-rich domain that is homologous to some transactivator proteins. Sequence analysis of the 5'-flanking region revealed the presence of potential binding sites for transcription factors such as SP-1, NF-1, NF-kappa B and c-myc/max. At least two major cap sites and three minor cap sites were identified by S1 mapping and primer extension analysis. We propose that the mMel-18 gene is regulated by two different types of promoters, the CAAT-TATA box promoter and the GC-rich TATA-less promoter. The 2.4 kb DNA fragment of the 5'-flanking region exhibited constitutive promoter activity when transfected into L cells. By the in situ hybridization method, the mMel-18 gene was assigned to mouse chromosome 10C3. ";polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
4091;28717163;Titin-mediated thick filament activation, through a mechanosensing mechanism, introduces sarcomere-length dependencies in mathematical models of rat trabecula and whole ventricle.;Recent experimental evidence in skeletal muscle demonstrated the existence of a thick-filament mechanosensing mechanism, acting as a second regulatory system for muscle contraction, in addition to calcium-mediated thin filament regulation. These two systems cooperate to generate force, but the extent to which their interaction is relevant in physiologically contracting muscle was not yet assessed experimentally. Therefore, we included both regulatory mechanisms in a mathematical model of rat trabecula and whole ventricle. No additional regulatory mechanisms were considered in our model. Our simulations suggested that mechanosensing regulation is not limited to the initial phases of contraction but, instead, is crucial during physiological contraction. An important consequence of this finding is that titin mediated thick filament activation can account for several sarcomere length dependencies observed in contracting muscle. Under the hypothesis that a similar mechanism is acting on cardiac muscle, and within the limits of a finite element left ventricle model, we predict that these two regulatory mechanisms are crucial for the molecular basis of the Frank-Starling law of the heart.;-;-;-;hard_0
4098;9154810;Regulated expression and RNA processing of transcripts from the Srp20 splicing factor gene during the cell cycle.;Eukaryotic splicing factors belonging to the SR family are essential splicing factors consisting of an N-terminal RNA-binding region and a C-terminal RS domain. They are believed to be involved in alternative splicing of numerous transcripts because their expression levels can influence splice site selection. We have characterized the structure and transcriptional regulation of the gene for the smallest member of the SR family, SRp20 (previously called X16). The mouse gene encoding SRp20, termed Srp20, consists of one alternative exon and six constitutive exons and was mapped to a 2-centimorgan interval on chromosome 17. When cells are transfected with SRp20 genomic DNA, both standard and alternatively spliced transcripts and corresponding proteins are produced. Interestingly, in starved (G0) cells, the amount of SRp20 mRNA containing the alternative exon is large, whereas the amount of the standard SRp20 mRNA without the alternative exon is small. When starved cells are stimulated with serum, the alternative form is lost and the standard form is induced. These results suggest that splicing could be regulated during the cell cycle and that this could be, at least in part, due to regulated expression of SR proteins. Consistent with this, experiments with synchronized cells showed an induction of SRp20 transcripts in late G1 or early S. We have also characterized the promoter of SRp20. It lies within a GC-rich CpG island and contains two consensus binding sites for E2F, a transcription factor thought to be involved in regulating the cell cycle. These motifs may be functional since reporter constructs with the SRp20 promoter can be stimulated by cotransfection with E2F expression plasmids.;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
4100;27063608;Structural and functional evaluation of the palindromic alanine-rich antimicrobial peptide Pa-MAP2.;Recently, several peptides have been studied regarding the defence process against pathogenic microorganisms, which are able to act against different targets, with the purpose of developing novel bioactive compounds. The present work focuses on the structural and functional evaluation of the palindromic antimicrobial peptide Pa-MAP2, designed based on the peptide Pa-MAP from Pleuronectes americanus. For a better structural understanding, molecular modelling analyses were carried out, together with molecular dynamics and circular dichroism, in different media. Antibacterial activity against Gram-negative and positive bacteria was evaluated, as well as cytotoxicity against human erythrocytes, RAW 264.7, Vero and L6 cells. In silico docking experiments, lipid vesicle studies, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging were carried out to explore the activity of the peptide. In vivo studies on infected mice were also done. The palindromic primary sequence favoured an α-helix structure that was pH dependent, only present on alkaline environment, with dynamic N- and C-terminals that are stabilized in anionic media. Pa-MAP2 only showed activity against Gram-negative bacteria, with a MIC of 3.2 μM, and without any cytotoxic effect. In silico, lipid vesicles and AFM studies confirm the preference for anionic lipids (POPG, POPS, DPPE, DPPG and LPS), with the positively charged lysine residues being essential for the initial electrostatic interaction. In vivo studies showed that Pa-MAP2 increases to 100% the survival rate of mice infected with Escherichia coli. Data here reported indicated that palindromic Pa-MAP2 could be an alternative candidate for use in therapeutics against Gram-negative bacterial infections. ;polyalanine;helix;-;LCR_with_function

This kind of drainage was able to empty the abscess satisfactorily but it caused the onset of a gastrocutaneous fistula. This one was sutured on the gastric side by metal clips placed by gastroscopy.

4110;23559898;Induction of Potent Antigen-specific Cytotoxic T Cell Response by PLGA-nanoparticles Containing Antigen and TLR Agonist.;Previously we showed that biodegradable nanoparticles containing poly-IC or CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) together with ovalbumin (OVA) were efficient at inducing MHC-restricted presentation of OVA peptides in dendritic cells. The CTL-inducing activities of the nanoparticles were examined in the present study. Nanoparticles containing poly-IC or CpG ODN together with OVA were prepared using biodegradable polymer poly(D,L-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid), and then were opsonized with mouse IgG. The nanoparticles were injected into the tail vein of mice, and 7 days later the OVA-specific CTL activities were measured using an in vivo CTL assay. Immunization of mice with the nanoparticles containing poly-IC or CpG ODN together with OVA elicited potent OVA-specific CTL activity compared to those containing OVA only. In accordance with these results, nanoparticles containing poly-IC or CpG ODN together with OVA exerted potent antitumor activity in mice that were subcutaneously implanted with EG7.OVA tumor cells. These results show that encapsulation of poly-IC or CpG ODN together with antigen in biodegradable nanoparticles is an effective approach for the induction of potent antigen-specific CTL responses in vivo. ;polyisoleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
4112;8218204;The glutamyl-tRNA synthetase of Escherichia coli contains one atom of zinc essential for its native conformation and its catalytic activity.;The glutamyl-tRNA synthetase of Escherichia coli contains one atom of zinc. This metal ion is strongly bound, as it is not removed by 8 M urea. Slow removal of the zinc at 4 degrees C in the presence of the specific chelating agent, 1,10-phenanthroline, is proportional to the loss of aminoacylation activity and to the presence of a more open conformer of the enzyme. This conformer migrates more slowly than the native enzyme during gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions and binds tRNA(Glu). Infrared spectroscopy measurements show that it differs from the native enzyme by a lower alpha-helix content and a higher proportion of beta-sheet and unordered structures. ATP protects the enzyme against 1,10-phenanthroline-mediated zinc removal, suggesting that the zinc-binding region is closely associated with the catalytic site. Additional support for this conclusion comes from the presence of zinc in the 27-kDa N-terminal half of the enzyme and in a 10-kDa fragment. The latter is homologous to the tRNA acceptor helix binding domain of E. coli glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase. The presence of the conserved CYC motif in this domain of the zinc-containing glutamyl-tRNA synthetases of E. coli and Bacillus subtilis, and its absence in that of Thermus thermophilus and the E. coli glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase which do not contain zinc, suggest that the cysteines of this motif and the C- and H-rich 125CRHSHEHHX5C138 segment present in the 10-kDa zinc-binding fragment are involved in zinc binding by the glutamyl-tRNA synthetase of E. coli. ;polyhistidine;helix;-;LCR_with_function

Postural ataxia was quantitatively studied in 8 patients with spinal ataxia (Friedreich's), 6 patients with vestibulocerebellar lesions, 11 patients with anterior lobe atrophy, 7 patients with hemispheral cerebellar lesions, and 9 patients with a disease affecting all parts of the cerebellum. Patients with lesions of the cerebellar hemispheres could not be separated from normals by means of posturography. Lesions of the spino-cerebellar afferents (Friedreich' ataxia) caused an omnidirectional low frequency sway with preserved visual stabilization. Patients with anterior lobe atrophy showed a predominant antero-posterior sway, often with a spontaneous high frequency body tremor around 3 Hz. Vestibulo-cerebellar lesions exhibited omnidirectional low frequency sway poorly stabilized by vision.

4117;6481438;Periodic simple cells in cat area 17.;Quantitative, high-resolution static receptive-field plots (response planes) in cat area 17 revealed simple cells whose receptive fields were composed of four to six excitatory regions alternating in space with up to seven inhibitory regions. The size, shape, and spacing of the excitatory regions within these receptive fields were highly regular, giving the receptive field a periodic appearance in space. We call these periodic simple cells. A periodic simple cell's response to moving stimuli could, in general, be anticipated from the detailed spatiotemporal map of excitatory and inhibitory regions provided by response planes. This observation suggests that periodic simple cells, like the more common simple cells composed of one to three excitatory regions, sum spatially distributed inputs in a roughly linear manner. Based on a quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution and time course of response of single excitatory regions within periodic receptive fields, as described in the previous paper, we characterized periodic simple cells as either X-like or Y-like. Furthermore, we found that periodic simple cells classified as X-like gave a more sustained response to standing contrast and had significantly smaller excitatory regions than those cells classified as Y-like. Periodic simple cells were found in layer III and at the border between layers III and IVab. It is suggested that these cells, which reside outside the primary zone of geniculate termination and include both X-like and Y-like types, may be constructed hierarchically from the convergence of lower order simple cells. In the spatial-frequency domain, periodic simple receptive fields were predicted to have bandwidths at half-maximum ranging from 0.80 to 1.4 octaves. By comparison, the predicted bandwidths of cells composed of two or three excitatory regions ranged from 1.6 to 4.3 octaves. Thus as additional excitatory regions are added to the receptive fields of simple cells, their bandwidth narrows in the spatial-frequency domain.;-;-;-;hard_0
4120;9568720;NMR structure of the bacteriophage lambda N peptide/boxB RNA complex: recognition of a GNRA fold by an arginine-rich motif.;The structure of the complex formed by the arginine-rich motif of the transcriptional antitermination protein N of phage lambda and boxB RNA was determined by heteronuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A bent alpha helix in N recognizes primarily the shape and negatively charged surface of the boxB hairpin through multiple hydrophobic and ionic interactions. The GAAGA boxB loop forms a GNRA fold, previously described for tetraloops, which is essential for N binding. The fourth nucleotide of the loop extrudes from the GNRA fold to enable the E. coli elongation factor NusA to recognize the N protein/RNA complex. This structure reveals a new mode of RNA-protein recognition and shows how a small RNA element can facilitate a protein-protein interaction and thereby nucleate formation of a large ribonucleoprotein complex. ;polyarginine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
4123;11704675;Paxillin associates with poly(A)-binding protein 1 at the dense endoplasmic reticulum and the leading edge of migrating cells.;"Using mass spectrometry we have identified proteins which co-immunoprecipitate with paxillin, an adaptor protein implicated in the integrin-mediated signaling pathways of cell motility. A major component of paxillin immunoprecipitates was poly(A)-binding protein 1, a 70-kDa mRNA-binding protein. Poly(A)-binding protein 1 associated with both the alpha and beta isoforms of paxillin, and this was unaffected by RNase treatment consistent with a protein-protein interaction. The NH(2)-terminal region of paxillin (residues 54-313) associated directly with poly(A)-binding protein 1 in cell lysates, and with His-poly(A)-binding protein 1 immobilized in microtiter wells. Binding was specific, saturable and of high affinity (K(d) of approximately 10 nm). Cell fractionation studies showed that at steady state, the bulk of paxillin and poly(A)-binding protein 1 was present in the ""dense"" polyribosome-associated endoplasmic reticulum. However, inhibition of nuclear export with leptomycin B caused paxillin and poly(A)-binding protein 1 to accumulate in the nucleus, indicating that they shuttle between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. When cells migrate, poly(A)-binding protein 1 colocalized with paxillin-beta at the tips of lamellipodia. Our results suggest a new mechanism whereby a paxillin x poly(A)-binding protein 1 complex facilitates transport of mRNA from the nucleus to sites of protein synthesis at the endoplasmic reticulum and the leading lamella during cell migration.

The protein possesses putative GTP-binding sites, a zinc finger motif, and a highly charged N-terminal region composed of three basic polylysine blocks separated by acidic domains.

Evaluations were made ex vivo on fresh samples collected from 63 patients with unilateral or bilateral hernias and 30 control subjects without hernias. Under 50 and 200 mbar suctions, there was no statistical difference between the overall mechanical properties of control and patient aponeuroses. For both 50 and 200 mbar suctions, the maximum distension (MD) and the biological elasticity (BE) of fasciae from direct hernias were significantly increased, compared with control fasciae. In the same comparison, the MD-50 and -200 and the BE-50 of patient fasciae from the non-herniated sides were also significantly increased. It is concluded that the presently reported biomechanical alterations seem to be the cause and not the consequence of the hernias.

4131;9160721;Effect of dietary fat on the fatty acid composition and fertilizing ability of fowl semen.;Broiler breeder roosters received two diets, containing either 5% salmon oil (SO) or 5% corn oil (CO). The diets differed essentially in their polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) composition, with n-6:n-3 fatty acid ratios of 41.6 in SO and 1.5 in CO. The effects of these diets on the fatty acid composition of spermatozoa and seminal plasma, and on fertility evaluated after artificial insemination were observed. Whatever the diet, the fatty acid composition of spermatozoa showed notable amounts of 20:4n-6 (5-9%) and 22:4n-6 (15-21%). These essential fatty acids were not detected in the diets and were synthesized from 18:2n-6, which was abundant in the diet (15-16%) but low in spermatozoa (2-3%). Spermatozoa were also very rich in saturated fatty acids (39%). There was a clear influence of dietary lipids on the spermatozoa fatty acid profile: the proportion of n-3 fatty acids in spermatozoa from males fed SO compared to CO was higher (9.6% vs. 4.3%) and that of n-6 fatty acids was lower (22.4% vs. 33.3%). The fatty acid composition of seminal plasma included a higher proportion of saturated fatty acids (49%) than the proportion in spermatozoa, whereas minor fatty acids (14:0, 16:1n-7, 16:1n-9, 22:5n-3) were not detected. The influence of dietary lipids on the seminal plasma fatty acid profile was the same as for the spermatozoa, especially in the PUFA profile. In addition, the SO diet gave significantly higher fertility rates (96%) than the CO diet (91.6%). These results clearly show that the lipid composition of the diet may modify the fatty acid composition of the semen and its fertilizing ability.;-;-;-;hard_0
4134;3350007;Characterization of four tyrosine protein kinases from the particulate fraction of rat spleen.;"Four distinct tyrosine protein kinases active on poly(Glu4,Tyr1) and angiotensin II, and operationally termed TPK-I, TPK-IIA, TPK-IIB and TPK-III have been resolved and partially purified from rat spleen particulate fraction by combining DEAE-Sepharose, heparin-Sepharose, phosphocellulose and polylysine-agarose chromatographies. Once partially purified all of them are free of Ser/Thr-specific protein kinase activity as judged using casein, histones, protamine and the peptide Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Val-Ala as substrates. TPK-I (apparent molecular mass 64 kDa, by gel filtration) and TPK-IIA (54 kDa) share several properties, including substrate specificity and stimulation by heparin; the latter however is much more responsive to polylysine then the former (10- and 3-fold maximum stimulation, respectively). Conversely TPK-IIB (51 kDa) is markedly inhibited by heparin and it is also characterized by its unique substrate specificity: unlike the other three tyrosine protein kinases it by far prefers the tetrapeptide Glu-Tyr-Ala-Ala over the decapeptide Asp-Ala-Glu-Tyr-Ala-Ala-Arg-Arg-Arg-Gly and readily phosphorylates band-3 protein of red cell membrane. The unusual preference for Mg2+ over Mn2+ as activator and the capability to phosphorylate calmodulin distinguish TPK-III (61 kDa) from the other isoenzymes. Moreover TPK-III is insensitive to heparin and polylysine and is inhibited by quercetin much more efficiently than the other enzymes (I50 = 10 microM). Upon incubation with [gamma-32P]ATP, TPK-I, TPK-IIA and TPK-III give rise to alkali-stable radiolabeled components of 61, 55 and 52 kDa respectively, as evaluated by PAGE/SDS. In every case such a radiolabeling takes place also in the presence of a large excess of phosphorylatable substrate (angiotensin II) while it is readily reversed by isotopic dilution with 10-fold excess unlabeled ATP, supporting the view that it represents an autophosphorylation process. No (auto)phosphorylation product(s) could be detected in TPK-IIB even if its amount, in terms of catalytic activity, was 10-fold higher than that of the others.";polylysine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function

Using primers based on the human CENP-B box present in alpha-satellite DNA and part of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae CDEIII centromeric sequence, a number of specific DNA fragments were amplified from total genomic DNA. In situ hybridization to polytene and mitotic chromosomes showed these fragments to localise to centromeric and pericentromeric regions. Direct cloning of the amplified fragments into conventional plasmids proved unsuccessful. However, a recombinant P1 clone containing D. melanogaster genomic DNA that supports PCR amplification by the primers was identified. Molecular characterisation of this clone revealed a DNA fragment that localises primarily to the centromere of chromosome 2. Sequence analysis indicated that this fragment contains at least four different repeats, including Rsp, transposable elements, Bari-1 and a new AT-rich repeated sequence that we have designated Porto-1. Detailed fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis shows that Porto-1 is localised very close to the primary constriction of chromosome 2. Sequence analysis suggests that this repeat was specifically amplified by our primers, although limited homology to the CENP-B box or CDEIII elements was found. In situ hybridization to a number of Drosophila species shows Porto-1 to be present only in D. melanogaster. ;polythreonine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

In their broad-spectrum activity, dhvar1 and dhvar2 were comparable to magainins (PGLa and magainin 2), antimicrobial peptides of amphibian origin.

4145;33854522;Identification and Regulation of Tomato Serine/Arginine-Rich Proteins Under High Temperatures.;Alternative splicing is an important mechanism for the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes during development, cell differentiation or stress response. Alterations in the splicing profiles of genes under high temperatures that cause heat stress (HS) can impact the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and thermotolerance. Consequently, information on factors involved in HS-sensitive alternative splicing is required to formulate the principles of HS response. Serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins have a central role in alternative splicing. We aimed for the identification and characterization of SR-coding genes in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), a plant extensively used in HS studies. We identified 17 canonical SR and two SR-like genes. Several SR-coding genes show differential expression and altered splicing profiles in different organs as well as in response to HS. The transcriptional induction of five SR and one SR-like genes is partially dependent on the master regulator of HS response, HS transcription factor HsfA1a. Cis-elements in the promoters of these SR genes were predicted, which can be putatively recognized by HS-induced transcription factors. Further, transiently expressed SRs show reduced or steady-state protein levels in response to HS. Thus, the levels of SRs under HS are regulated by changes in transcription, alternative splicing and protein stability. We propose that the accumulation or reduction of SRs under HS can impact temperature-sensitive alternative splicing.;polyarginine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

QTMS reveals the active region of the substituted phenols and identifies the electronic descriptors that best explain the range of DeltaBDEs observed. For substituents in the 4-X position (para) we find that our model requires a correction for radical stabilization enthalpy (RSE). Application of the QTMS methodology yields an unrivalled QSAR with r(2) = 0.98 and q(2) = 0.85 for the bond dissociation enthalpies of this phenolic antioxidant data set.;-;-;-;hard_0
4149;8056546;Eleven year review of infective endocarditis.;"Twenty children were treated for infective endocarditis (IE) at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children during an eleven year period from January 1980 to December 1990. One child had I.E. on two occasions due to different microorganisms. Two had Down syndrome. Congenital heart disease (CHD) was the single most common underlying condition and there was none with rheumatic heart disease. Two had no clinically recognised cardiac anomaly. 13/20 (65%) had acyanotic heart disease and 5/20 (25%) had cyanotic CHD. Among the acyanotic group, ventricular septal defect was most common (6/13); followed by aortic lesions (4/13). There was one case each of coarctation of aorta, patent ductus arteriosus and interrupted aortic arch. Transposition of the great arteries was most common among the cyanotic group (3/5). Four children in the cyanotic group had systemic to pulmonary artery shunts; Blalock Taussig (2), Waterston (1), and aortopulmonary (1). Infection was caused by Streptococcus viridans in 10/20 (50%) and Staphylococcus aureus in 7/20 (35%). Kingella Kingae, Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus faecalis were the pathogens in the remainder (15%). Vegetations were detected by echocardiography in 12/19 (63%). The mean duration of antibiotic treatment was 5 weeks (1 day-18 weeks). Surgical intervention was necessary in 4 children (20%). Fifteen children (75%) survived and the mean follow up period was 22.6 months (15 days-6 1/2 years). The overall mortality was 25%.";-;-;-;hard_0
4152;21391967;Inattentive behaviour is associated with poor working memory and slow processing speed in very pre-term children in middle childhood.;BACKGROUND. Problem behaviour is common following pre-term birth, but the underlying nature of these difficulties is not well known. AIMS. We sought to establish the mechanisms underpinning behavioural difficulties in very pre-term (VPT) children in middle childhood by comparing their performance to that of term born peers on tasks of working memory, inhibition, and processing speed, and relating these to parent and teacher assessments of their behaviour. Particular focus was given to inattention and overactive/impulsive behaviour, as these behaviours have been associated with different neuropsychological problems in term children. SAMPLES. A group of VPT children (gestational age < 31 weeks, N= 56) aged 9-10 years and term controls (N= 22) participated in the study. METHOD. Children were assessed with measures of working memory, inhibition, and processing speed. Parents and teachers reported behavioural problems using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and two additional scales measuring overactive/impulsive behaviour and inattention. RESULTS. Results revealed increased rates of problem behaviour in VPT compared to term children for parent-rated total difficulties, hyperactivity, emotional problems, peer problems, prosocial behaviour, overactive/impulsive behaviour, and parent- and teacher-rated inattention. Processing speed and working memory, but not inhibition, were significantly related to inattentive and overactive/impulsive behaviour. CONCLUSIONS. The increased rates of inattention and overactive/impulsive behaviour in VPT children may be explained by impairment in processing speed and working memory. Expected links between overactive/impulsive behaviour and inhibitory control were not identified, suggesting the nature of such difficulties may be different in VPT compared to term children.;-;-;-;hard_0

The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of a personality construct, ""hypermasculinity,"" and anger on sexual aggression. One hundred and thirty-seven males completed hypermasculinity, anger, and past sexual aggression measures. The subjects who scored in the upper and lower thirds on the hypermasculinity measure were then randomly assigned to guided imagery conditions in which they received negative, neutral, or positive feedback from a woman. Analysis indicated that hypermasculine men who receive negative feedback responded with more anger and less empathy than nonhypermasculine men. In addition, those who scored high on both anger and hypermasculinity measures were most likely to self-report that they had engaged in sexually aggressive acts. The results are discussed in terms of hypermasculine men's increased risk of sexually aggressive behavior.";-;-;-;hard_0
4157;30121513;Overexpression of alfalfa Orange gene in tobacco enhances carotenoid accumulation and tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses.;"The multifunctional Orange (Or) protein plays crucial roles in carotenoid homeostasis, photosynthesis stabilization, and antioxidant activity in plants under various abiotic stress conditions. The Or gene has been cloned in several crops but not in alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). Alfalfa is widely cultivated across the world; however, its cultivation is largely limited by various abiotic stresses, including drought. In this study, we isolated the Or gene from alfalfa (MsOr) cv. Xinjiang Daye. The amino acid sequence of the deduced MsOr protein revealed that the protein contained two trans-membrane domains and a DnaJ cysteine-rich zinc finger domain, and showed a high level of similarity with the Or protein of other plants species. The MsOr protein was localized in leaf chloroplasts of tobacco. The expression of MsOr was the highest in mature leaves and was significantly induced by abiotic stresses, especially drought. To perform functional analysis of the MsOr gene, we overexpressed MsOr gene in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana). Compared with wild-type (WT) plants, transgenic tobacco lines showed higher carotenoid accumulation and increased tolerance to various abiotic stresses, including drought, heat, salt, and methyl viologen-mediated oxidative stress. Additionally, contents of hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde were lower in the transgenic lines than in WT plants, suggesting superior membrane stability and antioxidant capacity of TOR lines under multiple abiotic stresses. These results indicate the MsOr gene as a potential target for the development of alfalfa cultivars with enhanced carotenoid content and tolerance to multiple environmental stresses.

4158;8070522;Differentiation and maturation of astrocytes derived from neuroepithelial progenitor cells in culture.;Neuroepithelial progenitor cells from striata of adult mice develop into either astrocytes or neurons when cultured in the presence of epidermal growth factor (B. A. Reynolds, and S. Weiss, Science 255: 1707-1710, 1992). We instituted primary cultures of such progenitor cells from forebrains of newborn rat pups in an epidermal growth factor-containing medium free of serum in order to study the development of astrocytes in culture. At 4-6 days, primary cultures consisted of floating clusters of proliferating cells which expressed nestin, a marker for neuroepithelial progenitor cells, the ganglioside GD3, and vimentin. When clusters were transferred to polylysine-coated dishes, cells attached to the substrate and began to express antigens characteristic of particular differentiated neurons, astrocytes, or oligodendrocytes within 2 weeks. In 4- to 6-week-old secondary cultures, levels of vimentin expression appeared to decrease within maturing astrocytes which had increased levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein. These results suggest that multipotential epidermal growth factor-progenitor cells can give rise to both neurons and macroglia of the adult central nervous system, and that maturation of the astrocytes in vitro may be occurring in a pattern similar to that seen in vivo. Furthermore, no glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells expressed the A2B5 antigen in the same cell indicating an absence of type-2 astrocytes.;polylysine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
4161;34641573;The Reactive Sites of Methane Activation: A Comparison of IrC3+ with PtC3.;The activation reactions of methane mediated by metal carbide ions MC3+ (M = Ir and Pt) were comparatively studied at room temperature using the techniques of mass spectrometry in conjunction with theoretical calculations. MC3+ (M = Ir and Pt) ions reacted with CH4 at room temperature forming MC2H2+/C2H2 and MC4H2+/H2 as the major products for both systems. Besides that, PtC3+ could abstract a hydrogen atom from CH4 to generate PtC3H+/CH3, while IrC3+ could not. Quantum chemical calculations showed that the MC3+ (M = Ir and Pt) ions have a linear M-C-C-C structure. The first C-H activation took place on the Ir atom for IrC3+. The terminal carbon atom was the reactive site for the first C-H bond activation of PtC3+, which was beneficial to generate PtC3H+/CH3. The orbitals of the different metal influence the selection of the reactive sites for methane activation, which results in the different reaction channels. This study investigates the molecular-level mechanisms of the reactive sites of methane activation.;-;-;-;hard_0
4162;9484779;Regulation of the specific DNA binding activity of Xenopus laevis p53: evidence for conserved regulation through the carboxy-terminus of the protein.;Recombinant human p53 isolated either from E. coli or from insect cells is poorly active for binding to DNA but it can be dramatically stimulated by phosphorylation, antibody binding to the carboxy-terminal negative regulatory domain, short peptides derived from this negative regulatory domain or short single strands of DNA. We report here that Xenopus p53 has a very similar behavior. Using a new set of monoclonal antibodies directed either to the amino- or the carboxy-terminus of Xenopus p53, we demonstrate that the frog protein can be activated by specific carboxy-terminus monoclonal antibodies in order to bind to human p53 DNA response element. In addition, we report that such activation of both humans and frogs protein can also be achieved by small peptides derived from the carboxy-terminus of both p53. Although, the sequence of this region is not conserved in the various p53 species, the presence of conserved basic residues indicates that such activation is charge-dependent. This is confirmed by the finding that small poly-lysine peptides can activate both human and Xenopus p53. In vivo expression of Xenopus p53 indicates that this protein is able to transactivate a wide variety of human p53 response elements as long as the experiments are performed at 32 degrees C since activity at 37 degrees C, a temperature well above the natural temperature of Xenopus, is lost. Finally, we demonstrate that human mdm2 is able to down regulate the transcriptional activity of Xenopus p53. ;polylysine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
4163;11580248;Intrinsic bending and deformability at the T-A step of CCTTTAAAGG: a comparative analysis of T-A and A-T steps within A-tracts.;Introduction of a T-A or pyrimidine-purine step into a straight and rigid A-tract can cause a positive roll deformation that kinks the DNA helix at that step. In CCTTTAAAGG, the central T-A step has an 8.6 degrees bend toward the major groove. We report the structural analysis of CCTTTAAAGG and a comparison with 25 other representative crystal structures from the NDB containing at least four consecutive A or T bases. On average, more local bending occurs at the disruptive T-A step (8.21 degrees ) than at an A-T step (5.71 degrees ). In addition, A-tracts containing an A-T step are more bent than are pure A-tracts, and hence A-A and A-T steps are not equivalent. All T-A steps examined exhibit positive roll, bending towards the major groove, while A-T steps display negative roll and bend slightly towards the minor groove. This illustrates how inherent negative and positive roll are, respectively, at A-T and T-A steps within A-tracts. T-A steps are more deformable, showing larger and more variable deformations of minor groove width, rise, cup, twist, and buckle. Standard deviations of twist, rise, and cup for T-A steps are 6.66 degrees, 0.55 A, and 15.90 degrees, versus 2.28 degrees, 0.21 A, and 2.99 degrees for A-T steps. Packing constraints determine which local values of these helical parameters an individual T-A step will adopt. For instance, with CCTTTAAAGG and three isomorphous structures, CGATTAATCG, CGATATATCG, and CGATCGATCG, crystal packing forces lead to a series of correlated changes: widened minor groove, large slide, low twist, and large rise. The difference in helical parameters between A-T steps lying within A-tracts, versus A-T steps within alternating AT sequences, demonstrates the importance of neighboring steps on the conformation of a given dinucleotide step. ;polyalanine;helix;-;LCR_with_function

The lucidity of the molecular mechanism of FXTAS is emerging and findings from research in the field of FXTAS could elucidate the pathogenesis of FXPOI. To date there are three possible mechanisms for ovarian dysfunction in FMR1 permutation carriers. The first is the RNA toxic gain-of-function mechanism initiating loss of function of over 30 specific RNA-binding proteins. The second is associated to the formation of an abnormal polyglycine-containing protein (FMRpolyG), and the third is related to novel lncRNAs, named FMR4 and FMR6. Herein we describe our laboratory methodology, focusing on the culturing and manipulation of granulosa cells from human female premutation carriers, trying to reveal the actual possible mechanisms liable to FXPOI. Detecting the precise pathways in premutation carrier might facilitate in offering these women the opportunity to make an informed decision regarding their reproductive and family planning. ;polyglycine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
4169;9362827;Mental illness and criminal behaviour: a literature review.;The purpose of this paper is to review the current literature in relation to mental illness and criminal behaviour. The material presented for discussion was selected from forensic and general psychiatric literature. However, a number of important publications, policy documents and independent reports were used to explore the debate surrounding this subject. Contemporary studies of prison populations in the UK and abroad illustrated the difficulty in relating mental illness to crime. Papers presenting research in the UK revealed important implications for mental health policy and the way in which the penal system deals with mentally disordered offenders. The literature reviewed provided arguments for and against an association between mental illness and criminal behaviour. Methodological problems associated with criminological and psychiatric research were addressed in relation to the exploration of whether people suffering from a mental illness are more dangerous or violent than other people. Research papers focusing on public reaction to mentally ill people living in the community provided important considerations when addressing mental illness and criminal behaviour in the context of care in the community policy. This paper will be of interest to a broad range of mental health professionals, particularly those working with individuals who have a history of mental illness and violent behaviour, or mental health professionals working with mentally disordered offenders.;-;-;-;hard_0
4173;30618688;Language Network Function in Young Children Born Very Preterm.;"Language deficits are reported in preterm born children across development. Recent neuroimaging studies have found functional alterations in large-scale brain networks underlying these language deficits, but the early childhood development of the language network has not been investigated. Here, we compared intrinsic language network connectivity in 4-year-old children born VPT and term-born controls, using defined language regions (Broca's area, Wernicke's areas, and their homologues in the right hemisphere). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was obtained, and the group differences in whole-brain connectivity were examined from each seed as well as correlations with language outcomes. We found significantly decreased functional connectivity in almost all language regions in children born VPT compared to their term controls. Notably, Broca's area homologue in the right hemisphere emerged as a functional hub of decreased connectivity in VPT group, specifically to bilateral inferior frontal and supramarginal gyri; connectivity strength between Broca's area homologue with the right supramarginal and the left inferior frontal gyri was associated with better language outcomes at 4 years of age. Wernicke's area and its homologue also showed decreased inter-hemispheric connections to bilateral supramarginal gyri in the VPT group. Decreased intra- and inter-hemispheric connectivity among primary language regions suggests immature and altered function in the language network in children born VPT.";-;-;-;hard_0
4179;12716893;Chromium(VI) down-regulates heavy metal-induced metallothionein gene transcription by modifying transactivation potential of the key transcription factor, metal-responsive transcription factor 1.;The robust induction of metallothionein-I and II (MT-I and MT-II) genes by several heavy metals such as zinc and cadmium requires the specific transcription factor metal-responsive transcription factor 1 (MTF1). Chromium (VI), a major environmental carcinogen, not only failed to activate these genes but also inhibited their induction by Zn2+ or Cd2+. The heavy metal-induced expression of another MTF1 target gene, zinc transporter 1 (ZnT-1), was also down-regulated by Cr6+. By contrast, the expression of two MTF1-independent Cd2+-inducible genes, heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and HSP-70, was not sensitive to Cr6+. Cr6+ did not also affect the expression of housekeeping genes such as GAPDH or beta-actin. Stable cell lines overexpressing variable levels of MTF1, the key transactivator of the MT genes, demonstrated differential resistance toward the inhibitory effect of Cr6+, indicating MTF1 as a target of chromium toxicity. The basal and inducible binding of MTF1 to metal response elements was not affected by treatment of cells with Cr6+. Transient transfection studies showed that the ability of MTF1 to transactivate the MT-I promoter was significantly compromised by Cr6+. The fusion protein consisting of a Gal-4 DNA binding domain and one or more of the three transactivation domains of MTF1, namely the acidic domain, proline-rich domain, and serine-threonine rich domain, activated the GAL-4-driven luciferase gene to different degrees, but all were sensitive to Cr6+. MTF1 null cells were prone to apoptosis after exposure to Zn2+ or Cd2+ that was augmented in presence Cr6+, whereas the onset of apoptosis was significantly delayed in cells overexpressing MTF1. ;polyproline;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

The receptor-binding domain of PvDBP lies in a conserved N-terminal, cysteine-rich region, region II (PvRII). PvRII is a valuable malaria subunit vaccine candidate for asexual blood stages. We have evaluated in Aotus monkeys the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of recombinant PvRII formulated in Freund's and Montanide ISA720 adjuvants. Specific antibody titers were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay after each of three doses of 50 microg of protein administered by the subcutaneous route. Immunization with PvRII formulated in Freund's adjuvant yielded higher antibody titers than immunization with the Montanide ISA720 formulation and offered partial protection. Although the Montanide ISA720 formulation was immunogenic, it did not provide any protection. Given the immunogenicity and partial protection observed, further studies are needed to optimize the PvRII vaccine formulation with adjuvants suitable for human use. ;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

After screening a cDNA library derived from normal rat fibroblast (3Y1) cells, we obtained several independent cDNAs whose mRNA level was substantially lower in 3Y1 cells transformed with Rous sarcoma virus than in untransformed 3Y1 cells. Among them, N03 cDNA has been characterized extensively. N03 mRNA was also absent from v-mos- or simian virus 40-transformed 3Y1 cells but was present in v-Ha-ras-transformed 3Y1 cells. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed that the N03 protein is composed of 178 amino acid residues and does not have any sequence similarities with proteins in the data base. A putative zinc-finger domain is located in the central part of the sequence and a proline-rich domain is in the C-terminal region. N03 mRNA was detected by Northern blot analysis in several tissues, including lung, kidney, intestine, and brain, but not in liver.

4186;7907121;A comprehensive PC-based computer model for microdosimetry of BNCT.;A computer model is described that performs microdosimetric calculations of the radiation dose delivered to tumour and normal tissue in boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) by simulating capture reactions in a predefined three-dimensional space. The role of intracellular boron distributions and cellular dimensions on the radiation dose in clinical and experimental BNCT has been studied using a PC-based computer model. In order to calculate the radiation dose to low boron uptake cells, the extent of irradiation by boron containing adjacent cells (cross fire) is also dealt with. Radiation doses from boron and nitrogen neutron capture are converted to a biological effect by means of relative individual ion track segment efficacies, based on linear energy transfer along the particle track.

4187;11867614;DNA binding and gene activation properties of the Nmp4 nuclear matrix transcription factors.;Splice variants of the Nmp4 gene include nuclear matrix transcription factors that regulate the type I collagen alpha1(I) polypeptide chain (COL1A1) promoter and several matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) genes. To date, these are the only Cys(2)His(2) zinc finger proteins known to bind within the minor groove of homopolymeric (dA.dT) DNA. Nmp4 isoforms contain from 5 to 8 Cys(2)His(2) zinc fingers, an SH3-binding domain that overlaps with a putative AT-hook and a polyglutamine-alanine repeat (poly(QA)). To determine the mechanistic significance of Cys(2)His(2) zinc finger association with this unusual consensus DNA binding element, we identified the Nmp4 DNA-binding and transcriptional activation domains. Zinc fingers 2, 3, and 6 mediated association with the homopolymeric (dA.dT) COL1A1/MMP DNA consensus element. The N terminus of the Nmp4 protein exhibited a strong trans-activation capacity when fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, but this activity was masked within the context of the full-length Nmp4-GAL4 DNA-binding domain chimera. However, upon binding to the COL1A1/MMP homopolymeric (dA.dT) element, the native Nmp4 protein up-regulated transcription, and the poly(QA) domain acquired a significant role in trans-activation. We propose that allosteric effects induced upon zinc finger association with the homopolymeric (dA.dT) minor groove confer context-specific functionality to this unusual family of Cys(2)His(2) transcription factors. ;polyglutamine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
4190;6365136;Implications of repair models for LET effects and other radiobiological phenomena.;"Repair models account for shoulders to survival curves by the postulate of a mode of repair which is depleted (""saturated"") as dose increases, and which should therefore be distinguished, conceptually and linguistically, from what is commonly known as ""repair of potentially lethal damage"". Acceptance of repair models entails new interpretations of some radiobiological phenomena. ""Recovery"" of cells between dose fractions would be attributable to reconstitution or resynthesis of the putative agent of repair, so elucidation of the mechanism of such ""recovery"" requires a different approach from any that have been used in attempts to discover the nature of ""sub-lethal lesions"" or the mechanism of their repair--attempts that have not been attended by success. Even mammalian cells can yield exponential survival curves; but this fact has been ignored in some proposals for mechanisms of radiation-induced cell killing, and in ""theories of RBE"" based on multi-sublethal lesion models for shouldered survival curves. According to repair models, however, cells in general are basically single-hit detectors. Comparisons between the responses of repair-proficient cells and their deficient mutants to change in radiation quality support the hypothesis that increases in RBE are attributable to reduced capacity for some mode(s) of repair as LET increases; but there is evidence that some capacity remains, even at very high values of LET.";-;-;-;hard_0
4199;8084627;Tracheoplasty using titanium reconstructive plates with strap-muscle flap.;The reasons for unsuccessful decannulation after a laryngotracheoplasty may be multifactorial depending on the techniques used. Excessive granulation tissue may develop, necessitating further adjunctive procedures. Cartilaginous grafts may get infected, resorb, or collapse into the tracheal lumen. Bulky regional skin-muscle flaps may dehisce under tension or collapse into the tracheal lumen. Medial migration of the split ends of the anterior cartilaginous tracheal rings ensues with subsequent restenosis. Donor-site morbidity may compound these problems as well. During a 2.5-year period, we have performed laryngotracheoplasty on nine patients with 60% to 100% tracheal stenosis using titanium reconstruction plates. The split anterior tracheal wall is fixed by the plates in its expanded position. A neurovascularized strap-muscle flap is used to reconstruct the anterior tracheal wall. The flap becomes epithelialized with squamous epithelium within 3 weeks. Successful decannulation was possible in seven of the nine (78%) patients with no further respiratory problems. Of these, six required no further procedures. This technique offers a viable simple alternative to other methods of laryngotracheoplasty without the need for donor cartilage grafts or thick bulky skin-muscle flaps.;-;-;-;hard_0
4201;1453450;A factor with Sp1 DNA-binding specificity stimulates Xenopus U6 snRNA in vivo transcription by RNA polymerase III.;We have previously shown that transcription of the Xenopus U6 snRNA gene by RNA polymerase III is stimulated in injected Xenopus oocytes by an activator element termed the DSE, which contains an octamer sequence. Data presented here reveal that the DSE contains, in addition, a GC-rich sequence capable of binding Sp1. Both elements are required to obtain wild-type levels of U6 transcription in vivo. The Xenopus U6 DSE exhibits optimal activation properties only when positioned at its normal location upstream from the start site. The U6 Sp1 motif binds the mammalian Sp1 transcriptional activator independently of the Oct-1 protein in vitro. Those mutations that lead to a reduced transcription level in vivo abolish the binding of Sp1 in vitro. Thus, transcriptional stimulation through the Xenopus U6 Sp1 motif is likely to be mediated by a protein with DNA-binding specificity identical to mammalian Sp1. These findings support the notion that RNA polymerase II and III transcription complexes share transactivators.;polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
4203;7778269;Identification of a novel human zinc finger protein that specifically interacts with the activation domain of lentiviral Tat proteins.;Transcriptional activation of HIV-1 gene expression by the viral Tat protein requires the interaction of a cellular cofactor with the Tat activation domain. This domain has been shown to consist of the cysteine-rich and core motifs of HIV-1 Tat and is functionally conserved in the distantly related Tat proteins of HIV-2 and EIAV. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel human gene product, termed HT2A, that specifically and precisely binds to the activation domain of HIV-1 Tat and that can also interact with the HIV-2 and EIAV Tat proteins in vivo. We present data further demonstrating that the interaction between the activation domain of HIV-1 Tat and the HT2A protein can be readily detected in the mammalian cell nucleus. Sequence analysis demonstrates that HT2A is a novel member of the C3HC4 or ring finger family of zinc finger proteins that includes several known oncogenes and transcription factors. Overall, these data suggest that HT2A may play a significant role in mediating the biological activity of the HIV-1 Tat protein in vivo. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

Definition of a new technique and results of stimulation by phytohemagglutinin and specific antigens.;The media and culture conditions required for in vitro stimulation of mouse lymphoid cells are described. The medium was arginine-rich and contained heat-inactivated human serum. A component of the human sera necessary for stimulation of the cells was a natural mouse cell agglutinin, which affected both background stimulation and the degree of induced stimulation with phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Absorption of the agglutinin from the human serum rendered the medium incapable of sustaining DNA synthesis in the presence of PHA. The response to PHA of mouse spleen and thymus cells was age-dependent and, although this response was not present at birth, it rapidly rose to adult levels. Spleen cells from mice immunized with bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) or sheep erythrocytes (SRBC) showed increased in vitro reactivity to added purified protein derivative (PPD) or SRBC stroma, dependent on the time of immunization. The dose response curve for the SRBC stroma stimulated, immune spleen cells is compatible with a theory of cell to cell interaction being necessary for an in vitro reaction to antigen.

This study examines the relationship between the coracoclavicular distance measured and the method of distraction. 30 normal subjects participated in the study which used ultrasound (5 MHz linear array) to measure the coracoclavicular distance under four conditions (levels of traction): non-stressed, muscles relaxed; non-stressed, muscles tensed; stressed with 7.5 kg weight hand held; stressed with 7.5 kg weight suspended from the wrist. The data were subjected to a multifactor ANOVA. The level of traction was statistically significant (p < 0.001). The data were then subjected to a Bonferroni multiple comparisons procedure. This showed a difference between the non-stressed and stressed conditions, but there was no difference between the two methods of applying stress to the joint. It was concluded that, in normal subjects, the method of performing the weight bearing examination does not have a significant effect on the magnitude of the coracoclavicular distance.";-;-;-;hard_0

Here we report the isolation of hnRNP complexes from an invertebrate organism, the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster. Candidate hnRNP proteins were purified from D. melanogaster embryos by ssDNA affinity chromatography, and mAbs were produced to many of the major proteins. Genuine hnRNP proteins were identified by several criteria, including nucleoplasmic localization, association with nascent transcripts, crosslinking to poly(A)-containing RNA in living cells, and amino acid sequence. In addition, mAbs that cross-react between the fruitfly and human hnRNP proteins were obtained. Most importantly, using hnRNP-specific mAbs we have purified the hnRNP complexes from D. melanogaster cells. These RNAase-sensitive complexes contain at least 10 major proteins designated hrps, the most abundant proteins having apparent molecular masses of 36, 38, 39, 40, 44, 48, 54, 62, 70, and 75 kD. cDNAs and complete sequences for several of these proteins have been obtained and are presented in the accompanying paper (Matunis, E.

4215;12815291;Flow cytometric monitoring of drug resistance in human tumor cells.;Recent studies have identified a family of glycoproteins which modulate cellular transport of antibiotics, alkaloids and drugs used in cancer chemotherapy. By facilitating efflux of drugs from the intracellular domain, these proteins reduce cytotoxicity and thus confer drug resistance. With the availability of antibodies raised against these phenotypic markers of drug resistance, immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry has been used to study their distribution and expression in normal and tumor cells. As some of the drugs used in cancer chemotherapy and other dyes which are substrates for this efflux pump are fluorescent, laser flow cytometry can be used for rapid quantitation of cellular retention, efflux and heterogeneity in drug transport of a tumor cell population. This method can also be used to screen drugs which may block efflux of a chemotherapeutic drug and thus increase chemosensitivity of a drug resistant tumor. In the present report flow cytometric methods for the study of drug transport and its modulation in tumor cells are discussed.;-;-;-;hard_0
4219;9725847;Overexpression Beadex mutations and loss-of-function heldup-a mutations in Drosophila affect the 3' regulatory and coding components, respectively, of the Dlmo gene.;LIM domains function as bridging modules between different members of multiprotein complexes. We report the cloning of a LIM-containing gene from Drosophila, termed Dlmo, which is highly homologous to the vertebrate LIM-only (LMO) genes. The 3' untranslated (UTR) of Dlmo contains multiple motifs implicated in negative post-transcriptional regulation, including AT-rich elements and Brd-like boxes. Dlmo resides in polytene band 17C1-2, where Beadex (Bx) and heldup-a (hdp-a) mutations map. We demonstrate that Bx mutations disrupt the 3'UTR of Dlmo, and thereby abrogate the putative negative control elements. This results in overexpression of Dlmo, which causes the wing scalloping that is typical of Bx mutants. We show that the erect wing phenotype of hdp-a results from disruption of the coding region of Dlmo. This provides molecular grounds for the suppression of the Bx phenotype by hdp-a mutations. Finally, we demonstrate phenotypic interaction between the LMO gene Dlmo, the LIM homeodomain gene apterous, and the Chip gene, which encodes a homolog of the vertebrate LIM-interacting protein NLI/Ldb1. We propose that in analogy to their vertebrate counterparts, these proteins form a DNA-binding complex that regulates wing development.;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
4225;2009863;A single-stranded DNA binding protein from S. cerevisiae specifically recognizes the T-rich strand of the core sequence of ARS elements and discriminates against mutant sequences.;A protein named ssARS-T binding protein has been purified from yeast that specifically binds to the T-rich strand of the consensus core sequence of yeast autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) elements. As assayed from gel mobility shift experiments the ssARS-T protein shows characteristics of a sequence specific single-stranded DNA binding protein. The complementary A-rich strand of the ARS core sequence is bound much more weakly and no binding can be detected for the double-stranded form of the core sequence. Three single base substitutions in the core sequence that are known to abolish ARS function in vivo also lead to weaker binding of the core sequence to the ssARS-T protein in vitro. The strong correlation between the binding of mutated sequences in vitro and the ARS properties of these sequences in vivo points to an essential function of the ssARS-T protein during replication initiation in yeast ARS elements.;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
4226;8187759;Complex asparagine-linked oligosaccharides are required for morphogenic events during post-implantation development.;Complex asparagine (N)-linked oligosaccharides appear late in phylogeny and are highly regulated in vertebrates. Variations in these structures are found on the majority of cell-surface and secreted proteins. Complex N-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis is initiated in the Golgi apparatus by the action of Mgat-1-encoded UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:alpha-3-D- mannoside beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GlcNAc-TI). To determine if these structures govern ontogenic processes in mammals, mouse embryos were generated that lacked a functional Mgat-1 gene. Inactivation of both Mgat-1 alleles produced deficiencies in GlcNAc-TI activity and complex N-linked oligosaccharides. Embryonic lethality occurred by day 10.5, thus establishing that complex N-linked oligosaccharides are required during post-implantation development. Remarkably, embryonic development proceeded into day 9 with the differentiation of multiple cell types. Complex N-linked oligosaccharides are important for morphogenic processes as neural tube formation, vascularization and the determination of left-right body plan asymmetry were impaired in the absence of a functional Mgat-1 gene.;-;-;-;hard_0
4229;8532535;DNA binding properties of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae DAT1 gene product.;The DAT1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a DNA binding protein (Dat1p) that specifically recognizes the minor groove of non-alternating oligo(A).oligo(T) tracts. Sequence-specific recognition requires arginine residues found within three perfectly repeated pentads (G-R-K-P-G) of the Dat1p DNA binding domain [Reardon, B. J., Winters, R. S., Gordon, D., and Winter, E. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90, 11327-1131]. This report describes a rapid and simple method for purifying the Dat1p DNA binding domain and the biochemical characterization of its interaction with oligo(A).oligo(T) tracts. Oligonucleotide binding experiments and the characterization of yeast genomic Dat1p binding sites show that Dat1p specifically binds to any 11 base sequence in which 10 bases conform to an oligo(A).oligo(T) tract. Binding studies of different sized Dat1p derivatives show that the Dat1p DNA binding domain can function as a monomer. Competition DNA binding assays using poly(I).poly(C), demonstrate that the minor groove oligo(A).oligo(T) constituents are not sufficient for high specificity DNA binding. These data constrain the possible models for Dat1p/oligo(A).oligo(T) complexes, suggest that the DNA binding domain is in an extended structure when complexed to its cognate DNA, and show that Dat1p binding sites are more prevalent than previously thought. ;polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
4234;8170318;Studies of fluid transport in porous rocks by echo-planar MRI.;Attempts to quantify the permeability constant that appears in Darcy's equation in terms of the porosity, tortuosity and surface area have been made by Kozeny and Carman. These results in turn have been translated by Seevers into expressions involving spin-lattice relaxation times. When this work was done originally in the mid-1960s, NMR imaging and spatially localised T1 maps had not been invented. Therefore, bulk T1 average values were used and it is not surprising to see substantial deviations from predicted permeabilities in bore core material. In this paper we re-examine the Kozeny-Carman and Seevers theories in the light of new techniques development for the localised measurement of both T1 maps and fluid velocity maps. New results show spatially correlated T1 and flow maps obtained from Bentheimer sandstone samples. These are discussed in terms of a localised permeability constant. By this means we show that the relationship between T1 and permeability does not hold at the local level for isolated pixels within a larger specimen.;-;-;-;hard_0

Two overlapping clones were selected and a partial nucleotide sequence was deduced (1172 bp). The full-length sequence was obtained by the amplification of the 5' end of first strand cDNA using PCR. The overall mRNA size was 1335 nt including a 25 nt 5' non-coding region and a 131 nt untranslated region with the poly(A) tail. The predicted amino acid sequence of 393 aa (45 kDa) has 52% identity with the human Ro/SS-A autoantigen, which is considered to be the human calreticulin. As for the human Ro/SS-A, the protein encoded by the cDNA described here contains a hydrophobic leader sequence and a carboxyl terminal sequence, HDEL consensus signal sequence for retention in the ER. An antiserum raised against the fusion protein of one clone recognized a 58-kDa antigen in homogenates of cercariae and of adult worms. The expression of the protein in the pGEX-2T fusion system allowed us to show the presence of specific antibodies in S. mansoni infected patients' sera and in the sera of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, reflecting a cross-immunoreactivity between the S. mansoni protein and the human calreticulin autoantigen.; polyalanine ;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

4239;26497528;Immune regulation by Fcα/μ receptor (CD351) on marginal zone B cells and follicular dendritic cells.;Although both Fcα/μ receptor (Fcα/μR) and polymeric Ig receptor (poly-IgR) are Fc receptors for IgA and IgM and are functionally and genetically related, the expression profile of Fcα/μR is unique. Unlike poly-IgR, Fcα/μR is expressed on marginal zone (MZ) B cells and follicular dendritic cells, suggesting that Fcα/μR plays an important role in humoral immune responses. Fcα/μR mediates endocytosis of the IgM immune complex (IC). Recent research demonstrated that Fcα/μR downregulated retention of the IgM IC with a T-independent (TI) antigen on MZ B cells and follicular dendritic cells due to endocytosis of the IgM IC, suppressing germinal center formation, affinity maturation, and memory B-cell generation in response to TI antigen challenge. In addition, Fcα/μR physically associates with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and augments TLR4 oligomerization and signaling in MZ B cells upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge, leading to increased proinflammatory cytokine production by MZ B cells. Thus, Fcα/μR is a unique Fc receptor that is involved in humoral immune responses and inflammation.  ;polyisoleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
4240;7826625;"Basal components of the transcription apparatus (RNA polymerase II, TATA-binding protein) contain activation domains: is the repetitive C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II a ""portable enhancer domain""?";"Regions rich in serine, threonine, and proline residues can be found in transcriptional activation domains, as well as in the N-terminal parts of mammalian TATA-binding proteins, where they are interrupted by polyglutamine stretches. Likewise, the C-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II contains multiple repeats of the consensus heptapeptide sequence YSPTSPS. To test directly for possible activation functions, we fused the GAL4 DNA-binding domain to the N-terminal domain of human TBP or subdomains of it, and to the C-terminal domain (CTD) of mouse RNA polymerase II or synthetic polymers of a CTD consensus repeat. We found that these chimeric proteins were able to activate transcription when bound to a GAL4 site in front of the TATA box, a function characteristic of transcription factors. However, while subdomains of TBP functioned only from a position close to the TATA box (""promoter"" position), multiple repeats of the CTD consensus sequence were also able to mediate transcriptional activation from a remote (""enhancer"") position. Our findings suggest that a region of TBP that is unique to mammals functionally cooperates with ""proximal"" activation domains of promoter-bound transcription factors. They also imply that the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II includes a function that is otherwise confined to remote activation domains of enhancer-bound transcription factors. We suggest that the CTD of RNA polymerase II contains a ""portable"" remote activation domain that may also facilitate chromatin opening within the transcription unit.

Most tumors are found on chest radiographs, although further evaluation with thoracic computed tomography is performed to stage local disease. Additional radiologic studies, including radionuclide bone scan, brain computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging are typically used in select patients in the search for extrathoracic metastases. More recently, whole body positron emission tomography imaging has become an extremely useful tool in evaluating the primary tumor, regional lymph nodes, and distant sites of disease in lung cancer patients. With continued improvements in diagnostic imaging modalities, definition of risk groups, discovery of molecular markers, and development of new therapeutic strategies, improved survival rates should result in the future.

Theoretical and practical approaches show that, in multicuvettes, a between-well temperature resolution of < 0.05 degrees C can be achieved by multiwavelength photometry with use of the Tris/cresol red indicator system. Using up to three absorbances (A0, A1, A2) measured in the same well at different wavelengths for calculation of differences, quotients, and quotients of differences, we found the optimum temperature signal to be In(A1/A2), with equal-ranking absorbances changing with temperature in opposite directions. We have used the method successfully to measure the temperature profiles and temporal dynamics of temperatures at all positions in two types of multicuvettes under controlled conditions, or not controlled thermostatically.;-;-;-;hard_0
4246;9443770;Bisoprolol and captopril effects on insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity in essential hypertension.;"Angiotension converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers have been reported to possess disparate effects on insulin sensitivity. The aim of this study was to study the effects of the selective beta-1 blocker bisoprolol and of the ACE inhibitor captopril on cellular insulin action in hypertensive individuals. After washout, 12 mild to moderate essential hypertensives were randomized in a double-blind manner to 5 mg bisoprolol daily or 25 mg captopril twice daily for 8 weeks. Erythrocyte insulin binding and insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase (TK) activity were measured before and after therapy. Both agents decreased diastolic blood pressure significantly (bisoprolol 96.5+/-0.9 to 87.8+/-3.1 mm Hg; captopril 96.5+/-0.9 to 91.5+/-1.8 mm Hg; P < .05). Fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and insulin/glucose indices remained unchanged after both therapies, as did lipid profiles. Maximal insulin-stimulated TK activity, assessed by phosphorylation of the exogenous substrate poly-Glu80Tyr20, was significantly higher (P < .05) after bisoprolol treatment, but not after captopril treatment, when compared to placebo (bisoprolol 8.5+/-1.8; captopril 7.3+/-1.5; placebo: 6.4+/-1.3 pmol 32P-ATP/fmol bound insulin). However, captopril, but not bisoprolol, increased the sensitivity of the receptor TK activity, as measured by the half-maximal activity concentration (ED50). Specific insulin binding was not affected by these two agents. Thus, both captopril and bisoprolol may have favorable but different effects on TK activity and insulin action at the cellular level.

4250;16444729;Influence of cranial deformation on facial morphology among prehistoric South Central Andean populations.;"Calculating biodistances among South American populations using cranial measurements is often hindered, as many available skeletal collections exhibit deformation. Acknowledging vault modifications, researchers have sought measurements in other regions which are unaffected by deformation. In the 1970s, a set of 10 ""relatively"" unaffected facial measurements was identified in Argentinean crania that later became the basis of numerous South American biodistance studies. These measurements include: minimum frontal breadth, bizygomatic breadth, orbit height, orbit breadth, palate breath, palate length, upper facial height, basion-prosthion length, nasal height, and nasal breadth. Palate length was excluded from the present analysis due to considerable measurement error. The suitability of these measurements in populations other than Argentineans has not been rigorously tested. Using a sample of 350 prehistoric crania from the Museo Arqueológico San Miguel de Azapa (MASMA, Arica, Chile), this project tested the hypothesis that these measurements are unaffected by either annular or tabular deformation. Results obtained from MANOVA analysis indicate this hypothesis cannot be fully supported. Among males, only 3 of the 9 measurements are unaffected by either form of deformation (palate breadth, basion-prosthion length, and nasal breadth), while analysis of females indicates that 4 of the 9 measurements remain unaltered (minimum frontal breadth, orbit breadth, basion-prosthion length, and nasal breadth). Additionally, analogous to the vault, facial measurements display patterns consistent with the deformation applied. Two implications can be drawn from this research: 1) previous studies using these measurements must be interpreted cautiously, and 2) researchers using these measurements must explicitly test their suitability in each population.";-;-;-;hard_0

4254;21630460;Quantitative chemical proteomics in small-scale culture of phorbol ester stimulated basal breast cancer cells.;Basal-like breast cancers are commonly negative for expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors and HER-2 (triple-negative breast cancer), which makes this subtype of breast cancers more aggressive and less responsive to standard treatment. We have applied a small-scale chemical proteomics method using bisindolylmaleimide (Bis) class of protein kinase C inhibitors to study the Bis-binding proteome in a cell culture model of basal breast carcinoma (MDA-MB-231). Using MS, we identified 174 proteins captured by the Bis-probe in phorbol ester (PMA) stimulated cells. Gene ontology analysis broadly categorised these proteins as ATP binding (42%), GTP binding (6%) and having nucleoside-triphosphatase activity (21%). Of the 64 enzymes captured by the Bis-probe, the majority had either ATP and/or nucleotide binding functions. Two previously unreported Bis binding protein kinases, serine/arginine-rich protein-specific kinase 1 (SRPK1) and interferon-induced RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) were observed. We then incorporated SILAC for quantitation to examine the proteins that were differentially captured by the Bis-probe following 30 and 60 min PMA stimulation. This provided novel evidence for PMA regulation of the enzymes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, nucleolar RNA helicase 2 and Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M. ;polyarginine;phosphatase activity;-;LCR_with_function
4257;8053393;Lithium inhibits calcitriol-stimulated formation of multinucleated cells in human long-term marrow cultures.;"We observed that lithium (3 mM) blocked the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D3]-stimulated bone resorption in fetal rat long bones in culture. Because this inhibitory effect was not seen when bone resorption was stimulated by parathyroid hormone or interleukin-1, we reasoned that Li specifically inhibited events involved in the 1,25-(OH)D3-stimulated bone resorption. The increased bone resorption induced by vitamin D in culture is associated with differentiation and/or fusion of osteoclast progenitors. In the present work, we studied the effect of Li on the basal and 1,25-(OH)2D3-stimulated generation of multinucleated osteoclast-like cells (MNC) and MNC containing tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP+) in long-term human bone marrow cultures. Total MNC and TRAP+ cells were counted after 3 weeks of culture. In the absence of both lithium and 1,25-(OH)2D3, total MNC and TRAP+ cell numbers were 146 +/- 22 and 110 +/- 18 per well, respectively (mean +/- SEM); in the presence of Li, corresponding figures were 79 +/- 17 and 59 +/- 14.

Animals were divided into five groups and treated for 6 hours with either crystalloid (control group), or mannitol, albumin, furosemide, or albumin/furosemide (treatment groups). The cerebral effects of therapy were evaluated by intracranial pressure (ICP) measurements and by postmortem evaluations of water content, using computerized tomography (CT) density measurements and wet-dry weight measurements. The ICP was significantly reduced by all treatments except albumin alone, and was reduced equally by mannitol, furosemide, and albumin/furosemide. The CT density of the lesion area was significantly increased by all treatments. The density of the contralateral nonlesioned hemisphere was significantly increased by all treatments except albumin. The water content of the lesion area was significantly decreased by all treatments; water content of the opposite hemisphere was not significantly reduced. The systemic effects of therapy were evaluated by measuring net fluid balance, wedge pressures, hematocrits, free water clearance, and vasopressin. Negative fluid balance without an increase in hematocrit or in vasopressin secretion occurred only in dogs treated with albumin/furosemide. Such oncodiuretic therapy seems to cause normovolemic dehydration and to have cerebral effects similar to mannitol and furosemide, without their undesirable systemic effects.";-;-;-;hard_0

Evidence that SNF5 affects expression of the cell type-specific genes MF alpha 1 and BAR1 at the RNA level extends the known range of SNF5 function. SNF5 is apparently required for expression of a wide variety of differently regulated genes. A bifunctional SNF5-beta-galactosidase fusion protein was localized in the nucleus by immunofluorescence.

A potential mechanism for this influence is through molecular mimicry. The EBV nuclear antigen EBNA-1 contains a region, PPPGRRP, with considerable homology to the initial sequence targeted by antibodies in Sm B' autoimmunity, PPPGMRPP. This study examined whether immunization of rabbits and mice with peptides containing the PPPGRRP sequence from EBNA-1 constructed on a poly-lysine backbone was able to drive the development of autoantibodies against the Smith antigen (Sm) and the related antigenic complex, the U1 nuclear ribonucleoproteins (nRNPs). PPPGRRP immunization, and immunization with an EBNA-1 fragment containing PPPGRRP, led to autoantibodies in both rabbits and mice at high frequency (83% of rabbits and 43% of mice). Five out of six immunized rabbits developed either leucopenia or lymphopenia or both. The fine specificity of antibody binding against the lupus-associated autoantigens Sm B', nRNP A, and nRNP C after immunization with the EBNA-1-derived peptides was very similar to the early antibody binding patterns against these proteins in human SLE. This similarity, as well as the prevalence of autoimmunity after immunization with these peptides, identifies PPPGRRP as a strong candidate for molecular mimicry in SLE etiology. ;polylysine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
4282;11892787;Intramolecular binding of a proximal PPII helix to an SH3 domain in the fusion protein SH3Hck : PPIIhGAP.;SH3 domains are a conserved feature of many nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases, such as Hck, and often function in substrate recruitment and regulation of kinase activity. SH3 domains modulate kinase activity by binding to polyproline helices (PPII helix) either intramolecularly or in target proteins. The preponderance of bimolecular and distal interactions between SH3 domains and PPII helices led us to investigate whether proximal placement of a PPII helix relative to an SH3 domain would result in tight, intramolecular binding. We have fused the PPII helix region of human GAP to the C-terminus of Hck SH3 and expressed the recombinant fusion protein in Escherichia coli. The fusion protein, SH3Hck : PPIIhGAP, folded spontaneously into a structure in which the PPII helix was bound intramolecularly to the hydrophobic crevice of the SH3 domain. The SH3Hck : PPIIhGAP fusion protein is useful for investigating SH3: PPII helix interactions, for studying concepts in protein folding and design, and may represent a protein structural motif that is widely distributed in nature. ;polyproline;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function

In order to verify the reliability of MULTI(FILT), the pharmacokinetic parameters estimated by MULTI(FILT) were compared with those by MULTI using 100 time courses which were artificially generated according to the Monte Carlo method, based on data for theophylline and bishydroxycoumarin. The estimated pharmacokinetic parameters by MULTI(FILT) agreed with those by MULTI. Thus, it is suggested that FILT, developed in the field of electronic technology, is also useful in the pharmacokinetic field.;-;-;-;hard_0
4291;8020097;Differential evolution of substrates for an RNA enzyme in the presence and absence of its protein cofactor.;Selection of substrates for an RNA enzyme, the catalytic subunit of RNAase P from E. coli, has been carried out by simulation of evolution in vitro in the presence and absence of the protein cofactor of the enzyme. In the presence of the protein, substrates resembling precursor tRNAs, which were readily cleaved by the catalytic RNA, were selected in addition to others, with different sequences and structures (one of which resembled the precursor to 4.5S RNA) that were not readily cleaved by the catalytic RNA alone. The ribonucleoprotein enzyme is more versatile than the RNA enzyme, and our results suggest that it and 4.5S RNA may have evolved after ancestral tRNAs.;-;-;-;hard_0
4292;1360403;MHox: a mesodermally restricted homeodomain protein that binds an essential site in the muscle creatine kinase enhancer.;Myogenic helix-loop-helix (HLH) proteins, such as myogenin and MyoD, can activate muscle-specific transcription when introduced into a variety of nonmuscle cell types. Whereas cells of mesodermal origin are especially permissive to the actions of these myogenic regulators, many other cell types are refractory to myogenic conversion by them. Here we describe a novel homeodomain protein, MHox, that binds an A+T-rich element in the muscle creatine kinase (MCK) enhancer that is essential for muscle-specific transcription and trans-activation by myogenic HLH proteins. MHox is completely restricted to mesodermally derived cell types during embryogenesis and to established cell lines of mesodermal origin. In contrast to most other homeobox genes, MHox expression is excluded from the nervous system, with the highest levels observed in limb bud and visceral arches. In adult mice, MHox is expressed at high levels in skeletal muscle, heart and uterus. The DNA-binding properties and pattern of MHox expression are unique among homeobox genes and suggest a role for MHox as a transcriptional regulator that participates in the establishment of diverse mesodermal cell types.;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
4293;9317120;The SH3 domain of Itk/Emt binds to proline-rich sequences in the cytoplasmic domain of the T cell costimulatory receptor CD28.;Engagement of the transmembrane receptor CD28 potentiates T cell survival, proliferation, and activation. The biochemical basis by which CD28 controls these outcomes is unclear, although early events following cross-linking of the receptor are characterized by tyrosine phosphorylation of CD28 and other cellular substrates. We demonstrate that following CD28 ligation, a CD28-associated tyrosine kinase activity is increased in parallel to activation of the T cell-specific tyrosine kinase Itk (Itk/Emt), while Lck and Fyn kinase activities are not increased. We show that Itk forms an inducible complex with CD28, mediated by the SH3 domain of Itk and the diproline motifs of CD28. Site-directed mutagenesis of the N-terminal diproline motif of CD28 abrogates the association of CD28 with the SH3 domain of Itk, while mutations within the C-terminal diproline motif have little effect. Peptides corresponding to the N-terminal diproline motif were more efficient at abrogating the interaction between CD28 and the SH3 domain of Itk, than peptides corresponding to the C-terminal diproline motif. In addition, peptides corresponding to the N-terminal diproline motif of CD28 activated the tyrosine kinase activity of Itk to levels similar to those observed following Ab-mediated cross-linking of CD28. Together, our data show that the SH3 domain of Itk binds to a proline-rich motif within the cytoplasmic tail of CD28, and define a mechanism by which CD28 couples to and activates a downstream tyrosine kinase.;polyproline;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
4295;8065507;The effect of a free radical scavenger and platelet-activating factor antagonist on FFA accumulation in post-ischemic canine brain.;The effects of the platelet-activating factor antagonist BN 50739 and a free radical scavenger dimethyl sulfoxide on the accumulation of free fatty acids in post-ischemic canine brain are reported. Following 14 min of complete normothermic ischemia and 60 min of reperfusion, the total brain FFAs were approximately 150% higher than in the control group (p < 0.05). Perfusion with the platelet-activating factor antagonist BN50739 in its diluent dimethyl sulfoxide during 60 min of post-ischemic reoxygenation resulted in a 61.8% (p < 0.01) reduction in the total brain free fatty acid accumulation. Palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, and arachidonic acids decreased by 53.8%, 63.5%, 69.0%, 47.4%, and 57.2%, respectively. Although dimethyl sulfoxide alone caused stearic and arachidonic acids to return to the normal concentration range, BN 50739 had a significant influence on recovery of palmitic, oleic, and linoleic acids and was previously shown to provide significant therapeutic protection against damage to brain mitochondria following an ischemic episode. Because free fatty acid accumulation is one of the early phenomena in cerebral ischemia, this study provides evidence to support the hypothesis that both platelet-activating factor and free radicals are involved in initiating cerebral ischemic injury.;-;-;-;hard_0
4297;6681635;Suppressed release of LH in ovariectomized post-partum ewes.;The patterns of LH release were studied in 5 ewes, ovariectomized when 3 days post partum, at 4, 14, 33, 47 and 61 days after ovariectomy. These patterns were compared with those in 4 seasonally anoestrous (control) ewes ovariectomized and sampled at the same times. In the control ewes regular pulsatile release of LH was apparent 4 days after ovariectomy: plasma LH concentrations and LH pulse frequencies, but not pulse amplitudes, then declined. In the post-partum ewes all indices of LH release were lower than those in the control ewes at 4 days after ovariectomy, but then they increased: pulse amplitude was greater (P less than 0.05) at 14 days after ovariectomy, and plasma LH concentrations were greater (P less than 0.05, 0.01) at 14 and 33 days than in control ewes. These results indicate that the hypothalamopituitary axis of lactating ewes has a reduced capacity to release LH for only a short period after ovariectomy early in the post-partum period. This probably reflects the time needed for recovery from the inhibitory effects of ovarian and placental hormones, and may reflect reduced secretion of LH-RH.;-;-;-;hard_0
4305;18818359;Antigen recognition by variable lymphocyte receptors.;Variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) rather than antibodies play the primary role in recognition of antigens in the adaptive immune system of jawless vertebrates. Combinatorial assembly of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) gene segments achieves the required repertoire for antigen recognition. We have determined a crystal structure for a VLR-antigen complex, VLR RBC36 in complex with the H-antigen trisaccharide from human blood type O erythrocytes, at 1.67 angstrom resolution. RBC36 binds the H-trisaccharide on the concave surface of the LRR modules of the solenoid structure where three key hydrophilic residues, multiple van der Waals interactions, and the highly variable insert of the carboxyl-terminal LRR module determine antigen recognition and specificity. The concave surface assembled from the most highly variable regions of the LRRs, along with diversity in the sequence and length of the highly variable insert, can account for the recognition of diverse antigens by VLRs. ;polyleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

4314;8189428;Association of acetylcholine receptors with peripheral membrane proteins: evidence from antibody-induced coaggregation.;Acetylcholine receptors (AChR) are associated with several peripheral membrane proteins that are concentrated on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane at the neuromuscular junction, and at aggregates of AChR that form in vitro. We tested the linkage among these proteins by inducing microaggregation of AChR, then determining if a given peripheral membrane protein accumulated with the receptors in microaggregates. In most experiments, we used isolated membrane fragments that are rich in AChR and accessible to antibodies against intracellular antigens. We showed that the 43 kD receptor-associated protein always aggregated with AChR, whether microaggregation was driven by antibodies to the 43 kD protein, or to the receptor itself. Antibodies to the 58 kD receptor-associated protein also always aggregated the 58 kD protein with the receptor. Our results are consistent with a model for AChR-rich membrane in which the 43 kD and 58 kD proteins are both closely associated with the AChR. When we induced microaggregation in intact muscle cells with anti-AChR antibodies, our results were less definitive. The 43 kD receptor-associated protein microaggregated with AChR, but the 58 kD protein was not especially enriched at AChR microaggregates. We discuss the advantages of using isolated AChR-rich membrane fragments to study the association of AChR with peripheral membrane proteins.;polyarginine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
4323;11230806;Functional analysis of activation and repression domains of the rainbow trout aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (rtARNT) protein isoforms.;The aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) protein is involved in many signaling pathways. Rainbow trout express isoforms of ARNT protein that are divergent in their C-terminal domains due to alternative RNA splicing. Rainbow trout ARNT(b) (rtARNT(b)) contains a C-terminal domain rich in glutamine and asparagine (QN), whereas the C-terminal domain of rtARNT(a) is rich in proline, serine, and threonine (PST). rtARNT(b) functions positively in AH receptor-mediated signaling, whereas rtARNT(a) functions negatively. Studies were performed to understand how changes in the C-terminal domains of the two rtARNT isoforms affect function. Deletion of the QN-rich C-terminal domain of rtARNT(b) did not affect function in aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)-mediated signaling, whereas deletion of the PST-rich domain of rtARNT(a) restored function. Expression of the PST-rich domain on truncated rtARNT(b) or mouse ARNT (mARNT) reduced function of this protein by 50-80%. Gel shift assays revealed that the PST-rich domain affected AHR-mediated signaling by inhibiting DNA binding of the AHR*ARNT heterodimer. Gal4 transactivation assays revealed a potent transactivation domain in the QN-rich domain of rtARNT(b). In contrast, Gal4 proteins containing the PST-rich domain of rtARNT(a) did not transactivate because the proteins did not bind to DNA. Secondary structure analysis of the PST-rich domain revealed hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. Truncation of the hydrophobic domain that spanned the final 20-40 amino acids of the rtARNT(a) restored function to the protein, suggesting that repressor function was related to protein misfolding or masking of the basic DNA binding domain. Functional diversity within the C-terminal domain is consistent with other negatively acting transcription factors and illustrates a common biological theme. ;polyasparagine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
4327;30356962;Proteoliposome Engineering with Cell-Free Membrane Protein Synthesis: Control of Membrane Protein Sorting into Liposomes by Chaperoning Systems.;"Integral membrane proteins (IMPs) modulate key cellular processes; their dysfunctions are closely related to disease. However, production of IMPs in active conformations for further study is hindered by aggregation and toxicity in living expression systems. IMPs are therefore produced in cell-free systems employing liposome chaperoning, but membrane integration of the nascent IMPs is suboptimal and orientation of the integrated proteins remains uncontrollable. Thus, an artificial membrane protein sorting system is developed, based on polyhistidine/nickel-chelate affinity, combined with cell-free membrane protein synthesis. Its proof of concept is demonstrated with a N-terminal hexahistadine-fused conexin-43 (NHis-Cx43) model IMP. Nickel-chelating liposomes efficiently incorporate twofold newly synthesized NHis-Cx43 compared with Cx43. NHis-Cx43, when synthesized in this system, forms dye-permeable hemichannels, similar to plasma membrane pores formed by Cx43 in cells. The topology of incorporated NHis-Cx43 indicates two orientations in the liposomal membranes. However, NHis-Cx43 orientation is controlled, resulting in single topology, by combination of the natural molecular chaperone DnaKJE. Successful synthesis and at least 4.5-fold increase lipid incorporation are also achieved with three other NHis-fused IMPs, including α-helix and β-barrel IMPs. Overall, this simple membrane protein sorting system is usable combined with molecular chaperones to prepare proteoliposomes for many applications. ";polyhistidine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
4329;17959650;Replication protein A prevents accumulation of single-stranded telomeric DNA in cells that use alternative lengthening of telomeres.;The activation of a telomere maintenance mechanism is required for cancer development in humans. While most tumors achieve this by expressing the enzyme telomerase, a fraction (5-15%) employs a recombination-based mechanism termed alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). Here we show that loss of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein replication protein A (RPA) in human ALT cells, but not in telomerase-positive cells, causes increased exposure of single-stranded G-rich telomeric DNA, cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase, accumulation of single-stranded telomeric DNA within ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs), and formation of telomeric aggregates at the ends of metaphase chromosomes. This study demonstrates differences between ALT cells and telomerase-positive cells in the requirement for RPA in telomere processing and implicates the ALT mechanism in tumor cells as a possible therapeutic target. ;polyglycine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Recent work has suggested that the gro protein functions as a transcriptional corepressor during Drosophila development. We therefore examined possible roles of the mouse Grg protein in DNA binding and in vitro transcription. No sequence-specific DNA binding activity was detected by polymerase chain reaction-DNA binding site selection nor was the glutamine-rich Grg protein capable of acting as an activation domain in an in vivo transactivation assay. However, depletion of Grg protein from HeLa nuclear extracts inhibited the in vitro transcription activity of the extracts. We suggest that Grg protein may interact with components of the basal transcription machinery. ;polyglutamine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
4331;10078890;Management and outcome of acute myocardial infarction in older patients in the thrombolytic era.;"OBJECTIVE
Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is an important cause of mortality and morbidity in older patients. The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of unselected admissions with AMI that is older than 75 years and to examine management and outcomes in this group.


DESIGN
An historical cohort study of consecutive unselected admissions with AMI identified using the Hospital In Patient Enquiry (HIPE) database and validated according to MONICA criteria for definite or probable AMI.


SETTING
An acute cardiac unit in a university teaching hospital/cardiac tertiary referral center.


RESULTS
Of 1059 patients, 606 (57%) were older than 65 years and 309 (29.2%) were older than 75 years. Mean age in this group was 80.5 years. Hospital mortality was almost twice as high as in patients younger than 75 years (28% vs 15%, P < .001), and age was an independent predictor of short- and long-term mortality following AMI. Women constituted a significantly higher proportion of older patients. Family history of AMI and cigarette smoking were less prevalent in older patients. Mean cholesterol was lower and comorbidities were higher. Other baseline characteristics, including previous AMI, did not differ. However older patients were less likely to receive thrombolysis (13% vs 36%, P < .001), aspirin (76% vs 86%, P < .01), or beta-blockers (25% vs 51%, P < .001) and were less likely to undergo cardiac catheterization or revascularization. Only 53% were admitted to coronary care.


CONCLUSION
Patients more than age 75 comprise almost one-third of patients with AMI and have a poor prognosis. Although age is an independent predictor of mortality following AMI, suboptimal management may contribute to the high mortality in these patients.";-;-;-;hard_0
4332;15608653;Crystal structure of the polysialic acid-degrading endosialidase of bacteriophage K1F.;Phages infecting the polysialic acid (polySia)-encapsulated human pathogen Escherichia coli K1 are equipped with capsule-degrading tailspikes known as endosialidases, which are the only identified enzymes that specifically degrade polySia. As polySia also promotes cellular plasticity and tumor metastasis in vertebrates, endosialidases are widely applied in polySia-related neurosciences and cancer research. Here we report the crystal structures of endosialidase NF and its complex with oligomeric sialic acid. The structure NF, which reveals three distinct domains, indicates that the unique polySia specificity evolved from a combination of structural elements characteristic of exosialidases and bacteriophage tailspike proteins. The endosialidase assembles into a catalytic trimer stabilized by a triple beta-helix. Its active site differs markedly from that of exosialidases, indicating an endosialidase-specific substrate-binding mode and catalytic mechanism. Residues essential for endosialidase activity were identified by structure-based mutational analysis. ;polyserine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
4334;2477452;A protective monoclonal antibody recognizes an epitope in the carboxyl-terminal cysteine-rich domain in the precursor of the major merozoite surface antigen of the rodent malarial parasite, Plasmodium yoelii.;The 195-kDa major merozoite surface antigen of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf PMMSA) is a potential candidate for the development of a blood-stage malarial vaccine. We have focused on an analogous 230-kDa Ag of the rodent malarial parasite, Plasmodium yoelii, in an effort to study this protein in an experimental model system. Previously we reported the cloning and sequencing of a 2.1-kb portion of the gene encoding the carboxyl-terminal 77 kDa of the Py PMMSA. This region contained the B cell epitope recognized by mAb 302, a mAb shown to protect mice passively against P. yoelii challenge infection. To localize this B cell epitope, we have inserted various restriction fragments of the cloned Py PMMSA sequence into the bacterial expression vector pMG27NSTerm. Recombinant peptides of 74, 40, 34, 17, and 10 kDa have been produced which bear the epitope recognized by mAb 302. The results demonstrate that this B cell epitope is located within the most carboxyl-region of the Py PMMSA which contains a series of ten cysteine residues, also found in the PMMSA of P. falciparum. Further analysis showed that the reduction of disulfide bonds as well as the deletion of CYS-607 of the cloned sequence, resulted in the loss of the expression of this epitope. It is of interest that this epitope does not appear to be a dominant B cell determinant of the Py PMMSA molecule during infection. Inasmuch as this cysteine-rich domain of Py PMMSA displays considerable homology with that of Pf PMMSA, our data suggest that this region of the Pf PMMSA should be considered for inclusion in the development of a blood-stage vaccine. ;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
4335;8288579;The transcription factor HNF1 acts with C/EBP alpha to synergistically activate the human albumin promoter through a novel domain.;HNF1 and C/EBP alpha are transcription factors that bind to and trans-activate the human albumin gene proximal promoter. Various 5' deletions of the human albumin promoter were coupled to a luciferase reporter gene (alb-luc constructs) and co-electroporated with HNF1 and/or C/EBP alpha expression vectors into HeLa cells. Luciferase activities from co-electroporation of the HNF1 and C/EBP alpha expression vectors with the alb-luc constructs were approximately 10-fold greater than the sum of the activities achieved with HNF1 and C/EBP alpha alone. Analysis of COOH-terminal or internal deletions of the HNF1 expression vector revealed that the domain important for collaborative interaction with C/EBP alpha could be localized to a 157 amino acid region not previously described. This domain is proline and glutamine-rich and is highly homologous (66%) to a portion of vHNF1, an evolutionarily related gene first identified in dedifferentiated hepatoma cells. A construct linking the negatively charged activation domain of herpes simplex virus protein VP16 to the DNA-binding domain of HNF1 showed that it could also synergize with C/EBP alpha to trans-activate the human albumin gene promoter. Our studies delineate a domain in HNF1 important for synergistic activation with C/EBP alpha. ;polyglutamine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

Although it has been well known that CIITA (MHC class II transactivator), an NLR (nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-repeat containing) protein, as a master regulator of MHC class II gene expression, the mechanism of MHC class I gene transactivation was unclear. Recently, another NLR protein, NLRC5 (NLR family, CARD domain-containing 5), was identified as an MHC class I transactivator (CITA). NLRC5 is a critical regulator for the transcriptional activation of MHC class I genes and other genes involved in the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway. CITA/NLRC5 plays a crucial role in human cancer immunity through the recruitment and activation of tumor killing CD8+ T cells. Here, we discuss the molecular function and mechanism of CITA/NLRC5 in the MHC class I pathway and its role in cancer. ;polyleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

Photodetectors are one of the latest additions in an expanding list of applications of this fascinating family of materials. The extensive range of possible inorganic and hybrid perovskites coupled with their processing versatility and ability to convert external stimuli into easily measurable optical/electrical signals makes them an auspicious sensing element even for the high-energy domain of the electromagnetic spectrum.

4341;8628299;Interactions among SR proteins, an exonic splicing enhancer, and a lentivirus Rev protein regulate alternative splicing.;"We examine here the roles of cellular splicing factors and virus regulatory proteins in coordinately regulating alternative splicing of the tat/rev mRNA of equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV). This bicistronic mRNA contains four exons; exons 1 and 2 encode Tat, and exons 3 and 4 encode Rev. In the absence of Rev expression, the four-exon mRNA is synthesized exclusively, but when Rev is expressed, exon 3 is skipped to produce an mRNA that contains only exons 1, 2, and 4. We identify a purine-rich exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) in exon 3 that promotes exon inclusion. Similar to other cellular ESEs that have been identified by other laboratories, the EIAV ESE interacted specifically with SR proteins, a group of serine/arginine-rich splicing factors that function in constitutive and alternative mRNA splicing. Substitution of purines with pyrimidines in the ESE resulted in a switch from exon inclusion to exon skipping in vivo and abolished binding of SR proteins in vitro. Exon skipping was also induced by expression of EIAV Rev. We show that Rev binds to exon 3 RNA in vitro, and while the precise determinants have not been mapped, Rev function in vivo and RNA binding in vitro indicate that the RNA element necessary for Rev responsiveness overlaps or is adjacent to the ESE. We suggest that EIAV Rev promotes exon skipping by interfering with SR protein interactions with RNA or with other splicing factors.";polyarginine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
4344;20810664;Crystal structure of the Src family kinase Hck SH3-SH2 linker regulatory region supports an SH3-dominant activation mechanism.;"Most mammalian cell types depend on multiple Src family kinases (SFKs) to regulate diverse signaling pathways. Strict control of SFK activity is essential for normal cellular function, and loss of kinase regulation contributes to several forms of cancer and other diseases. Previous x-ray crystal structures of the SFKs c-Src and Hck revealed that intramolecular association of their Src homology (SH) 3 domains and SH2 kinase linker regions has a key role in down-regulation of kinase activity. However, the amino acid sequence of the Hck linker represents a suboptimal ligand for the isolated SH3 domain, suggesting that it may form the polyproline type II helical conformation required for SH3 docking only in the context of the intact structure. To test this hypothesis directly, we determined the crystal structure of a truncated Hck protein consisting of the SH2 and SH3 domains plus the linker. Despite the absence of the kinase domain, the structures and relative orientations of the SH2 and SH3 domains in this shorter protein were very similar to those observed in near full-length, down-regulated Hck. However, the SH2 kinase linker adopted a modified topology and failed to engage the SH3 domain. This new structure supports the idea that these noncatalytic regions work together as a ""conformational switch"" that modulates kinase activity in a manner unique to the SH3 domain and linker topologies present in the intact Hck protein. Our results also provide fresh structural insight into the facile induction of Hck activity by HIV-1 Nef and other Hck SH3 domain binding proteins and implicate the existence of innate conformational states unique to individual Src family members that ""fine-tune"" their sensitivities to activation by SH3-based ligands.

The fine structure of this alternative poly(A) site was determined by cDNA sequence and 3' S1 analyses. Cleavage-poly(A) was found to be heterogeneous, occurring at multiple CA dinucleotides downstream from the AATAAA signal sequence. About 50% of the alternative poly(A) takes place upstream from the middle T-Ag stop codon. In addition, the pattern of splicing of transcripts with the alternative poly(A) site differed from that with the major poly(A) site at the end of the early region. The ratio of the small and middle T-Ag splices to the large T-Ag splice for the alternative poly(A)+ mRNAs is about 2.5 times that found for mRNAs with the major poly(A) site. The altered splicing pattern and 3'-end heterogeneity of the alternative poly(A)+ mRNAs would result in preferential translation of small T-Ag (to a greater degree) and middle T-Ag over large T-Ag at later times in the polyomavirus lytic cycle.; polyalanine ;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

The gestation treatment diets were 1) corn-soybean meal fed at 1.8 kg/d (control), 2) CGF plus soybean meal fed at 2.3 kg/d (CGF-low) and 3) CGF plus soybean meal fed at 2.6 kg/d (CGF-high). The CGF diets contained 92.2% and 93.7% CGF, respectively. Feeding levels of Diets 2 and 3 were based on the assumption that CGF had 80% and 70% of the net energy value of corn, respectively. All sows had ad libitum access to a conventional corn-soybean meal diet during lactation and were fed 3.2 kg/d during breeding. Intakes of gestation treatment diets were increased 25% during winter months. Based on litter size and weight, the performance of sows fed CGF did not differ from that of the sows fed the control diet. Mean number of pigs at birth and 21 d (weaning) for the three parities were: (control) 10.16, 7.65; (CGF-low) 11.30, 8.44; (CGF-high) 10.73, 8.13, respectively. Pigs from CGF-fed sows were smaller at birth (P less than .05), but subsequent pig weights did not differ. Mean pig birth and 21-d weights for the three parities were: (control) 1.44, 5.18; (CGF-low) 1.30, 4.84; (CGF-high) 1.31, 5.01 kg, respectively. CGF-low sows weighed less (P less than .01) at d 109 of gestation than did the control and CGF-high sows, which did not differ in weight.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)";-;-;-;hard_0
4355;9705007;In vitro antiplasmodial activity of stem and root extracts of Nauclea latifolia S.M. (Rubiaceae).;Aqueous extracts from Nauclea latifolia S.M. (Rubiaceae), a plant commonly used in Ivory Coast by traditional healers for the treatment of malaria, were tested on two strains of Plasmodium faliparum: FcB1-Colombia (chloroquine-resistant) and a Nigerian strain (chloroquine-sensitive). The extracts were obtained from stems and roots of the plant in two forms, infusion and decoction, both methods used by most traditional healers. The in vitro activity of N. latifolia extracts on P. falciparum was assessed both visually and by a radioactive method. The visual analysis allowed determination of the time of extract action on the erythrocytic cycle, as well as the parasitic stage of most inhibitory effect. Similar results were obtained applying fresh, frozen or lyophilized extracts. The IC50 values determined were within the range already reported for other antimalarial plants such as Azadirachta indica A. Juss (Meliaceae) or Artemisia annua L. (Asteraceae). Aqueous extracts of N. latifolia inhibited P. falciparum (FcB1 strain) mainly at the end of the erythrocytic cycle (32nd to 48th hour).;-;-;-;hard_0
4362;34620745;LncRNA PCAT6 activated by SP1 facilitates the progression of breast cancer by the miR-326/LRRC8E axis.;Breast cancer is an aggressive malignancy with high morbidity in females worldwide. Extensive studies reveal that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are abnormally expressed and act as key regulators in various cancers, including breast cancer. In this work, we investigated the role and regulatory mechanism of lncRNA prostate cancer-associated transcript 6 (PCAT6) in breast cancer progression. Our findings revealed that PCAT6 was overexpressed in breast cancer tissues and cell lines. Furthermore, elevation of PCAT6 reflected an adverse prognosis of patients. Functional experiments indicated that PCAT6 knockdown hampered cell proliferation, facilitated apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in vitro, and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. We also found that the transcription factor SP1 could bind to the PCAT6 promoter and promoted its expression. Subsequently, it was verified that PCAT6 was a molecular sponge for microRNA-326 (miR-326), and the leucine-rich repeat containing the eight family member E (LRRC8E) was a direct target of miR-326. Rescue assays revealed that LRRC8E overexpression attenuated the suppressive effect of PCAT6 knockdown on cellular progression of breast cancer. In summary, this study demonstrated that SP1-activated PCAT6 promoted the malignant behaviors of breast cancer cells by regulating the miR-326/LRRC8E axis.;polyleucine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
4364;9670537;Amplitude and period discrimination of haptic stimuli.;As part of a project to examine the ability of the hand to receive speech information, the present study examined subjects' ability to discriminate finger movements along the dimensions of amplitude and period (movement duration). The movements consisted of single-cycle, sinewave movements and single-cycle, cosine movements presented to the index finger. Difference thresholds were collected using an adaptive, two-interval, temporal forced-choice procedure. Amplitudes from 6 to 19 mm were examined, and the difference thresholds ranged from 10% to 18%. The thresholds were unaffected by the period of the movement. Periods from 3000 to 111 ms (0.33-9 Hz) were examined, and thresholds ranged from 6% to 16%. The thresholds were unaffected by the amplitude of the movement. Further measurements in which period was varied in the amplitude discrimination task and amplitude was varied in the period discrimination task indicated that subjects were not using peak velocity as the basis for discrimination. These measurements were collected using a display specifically designed for the examination of haptic stimulation and capable of presenting controlled patterns of movement and vibration to the fingers.;-;-;-;hard_0
4366;1984673;Subcellular distribution of [3H]-dexamethasone mesylate binding sites in Leydig cells using electron microscope radioautography.;"The present view is that glucocorticoid hormones bind to their cytoplasmic receptors before reaching their nuclear target sites, which include specific DNA sequences. Although it is believed that cytoplasmic sequestration of steroid receptors and other transcription factors (such as NFKB) may regulate the overall activity of these factors, there is little information on the exact subcellular sites of steroid receptors or even of any other transcription factors. Tritiated (3H)-dexamethasone 21-mesylate (DM) is an affinity label that binds covalently to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), thereby allowing morphological localization of the receptor at the light and electron microscope levels as well as for quantitative radioautographic (RAG) analysis. After injection of 3H-DM into the testis, a specific radioautographic signal was observed in Leydig cells, which correlated with a high level of immunocytochemically demonstrable GR in these cells at the light-microscope level. To localize the 3H-DM binding sites at the electron microscope (EM) level, the testes of 5 experimental and 3 control adrenalectomized rats were injected directly with 20 microCi 3H-DM; control rats received simultaneously a 25-fold excess of unlabeled dexamethasone; 15 min later, rats were fixed with glutaraldehyde and the tissue was processed for EM RAG analysis combined with quantitative morphometry. The radioautographs showed that the cytosol, nucleus, smooth endoplasmic reticulum (sER), and mitochondria were labeled. Since the cytosol was always adjacent to tubules of the sER, the term sER-rich cytosol was used to represent label over sER networks, which may also represent cytosol labeling due to the limited resolution of the radioautographic technique. Labeling was highest in sER-rich cytosol and mitochondria, at 53% and 31% of the total, respectively. Cytosol (exclusively of all organelles) and nucleus showed comparatively weak labeling, at 9% and 7%, respectively. This study thus clearly establishes with the electron microscope, the localization of glucocorticoid binding sites using DM. It remains to be determined whether or not these DM binding sites represent bona fide glucocorticoid receptors or nonreceptor proteins that bind DM. Whereas the functional significance of the subcellular distribution of DM is not known, the labeling of the cytosol may represent localization of the steroid and GR in their traditional compartment. The steroid antagonistic properties of DM may have prevented the DM-GR complexes from translocating to the nucleus. However, the significant labeling of the sER-rich cytosol and mitochondria was unexpected and raises intriguing questions that are being addressed in current studies.";polyarginine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
4367;10100798;Day-case haemorrhoidectomy.;"BACKGROUND
Ligation excision haemorrhoidectomy is usually performed on an inpatient basis. This study was designed to assess the feasibility of day-case haemorrhoidectomy.


METHODS
Patients fulfilling criteria for day surgery underwent ligation excision haemorrhoidectomy with the intention of a same-day discharge from hospital. A standardized protocol for anaesthesia, perioperative analgesia and antiemesis was followed. Patients received daily home nursing visits until they felt both comfortable and confident. Staff recorded pain and nausea scores on a visual analogue scale (range 1-10) until the first bowel action. Patient satisfaction was assessed independently after operation.


RESULTS
Fifty-one patients underwent planned day-case haemorrhoidectomy. Forty-two (82 per cent) were discharged on the day of surgery. All patients were discharged within 26 h of surgery. Four patients required readmission, two with reactive bleeding, one with urinary retention and one for pain control. Pain and nausea were well controlled. Forty-four patients (86 per cent) were totally or very satisfied with their overall care.


CONCLUSION
Ligation excision haemorrhoidectomy can be performed successfully as a day-case procedure.";-;-;-;hard_0

4374;8200168;Tuberculous arthritis in children. Diagnosis by needle biopsy of the synovium.;In two children ages 8 months and 4 years, tuberculous synovitis of the knee was suggested by pathologic examination of synovial tissue obtained through needle biopsy. Culture of the biopsy material was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in one case. In this child, the tuberculin test was negative, in the absence of anergy, at the time the child was first evaluated, and the primary lung lesion was not identified by the radiologist. Tuberculous synovitis has not previously been recognized as part of primary tuberculosis during the early weeks when the tuberculin skin test may be negative. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a sensitive modality for demonstrating joint fluid, synovial hypertrophy, and associated osteomyelitis, if present. With the increasing frequency of cases of tuberculosis in the population, greater awareness of the risk of tuberculous arthritis in childhood is important in order to recognize this unusual presentation. If negative early on, the tuberculin skin test should be repeated after 6 weeks of arthritis. A needle biopsy of the synovium is helpful and appropriate in all children with monoarticular arthritis who have a positive tuberculin skin test.;-;-;-;hard_0
4378;24499806;Toward the development of monoclonal antibody-based assays to probe virion-like epitopes in hepatitis B vaccine antigen.;"Prophylactic vaccines against hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection were produced in different expression systems under different processing conditions. Since the recombinant HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) in these vaccines is a cysteine-rich protein with 14 cysteines among a total of 226 amino acids, the epitopes are dependent on the formation of intra- and intermolecular disulfide bonds. A panel of 22 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were developed and evaluated with respect to their sensitivity to disulfide reduction treatment of recombinant HBsAg. Not surprisingly, different mAbs showed different degree of sensitivity to controlled HBsAg disulfide reduction. With a view to exploring the functionality of anti-HBsAg mAbs to be used in HBsAg quality analysis, in vitro neutralization activity for the mAbs was assessed. One of the mAbs tested, 5F11, which showed high sensitivity to the disulfide integrity in HBsAg, was shown also to be highly effective in neutralizing HBV in vitro. Conversely, 42B6, while exhibiting similar neutralization activity, showed comparable binding HBsAg with or without reduction treatment. Based on these mAb characteristics, a sandwich ELISA with 42B6 being the capture Ab and detection Ab was developed to quantify HBsAg (like a ""mass"" assay) during antigen bioprocessing or in vaccine products. In parallel, when 5F11 was used as the detection Ab (with the same capture Ab), the assay can be used to probe disulfide-dependent and virion-like epitopes in intermediates or final products of hepatitis B vaccine, serving as a surrogate marker for vaccine efficacy to elicit neutralizing antibodies. This approach enables the comparative epitope specific antigenicity analysis of HBsAg antigen preparations from different sources.  ";polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
4379;12714591;Hsp105alpha suppresses the aggregation of truncated androgen receptor with expanded CAG repeats and cell toxicity.;Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine tract in the androgen receptor (AR). The N-terminal fragment of AR containing the expanded polyglutamine tract aggregates in cytoplasm and/or in nucleus and induces cell death. Some chaperones such as Hsp40 and Hsp70 have been identified as important regulators of polyglutamine aggregation and/or cell death in neuronal cells. Recently, Hsp105alpha, expressed at especially high levels in mammalian brain, has been shown to suppress apoptosis in neuronal cells and prevent the aggregation of protein caused by heat shock in vitro. However, its role in polyglutamine-mediated cell death and toxicity has not been studied. In the present study, we examined the effects of Hsp105alpha on the aggregation and cell toxicity caused by expansion of the polyglutamine tract using a cellular model of SBMA. The transient expression of truncated ARs (tARs) containing an expanded polyglutamine tract caused aggregates to form in COS-7 and SK-N-SH cells and concomitantly apoptosis in the cells with the nuclear aggregates. When Hsp105alpha was overexpressed with tAR97 in the cells, Hsp105alpha was colocalized to aggregates of tAR97, and the aggregation and cell toxicity caused by expansion of the polyglutamine tract were markedly reduced. Both beta-sheet and alpha-helix domains, but not the ATPase domain, of Hsp105alpha were necessary to suppress the formation of aggregates in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, Hsp105alpha was found to localize in nuclear inclusions formed by ARs containing an expanded polyglutamine tract in tissues of patients and transgenic mice with SBMA. These findings suggest that overexpression of Hsp105alpha suppresses cell death caused by expansion of the polyglutamine tract without chaperone activity, and the enhanced expression of the essential domains of Hsp105alpha in brain may provide an effective therapeutic approach for CAG repeat diseases. ;polyglutamine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
4387;1317347;Nucleotide sequence of the cDNA and the derived amino acid sequence for the major antigenic protein of foot and mouth disease virus, type Asia 1 63/72.;"A 0.9 kb cDNA for the foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) type Asia 1 63/72, cloned in the plasmid pUR222 by dC/dG tailing method, was expressed into a protein which was immunogenic in guinea pigs and cattle. The protein purified to homogeneity was found to be basic and of 38 kDa. A sequence of 879 nucleotides of the inserted cDNA was obtained. The nucleotide sequence was 65% GC-rich and was homologous to the gene for VPI of FMDV types A5, OIK and C3 to the extent of 35-40%. From the nucleotide sequence, a sequence of 293 amino acids was derived which contained 43 arginine, 4 lysine, 7 glutamic acid and 18 aspartic acid residues making the protein highly basic. The molecular weight was calculated to be 31.6 kDa. The 38 kDa protein produced by the cloned cDNA is a fused protein composed of the 293 amino acids; 5 and 55 amino acids of the alpha-complementation protein of the beta-galactosidase at the N and C terminal, respectively, and 5 amino acid coded by the dG/dC tails used for cloning the cDNA.

4392;9696367;Prophylaxis and treatment of neoplastic meningeosis in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.;The introduction of cranial radiotherapy (CRT) has provided efficient control of overt or subclinical meningeosis in acute leukemia. Especially due to the long-term toxicity of CRT, reduction or elimination of radiotherapy appeared mandatory after cure rates of more than 70% had been achieved in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Several large clinical trials of the Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM) Study Group with more than 3500 patients since 1981 have demonstrated that intensive systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy without or with limited CRT can efficiently prevent central nervous system (CNS) relapses in a large percentage of patients. However, only in low-risk patients prophylactic radiotherapy can be completely and safely replaced by conventional doses of methotrexate. In addition, reduction of chemotherapy in low-risk ALL increased the rate of relapses with CNS involvement. Thus, only a combination of multidrug induction, high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) consolidation, and reintensification allowed safe elimination of CRT in low-risk ALL. This approach combined with CRT with 12Gy and 18 Gy in medium and high risk ALL, respectively, reduced the incidence of relapses with CNS involvement to less than 5% (trial ALL-BFM 86). Patients with inadequate response to therapy, or with T-cell ALL, or with overt CNS disease are at particularly high risk for relapse with CNS involvement, and require more systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy combined with cranial irradiation. In B-cell ALL, short intensive chemotherapy pulses including HD-MTX could completely replace radiotherapy. In AML, post-consolidation CRT appears to be advantageous with regard to control of extramedullary as well as systemic relapses.;-;-;-;hard_0
4393;12967612;Out of South America? Additional evidence for a southern origin of melanopline grasshoppers.;Molecular phylogenetic methods provide a useful tool for critically evaluating competing biogeographic hypotheses. This paper focuses on conjectures at the intercontinental level. An earlier phylogeographic study of the grasshopper subfamily Melanoplinae examined relationships among taxa occupying the Americas and Eurasia. The objective was to test which of three scenarios best described the subfamily's origins and patterns of intercontinental movement. It was tentatively proposed that the melanopline grasshoppers evolved somewhere in the Americas and spread to the Old World. The present article, by including additional Neotropical species, not only upholds that conjecture, but is able to identify South America as the site of origin. Phylogenetic analysis indicates a direction of dispersal: South America-->North America-->Eurasia, that is opposite to what was previously believed. This study also provides, for the first time, a preliminary molecular phylogeny of selected South American melanopline genera.;-;-;-;hard_0
4394;3208764;Isolation and characterization of the bovine kappa-casein gene.;1. The bovine kappa-casein gene has been isolated as a series of overlapping lambda clones and shown to consist of five exons distributed over a total length of approximately 13 kb. Most of the mature protein-coding sequence is contained in a single large exon. 2. Approximately 65% of the gene has been sequenced together with portions of the 5'- and 3'-flanking sequences. The immediate 5'-flanking sequence contains several motifs which are characteristic of upstream regions including a TATA box, a CAAT box, a sequence similar to that recognized by transcription factor AP-1 and a purine-rich sequence resembling that found upstream in all other lactoprotein genes. Other possible regulatory sequences are found upstream of exon 4. 3. The organization of the kappa-casein gene, together with its upstream sequence, confirms previous conclusions that it is unrelated to the calcium-sensitive-casein gene family to which it is linked. Evidence is presented which supports a previous suggestion that kappa-casein and the fibrinogens are evolutionarily related. 4. Intron sequences contain several examples of the A family of the artiodactyl Alu-like repeated sequences, together with a single example of a C-family sequence. The remainders of the introns of the kappa-casein gene, compared with the repeat elements and exons, are A + T-rich. 5. Among the lambda clones isolated, representatives were found of the A and B genetic variants which can be distinguished by restriction-enzyme analysis.

4395;23717658;Mapping and characterization of the interaction interface between two polypyrimidine-tract binding proteins and a nova-type protein of Solanum tuberosum.;Polypyrimidine tract-binding (PTB) proteins are RNA-binding proteins that generally contain four RNA recognition motifs (RRMs). In potato, six cDNAs encoding full-length PTB proteins have been identified. In the present study Nova1-like protein, designated StNova1, was identified as a potential interacting partner of the StPTB proteins via yeast two-hybrid screening. Nova protein is a RNA-binding protein that contains three K-homology (KH) domains. In humans, these proteins are involved in regulation of neuronal RNA metabolism but the role of Nova-like proteins in plants is poorly understood. We have validated this interaction and mapped the protein binding region on StNova1 and StPTB1 and -6 using a novel domain interaction phage display (DIPP) technique. The interaction between the two RNA-binding proteins StPTB1/6 and StNova1 is mediated through linker regions that are distinctly separated from the RRMs. Furthermore, using a random 21-mer phage-peptide library, we have identified a number of peptides with the consensus sequence motif [S/G][V/I][L/V]G that recognize the StPTB proteins. One over-represented peptide that recognizes StPTB6 contains the GVLGPWP sequence that is similar to the GIGGRYP sequence in the glycine-rich linker region between the KH2 and KH3 domains of StNova1. We show, through site-specific mutations, the importance of glycine and proline residues in StNova1-StPTB interactions. ;polyglycine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

By carbodiimide method, 16.9 mols of MTX could be coupled to one mol of IgG, but the antibody activity was completely lost. Whereas, 2.6-3.4 mols of MTX were bound to one mol of IgG and a quarter of original antibody activity was preserved by dextran bridge method. Choriocarcinoma cells BeWo and SCH were exposed to the IgG-MTX conjugates prepared by the latter method for 30 minutes, and the cell growth was investigated. To BeWo, which produces much hCG and less PLALP, anti hCG-IgG-MTX showed a considerable growth inhibition compared to the control groups (p less than 0.05). No effect was observed with anti PLALP-IgG-MTX, nonimmunized IgG-MTX, free MTX and anti hCG-IgG. In contrast, to SCH, which produces much PLALP and less hCG, anti PLALP-IgG-MTX exhibited considerable inhibition (p less than 0.05), whereas anti hCG-IgG-MTX showed no inhibition. Neither anti hCG-IgG-MTX nor anti PLALP-IgG-MTX showed any effect to the endometrial carcinoma cell HEC50B. We concluded that MTX bound to anti hCG-IgG and anti PLALP-IgG have specific growth inhibition effects to the choriocarcinoma cells in vitro, and suggested the possibility of specific immunochemotherapy of this disease.;-;-;-;hard_0
4402;21811785;Immunization with N-propionyl polysialic acid-KLH conjugate in patients with small cell lung cancer is safe and induces IgM antibodies reactive with SCLC cells and bactericidal against group B meningococci.;"Polysialic acid (polySA) is a polymer side chain bound to the neural cell adhesion molecule that is extensively expressed on the surface of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells. In our previous study, a robust antibody response was noted in patients with SCLC after vaccination with 30 μg of keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)-conjugated N-propionylated (NP-) polySA, but peripheral neuropathy and ataxia were detected in several vaccinated patients. The objectives of the current trial were to establish the lowest optimal dose and to confirm the safety of the induction of antibodies against polySA with the NP-polySA vaccine. Patients with SCLC who completed initial treatment and had no evidence of disease progression were injected with either 10 or 3 μg of NP-polySA conjugated to KLH and mixed with 100 μg of immunologic adjuvant (QS-21) at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 16. Nine patients were enrolled at each of the two dose levels. Prior to vaccination, one patient in each group had low-titer antibodies against polysialic acid. All patients at the 10 μg vaccine dose level responded to vaccination with IgM antibody titers against polysialic acid (median titer 1/1,280 by ELISA), and all but one patient made IgM and IgG antibodies against the artificial vaccine immunogen, NP-polysialic acid (median titer 1/10,240). The antibody responses at the 3 μg vaccine dose level were lower; six of nine patients developed antibodies against polysialic acid (median titer 1/160). Post-vaccination sera from 6/9 and 3/9 patients in the 10 and 3 μg groups reacted strongly with human SCLC cells by fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS). Sera from all patients in the 10 μg dose group also had bactericidal activity against group B meningococci with rabbit complement. Self-limited grade 3 ataxia of unclear etiology was seen in 1 of 18 patients. Vaccination with NP-polySA-KLH resulted in consistent high-titer antibody responses, with the 10 μg dose significantly more immunogenic than the 3 μg dose. This study establishes the lowest optimally immunogenic dose of NP-polysialic acid in this NP-polysialic acid-KLH conjugate vaccine to be at least 10 μg, and it establishes the vaccine's safety. We plan to incorporate NP-polySA into a polyvalent vaccine against SCLC with four glycolipid antigens also widely expressed in SCLC-GD2, GD3, fucosylated GM1, and globo H.

4409;20498830;Distamycin A inhibits HMGA1-binding to the P-selectin promoter and attenuates lung and liver inflammation during murine endotoxemia.;"The architectural transcription factor High Mobility Group-A1 (HMGA1) binds to the minor groove of AT-rich DNA and forms transcription factor complexes (""enhanceosomes"") that upregulate expression of select genes within the inflammatory cascade during critical illness syndromes such as acute lung injury (ALI). AT-rich regions of DNA surround transcription factor binding sites in genes critical for the inflammatory response. Minor groove binding drugs (MGBs), such as Distamycin A (Dist A), interfere with AT-rich region DNA binding in a sequence and conformation-specific manner, and HMGA1 is one of the few transcription factors whose binding is inhibited by MGBs. To determine whether MGBs exert beneficial effects during endotoxemia through attenuating tissue inflammation via interfering with HMGA1-DNA binding and modulating expression of adhesion molecules. Administration of Dist A significantly decreased lung and liver inflammation during murine endotoxemia. In intravital microscopy studies, Dist A attenuated neutrophil-endothelial interactions in vivo following an inflammatory stimulus. Endotoxin induction of P-selectin expression in lung and liver tissue and promoter activity in endothelial cells was significantly reduced by Dist A, while E-selectin induction was not significantly affected. Moreover, Dist A disrupted formation of an inducible complex containing NF-kappaB that binds an AT-rich region of the P-selectin promoter. Transfection studies demonstrated a critical role for HMGA1 in facilitating cytokine and NF-kappaB induction of P-selectin promoter activity, and Dist A inhibited binding of HMGA1 to this AT-rich region of the P-selectin promoter in vivo. We describe a novel targeted approach in modulating lung and liver inflammation in vivo during murine endotoxemia through decreasing binding of HMGA1 to a distinct AT-rich region of the P-selectin promoter. These studies highlight the ability of MGBs to function as molecular tools for dissecting transcriptional mechanisms in vivo and suggest alternative treatment approaches for critical illness.

4412;8917087;Construction of adenoviral and retroviral vectors coexpressing the genes encoding the hepatitis B surface antigen and B7-1 protein.;Recombinant retroviral (re-Rv) and adenoviral (re-Ad) vectors for delivery of two foreign genes were constructed, using the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) which mediates initiation of cap-independent translation. The first gene encoded the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and the second encoded human or murine B7-1 molecule, a cell surface protein which is a costimulator for T cell activation. The EMCV IRES sequence was placed between the first and second coding sequences to form a dicistronic DNA fragment. In Rv vectors, the dicistronic fragment was inserted between the 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) and an internal promoter for the neomycin (neo) gene, so that the transcription initiated from the 5' LTR would generate a dicistronic mRNA for the HBsAg and B7-1 molecules. For Ad vectors, the dicistronic fragment was inserted between a cytomegalovirus promoter and a polyA signal to form a transcription cassette. This transcription cassette was inserted into the early region 1 of Ad5 genome to form a replication-defective re-Ad vector, or into early region 3 to form replication-competent vectors. Human cell line A549 infected with the re-Rv vectors or with the re-Ad vectors synthesized and secreted HBsAg at comparable levels, while the B7-1 molecules were detected at the surface of the infected cells, indicating both foreign genes carried by the Rv and Ad vectors were expressed efficiently.; polyalanine ;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
4415;16799810;Differential TCR gene usage between WC1- and WC1+ ruminant gammadelta T cell subpopulations including those responding to bacterial antigen.;Ruminant gammadelta T cells are divided into subpopulations based on the presence or absence of WC1 co-receptors (scavenger-receptor-cysteine-rich family members uniquely expressed on gammadelta T cells). Evidence suggests WC1+ are inflammatory while WC1- are regulatory and that they also differ in their tissue distribution. Recently, this paradigm was refined further as cells that produce interferon-gamma and proliferate to autologous antigens, leptospira antigens, or IL-12 were largely found within the WC1+ subpopulation that bears the WC1.1 antigenic epitope but not that bearing the WC1.2 epitope. Here, the T cell receptor gene expression by these different subpopulations (WC1-, WC1.1+, and WC1.2+) was compared using flow cytometrically-purified cells and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The WC1- gammadelta T cells had transcripts for all 11 possible combinations of the TRG subgroup V and C genes while those in both WC1+ subpopulations were restricted to TRGV3-TRGC5 and TRGV7-TRGC5. In contrast, all three subpopulations expressed transcripts from all four known bovine TRDV genes. Further analysis of the WC1+ gammadelta T cells that proliferated in leptospira antigen-stimulated cultures indicated that they do not represent a unique subpopulation within the larger WC1+ population based on their TCR gene usage. Moreover, sequencing of 65 transcripts showed that their junctional regions were diverse as TRGJ5-1, TRGJ5-2, TRDJ1, and TRDJ3 were used, and CDR3s ranged from 9 to 24 amino acids. The restricted but shared gammadelta TCR gene usage for WC1.1+, WC1.2+, and WC1(+)-antigen-responsive cells leaves open the possibility that the WC1 co-receptor is an important determining element in the activation process and subsequent response. ;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
4416;7041960;Histone-dependent reconstitution and nucleosomal localization of a nonhistone chromosomal protein: the H2A-specific protease.;We have described earlier a chromatin-bound protease with unique specificity for histone H2A [Eickbush, T. H., Watson, D. K., & Moudrianakis, E. N. (1976) Cell (Cambridge, Mass.) 9, 785--792]. In the present study, we explore the nature of interactions that form and stabilize the enzyme-chromatin system by using the activity of the protease to monitor its binding to DNA and DNA-histone complexes. During salt extraction of chromatin, the protease is released at an ionic strength between that required for the extraction of the slightly lysine-rich histones (H2A and H2B) and the arginine-rich histones (H3 and H4). The reassociation of this nonhistone protein to DNA has an absolute requirement for the H3--H4 tetramer and is only enhanced by the H2A--H2B dimer in the presence of the tetramer. We believe that the binding of the enzyme onto DNA requires some histone-elicited compaction of the helix. We have also examined the distribution of this enzyme within the chromatin fiber by isolating pools of monomer nucleosomes from micrococcal nuclease digests of 0.6 M NaCl extracted chromatin and from reconstituted DNA-protein complexes. The H2A-protease is found with these monomer nucleosome pools, and no activity can be detected in the low molecular weight products released during the digestion. Thus, by virtue of its extraction characteristics from chromatin and its association with isolated nucleosomes, this nonhistone protein exhibits properties hitherto assigned only to the inner histones. ;polyarginine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
4420;25157763;Measles vaccine strains for virotherapy of non-small-cell lung carcinoma.;Oncolytic virus therapy is a promising therapy for numerous tumor types. Edmonston-strain measles virus (MV) has been tested in clinical trials for ovarian cancer, glioma, and myeloma. Therefore, the antitumor activity of MV against non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was assessed. Human NSCLC cells and immortalized lung epithelial cell lines, Beas2B, were infected with either MV-producing green fluorescent protein or MV-producing carcinoembryonic antigen. Cells were assessed for viability, induction of apoptosis by caspase and poly-ADP ribose polymerase cleavage, and for viral transgene production. The dependency of MV entry on CD46 and nectin-4 were determined using blocking antibodies. The role of host translational activity on viral replication was assessed by overexpression of eIF4E and translation inhibition. Antitumor activity was assessed by measuring treated NSCLC xenografts from flanks of nude mice. MV infection of NSCLC cells results in potent cell killing in most of the cell lines compared with immortalized Beas2B cells and induces apoptosis. MV infection was prevented by blocking of CD46, however independent of nectin-4 blockade. Tumor weights are diminished after intratumoral injections of MV-producing carcinoembryonic antigen in one of two cell lines and result in detectable viral transgene in serum of mice. These data indicate that MV is oncolytic for human NSCLC and this was independent of nectin-4 expression. Dysregulated protein translational machinery may play a role in determining tumor tropism in NSCLC. MV combined with gemcitabine could be explored further as chemovirotherapy for NSCLC. ;polyalanine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
4422;23077311;Induction of stress granule-like structures in vesicular stomatitis virus-infected cells.;Previous studies from our laboratory revealed that cellular poly(C) binding protein 2 (PCBP2) downregulates vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) gene expression. We show here that VSV infection induces the formation of granular structures in the cytoplasm containing cellular RNA-binding proteins, including PCBP2, T-cell-restricted intracellular antigen 1 (TIA1), and TIA1-related protein (TIAR). Depletion of TIA1 via small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), but not depletion of TIAR, results in enhanced VSV growth and gene expression. The VSV-induced granules appear to be similar to the stress granules (SGs) generated in cells triggered by heat shock or oxidative stress but do not contain some of the bona fide SG markers, such as eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) or eIF4A, or the processing body (PB) markers, such as mRNA-decapping enzyme 1A (DCP1a), and thus may not represent canonical SGs or PBs. Our results revealed that the VSV-induced granules, called SG-like structures here, contain the viral replicative proteins and RNAs. The formation and maintenance of the SG-like structures required viral replication and ongoing protein synthesis, but an intact cytoskeletal network was not necessary. These results suggest that cells respond to VSV infection by aggregating the antiviral proteins, such as PCBP2 and TIA1, to form SG-like structures. The functional significance of these SG-like structures in VSV-infected cells is currently under investigation. ;polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
4426;7539119;Introduction of a loss-of-function point mutation from the SH3 region of the Caenorhabditis elegans sem-5 gene activates the transforming ability of c-abl in vivo and abolishes binding of proline-rich ligands in vitro.;"We have introduced two loss-of-function point mutations from highly conserved regions of the src homology 3 (SH3) domains of the Caenorhabditis elegans sem-5 gene into the SH3 domain of the murine type IV c-abl tyrosine kinase proto-oncogene. One of the mutations, P131L, activated abl to transform fibroblasts while the other, G128R, did not. When combined with independent activating mutations in the c-abl kinase domain or NH2-terminus, the G128R mutation blocked transformation by the double mutant, suggesting that the G128R mutant was unable to transform cells for trivial reasons. The c-Abl G128R mutant, like wild type c-Abl protein, was localized to the nucleus and actin cytoskeleton and had normal tyrosine kinase activity in vitro, while the transforming c-Abl P131L protein was localized exclusively to the cytoplasm and exhibited decreased in vitro kinase activity. By real-time biospecific interaction analysis, the wild type Abl SH3 domain bound to two proteins containing proline-rich motifs with dissociation constants of 0.2 and 17 microM; the G128R mutant bound with 50-fold lower affinity, and no binding was detected by the P131L mutant. Both mutations completely abolished binding of the Abl SH3 domain to proline-rich target proteins in a filter-binding assay. These results suggest that the transforming activity of Abl is regulated in vivo by an inhibitor protein which associates with the SH3 domain via a proline-rich sequence.

4431;8617202;The Clk/Sty protein kinase phosphorylates SR splicing factors and regulates their intranuclear distribution.;Mammalian Clk/Sty is the prototype for a family of dual specificity kinases (termed LAMMER kinases) that have been conserved in evolution, but whose physiological substrates are unknown. In a yeast two-hybrid screen, the Clk/Sty kinase specifically interacted with RNA binding proteins, particularly members of the serine/arginine-rich (SR) family of splicing factors. Clk/Sty itself has an serine/arginine-rich non-catalytic N-terminal region which is important for its association with SR splicing factors. In vitro, Clk/Sty efficiently phosphorylated the SR family member ASF/SF2 on serine residues located within its serine/arginine-rich region (the RS domain). Tryptic phosphopeptide mapping demonstrated that the sites on ASF/SF2 phosphorylated in vitro overlap with those phosphorylated in vivo. Immunofluorescence studies showed that a catalytically inactive form of Clk/Sty co-localized with SR proteins in nuclear speckles. Overexpression of the active Clk/Sty kinase caused a redistribution of SR proteins within the nucleus. These results suggest that Clk/Sty kinase directly regulates the activity and compartmentalization of SR splicing factors.;polyarginine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
4434;9632804;Two domains unique to osteoblast-specific transcription factor Osf2/Cbfa1 contribute to its transactivation function and its inability to heterodimerize with Cbfbeta.;Osf2/Cbfa1, hereafter called Osf2, is a member of the Runt-related family of transcription factors that plays a critical role during osteoblast differentiation. Like all Runt-related proteins, it contains a runt domain, which is the DNA-binding domain, and a C-terminal proline-serine-threonine-rich (PST) domain thought to be the transcription activation domain. Additionally, Osf2 has two amino-terminal domains distinct from any other Runt-related protein. To understand the mechanisms of osteoblast gene regulation by Osf2, we performed an extensive structure-function analysis. After defining a short Myc-related nuclear localization signal, a deletion analysis revealed the existence of three transcription activation domains and one repression domain. AD1 (for activation domain 1) comprises the first 19 amino acids of the molecule, which form the first domain unique to Osf2, AD2 is formed by the glutamine-alanine (QA) domain, the second domain unique to Osf2, and AD3 is located in the N-terminal half of the PST domain and also contains sequences unique to Osf2. The transcription repression domain comprises the C-terminal 154 amino acids of Osf2. DNA-binding, domain-swapping, and protein interaction experiments demonstrated that full-length Osf2 does not interact with Cbfbeta, a known partner of Runt-related proteins, whereas a deletion mutant of Osf2 containing only the runt and PST domains does. The QA domain appears to be responsible for preventing this heterodimerization. Thus, our results uncover the unique functional organization of Osf2 by identifying functional domains not shared with other Runt-related proteins that largely control its transactivation and heterodimerization abilities. ;polythreonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

4438;30281021;Changes in mRNA abundance drive shuttling of RNA binding proteins, linking cytoplasmic RNA degradation to transcription.;Alterations in global mRNA decay broadly impact multiple stages of gene expression, although signals that connect these processes are incompletely defined. Here, we used tandem mass tag labeling coupled with mass spectrometry to reveal that changing the mRNA decay landscape, as frequently occurs during viral infection, results in subcellular redistribution of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in human cells. Accelerating Xrn1-dependent mRNA decay through expression of a gammaherpesviral endonuclease drove nuclear translocation of many RBPs, including poly(A) tail-associated proteins. Conversely, cells lacking Xrn1 exhibited changes in the localization or abundance of numerous factors linked to mRNA turnover. Using these data, we uncovered a new role for relocalized cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein in repressing recruitment of TATA binding protein and RNA polymerase II to promoters. Collectively, our results show that changes in cytoplasmic mRNA decay can directly impact protein localization, providing a mechanism to connect seemingly distal stages of gene expression. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
4441;2446298;The major 40-kDa glycoprotein in human prostatic fluid is identical to Zn-alpha 2-glycoprotein.;A major 40-KDA protein secreted by human prostate was isolated from whole seminal plasma by sequential column chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B, concanavalin A(Con A)-Sepharose, and Sephadex G-100. Although the purified preparation still contained minor contaminants, its amino acid composition was found to be identical to the one of a glycoprotein isolated previously from seminal plasma by Lin et al (1983). Antibodies against this protein were produced in rabbits and their use in immunoblotting experiments revealed the presence of the antigen in several tissues including the prostate, the liver, the heart, the kidney, the epididymis, and the testis. A radioimmunoassay confirmed these results and showed that blood serum concentrations of this protein were relatively high in men (81 +/- 3 micrograms/ml), women (68 +/- 3 micrograms/ml), and cord blood of newborns (32 +/- 1 micrograms/ml). The serum concentrations of this protein along with its physicochemical characteristics suggested that it could be identical to Zn-alpha 2-glycoprotein, a human serum protein previously isolated by Burgi and Schmid (1961). This hypothesis was confirmed by a double immunodiffusion analysis using a commercial anti-Zn-alpha 2-glycoprotein antiserum. Finally, in vitro translation of prostatic poly(A) + RNA in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes resulted in the formation of an immunoprecipitable 42-kDa band. These results show that Zn-alpha 2-glycoprotein can be synthesized in the prostate itself. The demonstration of high concentrations of this protein in prostatic tissue and prostatic secretion should facilitate the elucidation of its role in the prostate and in other tissues.; polyalanine ;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

4446;3006062;DNA binding site for a factor(s) required to initiate simian virus 40 DNA replication.;Efficient initiation of DNA replication in the absence of nonspecific DNA repair synthesis was obtained by using a modification of the system developed by J.J. Li and T.J. Kelly [(1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81, 6973-6977]. Circular double-stranded DNA plasmids replicated in extracts of CV-1 cells only when the plasmids contained the cis-acting origin sequence for simian virus 40 DNA replication (ori) and the extract contained simian virus 40 large tumor antigen. Competition between plasmids containing ori and plasmids carrying deletions in and about ori served to identify a sequence that binds the rate-limiting factor(s) required to initiate DNA replication. The minimum binding site (nucleotides 72-5243) encompassed one-half of the simian virus 40 ori sequence that is required for initiation of replication (ori-core) plus the contiguous sequence on the late gene side of ori-core containing G + C-rich repeats that facilitates initiation (ori-auxiliary). This initiation factor binding site was specific for the simian virus 40 ori region, even though it excluded the high-affinity large tumor antigen DNA binding sites.;polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
4449;1339391;The HRAS1 gene cluster: two upstream regions recognizing transcripts and a third encoding a gene with a leucine zipper domain.;We have cloned and characterized a 55-kb region of DNA surrounding HRAS1. It contains a cluster of two, and possibly three, genes associated with CpG islands within the 32 kb immediately upstream of HRAS1. We have sequenced cDNAs representing one of these genes, provisionally designated HRC1. The locus, which is located 29 kb upstream of HRAS1, is divergently transcribed. HRC1 cDNA probe recognizes fragments on Southern blots of DNA from other vertebrate species. In human DNA, multiple homologous fragments are detected in addition to the predicted ones containing HRC1. Therefore, this locus may represent a member of an evolutionarily conserved gene family. HRC1 expression is upregulated with HRAS1 in the EJ bladder carcinoma cell line, suggesting the possibility of coordinate regulation. The deduced translational product of the longest open reading frame (1119 nucleotides, 373 amino acids) predicts a protein with regions rich in glutamine and proline and a region similar to the helix-loop-helix motif adjacent to a carboxy-terminal leucine zipper dimerization motif with four heptad repeats. Alternate splicing of terminal exons occurs, resulting in the truncation of one proline-rich domain and preservation of the leucine zipper. Thus, a biologically important region of chromosome 11p consists of a gene cluster. At least one of these genes, in addition to HRAS1, may be involved in regulation of cell growth or differentiation.;polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function

4451;6686812;Platelet aggregability in smoking and non-smoking subjects.;The hypothesis was investigated that the arachidonic acid (AA) system has a different impact on platelet function in smoking compared to non-smoking subjects. Arterial blood was sampled from smokers and non-smokers, and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was prepared. There were no differences in sex and age distribution between the groups. One portion of the PRP was used to determine the lowest amount of AA required to induce platelet aggregation. In other portions the endogenous anti-aggregatory (prostacyclin/PGI2/-like) activity in the blood was determined, after reinforcing it with theophylline. There was no difference between smokers and non-smokers regarding the amount of AA required to induce platelet aggregation. In fresh PRP prepared from blood from non-smoking subjects theophylline (10(-4) M) induced a 12-17% inhibition of the ADP-induced aggregation of platelets, indicating the presence of endogenous subthreshold concentrations of PGI2-like activity in their blood. The corresponding inhibition in fresh PRP prepared from blood from smokers was significantly lower (4-7%), suggesting lower endogenous concentrations of PGI2-like activity in their blood, or alternatively, decreased platelet sensitivity to the action of such activity. From these data we conclude that smokers differ from non-smokers with regard to their platelet function: platelet aggregability in response to AA is unaffected, while the endogenous anti-aggregatory power in the plasma is decreased. These observations may be of significance for the cardiovascular hazards connected with smoking.;-;-;-;hard_0
4452;7799955;Nucleolin is a matrix attachment region DNA-binding protein that specifically recognizes a region with high base-unpairing potential.;A DNA affinity column containing a synthetic double-stranded nuclear matrix attachment region (MAR) was used to purify a 100-kDa protein from human erythroleukemia K562 cells. This protein was identified as nucleolin, the key nucleolar protein of dividing cells, which is thought to control rRNA gene transcription and ribosome assembly. Nucleolin is known to bind RNA and single-stranded DNA. We report here that nucleolin is also a MAR-binding protein. It binds double-stranded MARs from different species with high affinity. Nucleolin effectively distinguishes between a double-stranded wild-type synthetic MAR sequence with a high base-unpairing potential and its mutated version that has lost the unpairing capability but is still A+T rich. Thus, nucleolin is not merely an A+T-rich sequence-binding protein but specifically binds the base-unpairing region of MARs. This binding specificity is similar to that of the previously cloned tissue-specific MAR-binding protein SATB1. Unlike SATB1, which binds only double-stranded MARs, nucleolin binds the single-stranded T-rich strand of the synthetic MAR probe approximately 45-fold more efficiently than its complementary A-rich strand, which has an affinity comparable to that of the double-stranded form of the MAR. In contrast to the high selectivity of binding to double-stranded MARs, nucleolin shows only a small but distinct sequence preference for the T-rich strand of the wild-type synthetic MAR over the T-rich strand of its mutated version. The affinity to the T-rich synthetic MAR is severalfold higher than to its corresponding RNA and human telomere DNA. Quantitative cellular fractionation and extraction experiments indicate that nucleolin is present both as a soluble protein and tightly bound to the matrix, similar to other known MAR-binding proteins. ;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Theoretical calculations were carried out to locate the most energetically favorable chemical substituent group relative to a core skeleton group on interaction with the FKBP binding cavity. Connolly accessible surface calculations have complemented the molecular mechanics and dynamics approaches. Calculated results were also analyzed on the basis of hydrogen bond interactions, relative energies of interaction, root-mean square deviations of amino acid residues of the crystallized protein, and orientation of the substituent groups within the active site.

4455;3379636;Structural organization of the mouse aspartate aminotransferase isoenzyme genes. Introns antedate the divergence of cytosolic and mitochondrial isoenzyme genes.;We have cloned and characterized a mouse cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT) (EC 2.6.1.1) gene, which is about 32,000 base-pairs long and is interrupted by eight introns. The 5' and 3'-flanking regions, and the exact sizes and boundaries of the exon blocks, including the transcription-initiation sites, were determined. The 5' end of the gene lacks the TATA and CAAT boxes characteristic of eukaryotic promoters, but contains G + C-rich sequences, three putative binding sites for a cellular transcription factor, Sp1, and multiple transcription-initiation sites. The sequences around the transcription-initiation sites are compatible with the formation of a number of potentially stable stem-loop structures. We compared the structural organization of the mouse cytosolic AspAT gene with that of the mouse mitochondrial AspAT gene, which has nine introns. We found that the promoter regions share a high level of homology and five of the introns are at identical places. This close matching leads to the tentative conclusion that the introns were in place before the divergence of cytosolic and mitochondrial isoenzyme genes.;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
4457;9383466;Receptor-targeted co-transport of DNA and magnetic resonance contrast agents.;"BACKGROUND
Ligand molecules conjugated to polylysine can be electrostatically bound to DNA and can bind receptors or antigens on the surface of cells, delivering the DNA into specific cells and tissues. Several researchers have used this approach to generate non-viral vehicles for the efficient delivery of DNA to specific cells. We have attempted to adopt this general approach to the cell-specific delivery of magnetic contrast agents for use in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).


RESULTS
We have synthesized a new class of agents capable of both transfecting genes into cells and enhancing the contrast of the targeted cells for MRI. DNA is used both to encode a marker gene and as a molecular scaffold, which electrostatically binds polylysine conjugated to transferrin, an iron uptake protein, and polylysine modified with gadolinium chelated to diethylenetriaminepetaacetic acid. When cells displaying the transferrin receptor are treated with these particles, high levels of gene expression are observed, higher than with control particles composed only of transferrin, polylysine and DNA. The treated cells show specific MRI contrast enhancement, which did not require expression of the marker gene.


CONCLUSIONS
The development of this class of particles permits the use of novel protocols by which genes for genetic therapy and agents for MRI contrast are co-transported. These protocols may allow non-invasive MRI monitoring of DNA delivery for gene therapy in real time.";polylysine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

Comparison of the human gene with the previously described hamster gene revealed a high level of conservation in both the structural and regulatory regions of the genes. Each is composed of four exons with intron/exon junctions maintained at the identical positions. The human Gadd153 protein shares 91% identity with the hamster protein in amino acid sequence, and 78% identity in nucleotide sequence. A 900-bp fragment of 5' flanking sequence from the human gene, when linked to the bacterial cat reporter gene, was found to exhibit promoter activity in HeLa cells which could be further activated by treatment with the DNA alkylating agent, methyl methanesulfonate. Sequence analysis indicated that the human promoter region is relatively G+C-rich and contains putative binding sites for multiple transcription factors, including recognition sites for TATA- and CAAT-binding proteins, six Sp1-binding sites, an activator protein-1 binding site, an E-26-specific sequence-binding protein-1 DNA-binding site, and four interleukin-6 response elements.

4469;9478192;Structural determination in AUF1 required for high affinity binding to A + U-rich elements.;AUF1 is a RNA-binding protein that contains two non-identical RNA recognition motifs (RRMs). AUF1 binds to A + U-rich elements (AREs) with high affinity. The binding of AUF1 to AREs is believed to serve as a signal to a mRNA processing pathway which degrades mRNAs encoding many cytokines, oncoproteins and G protein-coupled receptors. Because the ARE-binding activity of AUF1 appears central to the regulation of many important genes, we analyzed the domains of the protein that are important for this activity. Examination of the binding affinity of various mutants indicates that both RRMs may be required for binding. However, they are not sufficient. Highest affinity binding requires an alanine/glycine-rich region of the N-terminus and a short glutamine-rich region in the C-terminus. The N-terminus is required for dimerization of AUF1. However, AUF1 binds an ARE as a hexameric protein. Thus protein-protein interactions are important for high affinity ARE-binding activity of AUF1. ;polyglutamine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

The data indicate that a protein, with an apparent molecular weight of 80 kDa, interacts specifically with pre-mRNA at the (UA)3efficiency element. Although the interaction is specific, it can be competed by RNA sequences that do not contain the same type of efficiency element; that is, a sequence lacking a (UA)3repeat.

OsMT1a, encoding a type 1 metallothionein, was isolated via suppression subtractive hybridization from Brazilian upland rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Iapar 9). Expression analysis revealed that OsMT1a predominantly expressed in the roots, and was induced by dehydration. Interestingly, the OsMT1a expression was also induced specifically by Zn(2+) treatment. Both transgenic plants and yeasts harboring OsMT1a accumulated more Zn(2+) than wild type controls, suggesting OsMT1a is most likely to be involved in zinc homeostasis. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsMT1a demonstrated enhanced tolerance to drought. The examination of antioxidant enzyme activities demonstrated that catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) were significantly elevated in transgenic plants. Furthermore, the transcripts of several Zn(2+)-induced CCCH zinc finger transcription factors accumulated in OsMT1a transgenic plants, suggesting that OsMT1a not only participates directly in ROS scavenging pathway but also regulates expression of the zinc finger transcription factors via the alteration of Zn(2+) homeostasis, which leads to improved plant stress tolerance. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

Murine monoclonal antibodies 2C10 (IgG2b) and 1A2 (IgG2a), which are known to react specifically with double-stranded (ds) DNA, dissociated completely from their complexes with DNA when washed with a neutral 0.5 M NaCl solution. Another monoclonal antibody (MoAb) (IgM,kappa), polyreactive with single-stranded (ss) DNA, cardiolipin, and trinitrophenylhapten (TNP), was also dissociated from its complexes with ss DNA, but not from its complexes with TNP, by 0.3-0.5 M NaCl. Similar differences were observed in the binding stability of serum antibodies from autoimmune mice to DNA and TNP. In contrast, anti-nucleic acid polyclonal antibodies induced in rabbits by immunization with poly(I), poly(dT) or poly(ADP-ribose) were not significantly dissociated from their immune complexes with relevant antigens or DNA by 0.5 M NaCl. The finding that nucleic acid antigens were not detached from a solid phase by washing with 0.5 M NaCl solution indicated that the reduction of binding of anti-DNA antibodies in both MoAbs and naturally occurring antibodies was really due to dissociation of the antibodies from immune complexes. This is the first demonstration that DNA epitopes recognized by naturally occurring antibodies in both SLE and its mouse models are sensitive to neutral NaCl concentrations. This novel trait of naturally occurring antibodies will be very useful in studies on the nature of immune complexes in sera and kidneys of cases of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).;polyisoleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

Rayleigh scattering of Mossbauer radiation data].;Classical model system: Poly-L-glutamic acid (Poly-Glu) was investigated in a disordered coil state (at pH-7.0) and in helix state (at pH 2.0) by Rayleigh scattering of Moessbauer radiation technique. Consider that the coil state of poly-Glu models unfolded (random coil) state and alpha-helix state models the fluctuating secondary structure (during consequent folding of protein) comparative analysis of dynamical properties of poly-Glu in different states with dynamical properties of different proteins in native state (alpha-helical myoglobin and HSA, partially beta-sheet lysozyme) and in intermediate (molten globule) state (alpha-lactalbumin) was performed. This comparison bring some surprising results: native alpha-helical proteins behave itself close to random coil, native partially beta-sheet protein behaves close to fluctuating secondary structure (alpha-helix) and the dynamic behaviour of molten globule state (partially beta-sheet alpha-lactalbumin) is not different from those behaviour of lysozyme and much more rigid than native alpha-helical proteins. As a result one cannot exclude the possibility that folding process and dynamical properties at different steps of the folding are very different for alpha-helical and beta-sheet proteins.;polyglutamine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
4483;22952710;Screening for novel LRRK2 inhibitors using a high-throughput TR-FRET cellular assay for LRRK2 Ser935 phosphorylation.;Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase-2 (LRRK2) have been linked to Parkinson's disease. Recent studies show that inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity decreased the level of phosphorylation at its own Ser910 and Ser935, indicating that these sites are prime targets for cellular readouts of LRRK2 inhibition. Using Time-Resolved Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) technology, we developed a high-throughput cellular assay for monitoring LRRK2 phosphorylation at Ser935. LRRK2-Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP) fusions were expressed in cells via BacMam. Phosphorylation at Ser935 in these cells is detected using a terbium labeled anti-phospho-Ser935 antibody that generates a TR-FRET signal between terbium and GFP. LRRK2 wild-type and G2019S are constitutively phosphorylated at Ser935 in cells as measured by TR-FRET. The phosphorylation level is reduced for the R1441C mutant and little could be detected for the kinase-dead mutant D1994A. The TR-FRET cellular assay was further validated using reported LRRK2 inhibitors including LRRK2-IN-1 and our results confirmed that inhibition of LRRK2 can reduce the phosphorylation level at Ser935. To demonstrate the utility of this assay for screening, we profiled a small library of 1120 compounds. Three known LRRK2 inhibitors were identified and 16 hits were followed up in the TR-FRET and a cytotoxicity assay. Interestingly, out of the top 16 hits, five are known inhibitors of IκB phosphorylation, two CHK1 and two CDC25 inhibitors. Thirteen hits were further tested in a biochemical LRRK2 kinase activity assay and Western blot analysis for their effects on the phosphorylation of Ser910, Ser935, Ser955 and Ser973. We developed a TR-FRET cellular assay for LRRK2 Ser935 phosphorylation that can be applied to the screening for LRRK2 inhibitors. We report for the first time that several compounds such as IKK16, CHK1 inhibitors and GW441756 can inhibit LRRK2 Ser935 phosphorylation in cells and LRRK2 kinase activity in vitro. ;polyleucine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
4484;7069544;Physiologic implications of two different heat shields for infants under radiant warmers.;To study the effects of two different heat shields commonly used under radiant warmers (thin plastic blanket vs a plastic body hood) on premature newborn infants, eight neonates were studied to measure insensible water loss and radiant power density at the skin under control and two shielded conditions. The body hood was found to diminish transmission of radiant heat to the infant's skin by 80%, absorbing heat and becoming warm (P less than 0.001). The plastic blanket absorbed only 15% of radiant warmer heat output (P less than 0.01). Insensible water loss was significantly less under the plastic blanket (1.88 +/- 0.4) ml/kg/hour) than under control (2.70 +/- 0.50 ml/kg/hour, P less than 0.01) and hood (2.86 +/- 0.32 ml/kg/hour, P less than 0.05) conditions. There was no decrease in insensible water loss under the hood compared to controls. This study demonstrates that a thin plastic blanket is the more effective shield against insensible water loss under a radiant warmer. Caution should be exercised with any shielding device to prevent interference with radiant heat delivery.;-;-;-;hard_0

4489;8389660;Malignant fibrous histiocytoma in childhood.;"BACKGROUND
Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) is a neoplasm of late adult life and often is reported in the pediatric population. It is thought to behave more benignly in children than in adults.


METHOD
Clinical and pathologic features, treatment, and outcome of nine pediatric patients seen at British Columbia's Children's Hospital between 1983 and 1990 were examined. The literature regarding pediatric malignant fibrous histiocytoma was reviewed.


RESULTS
The tumors included one primary renal tumor and two occurring in the orbit after radiation therapy for retinoblastoma during the neonatal period. Histologic examination showed that six tumors had a storiform-pleomorphic pattern, one was myxoid, and two were angiomatoid in type. Six children are alive with a disease-free survival of 20 months to 8 years after surgical resection. Two of these received adjuvant chemotherapy, none had radiation therapy. Three patients have died of disease, two with pulmonary metastases that developed despite multiagent chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Poor outcome was associated with large tumors, deep and proximal location, and the storiform-pleomorphic histologic type with atypical mitoses.


CONCLUSION
Malignant fibrous histiocytoma is similar in children and adults. Surgery is the mainstay of therapy, but the risk of local recurrence and pulmonary metastases indicates the need for adjuvant therapy in selected patients.";-;-;-;hard_0
4490;8770913;Testosterone regulates tissue-specific changes in the binding of a 47-kilodalton protein to a highly conserved sequence in the 3' untranslated region of epidermal growth factor messenger ribonucleic acid.;Epidermal growth factor (EGF) transcripts that use the terminal polyadenylation signal display a dramatic sex difference in the pattern of polyadenylation in the murine submaxillary gland (SMG), whereas those in the kidney do not. It takes 3 days before testosterone treatment begins to change the polyadenylation pattern in female SMG to resemble the male pattern, a finding that supports previous suggestions that posttranscriptional mechanisms are involved in regulating EGF expression. The conservation of a unique 23-b sequence centered on the terminal polyadenylation signal in all published mammalian EGF sequences suggested that trans-acting factors involved in EGF messenger RNA (mRNA) metabolism might bind to this sequence. To investigate this, we prepared 32P-RNA containing the 3' terminal EGF 23-b sequence plus a short poly-A tail, and incubated it with SMG cytosol. Cytosol retarded the electrophoretic mobility of this RNA as a single prominent band on 8% PAGE, and by UV-cross-linking, a single prominent 47-kDa protein was detected on 10% SDS-PAGE. Trypsin abolished both the gel-retarding and cross-linking activities. Cytosol from female SMGs contained approximately 8 times more of both the RNA binding activities than male cytosol. Injecting testosterone (200 microg QOD) into female mice altered both the RNA binding activities in a biphasic fashion, initially increasing them by about 40% at 2 days, then decreasing them by about 65% > or = 5 days, reaching male levels. Kidney cytosol contained both RNA binding activities but displayed neither sexual dimorphism nor testosterone-responsiveness. The tissue-specific testosterone-dependent changes observed in the 47-kDa protein occur before the increase in EGF mRNA levels and before the change in EGF mRNA polyad-enylation, so this cytosolic protein could be a trans-acting factor involved in EGF polyadenylation. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

A clinical and molecular characterization of a patient with BPES type I was performed. We present a 16-year-old adolescent girl with surgically treated blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus that was associated with delayed puberty and secondary amenorrhea at the age of 15, indicators that suggested that the patient had BPES type I. The FOXL2 gene was analyzed by sequencing its coding region. The sequence analysis of the FOXL2 gene revealed a novel heterozygous mutation: an 11 bp duplication (c.901_911dup11) that was predicted to encode a truncated protein (p.Pro305Argfs*54). A novel out-of-frame duplication following the polyalanine domain in the FOXL2 gene was identified in a Chilean patient with BPES type I.

4499;22216210;Bifunctional anti-huntingtin proteasome-directed intrabodies mediate efficient degradation of mutant huntingtin exon 1 protein fragments.;"Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a trinucleotide (CAG)(n) repeat expansion in the coding sequence of the huntingtin gene, and an expanded polyglutamine (>37Q) tract in the protein. This results in misfolding and accumulation of huntingtin protein (htt), formation of neuronal intranuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions, and neuronal dysfunction/degeneration. Single-chain Fv antibodies (scFvs), expressed as intrabodies that bind htt and prevent aggregation, show promise as immunotherapeutics for HD. Intrastriatal delivery of anti-N-terminal htt scFv-C4 using an adeno-associated virus vector (AAV2/1) significantly reduces the size and number of aggregates in HDR6/1 transgenic mice; however, this protective effect diminishes with age and time after injection. We therefore explored enhancing intrabody efficacy via fusions to heterologous functional domains. Proteins containing a PEST motif are often targeted for proteasomal degradation and generally have a short half life. In ST14A cells, fusion of the C-terminal PEST region of mouse ornithine decarboxylase (mODC) to scFv-C4 reduces htt exon 1 protein fragments with 72 glutamine repeats (httex1-72Q) by ~80-90% when compared to scFv-C4 alone. Proteasomal targeting was verified by either scrambling the mODC-PEST motif, or via proteasomal inhibition with epoxomicin. For these constructs, the proteasomal degradation of the scFv intrabody proteins themselves was reduced<25% by the addition of the mODC-PEST motif, with or without antigens. The remaining intrabody levels were amply sufficient to target N-terminal httex1-72Q protein fragment turnover. Critically, scFv-C4-PEST prevents aggregation and toxicity of httex1-72Q fragments at significantly lower doses than scFv-C4. Fusion of the mODC-PEST motif to intrabodies is a valuable general approach to specifically target toxic antigens to the proteasome for degradation. ";polyglutamine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
4503;1438298;Molecular cloning and primary structure of the human blood group RhD polypeptide.;The RH (rhesus) blood group locus from RhD-positive donors is composed of two homologous structural genes, one of which encodes the Cc and Ee polypeptides, whereas the other, which is missing in the RhD-negative condition, encodes the D protein that carries the major antigen of the RH system. Recently, different splicing isoforms transcribed from the CcEe gene were isolated. We report now the characterization of two other Rh clones, RhII and RhXIII, generated by alternative choices for poly(A) addition sites that were identified as the RhD gene transcripts. That these cDNAs represented the RhD messenger and that the previously described Rh clones were derived from the CcEe gene was demonstrated by amplification of RhII/XIII sequences only from D-positive genomes and by cloning and sequencing of D- and CcEe-specific gene fragments. The predicted translation product of the RhD mRNA is a 417-amino acid protein (M(r) = 45,500) that exhibited a similar membrane organization with 13 bilayer-spanning domains compared with the polypeptide encoded by the CcEe gene. The D and Cc/Ee polypeptides differ by 36 amino acid substitutions (8.4% divergence), but the NH2- and COOH-terminal regions of the two proteins are well conserved. Similarly, five of the six cysteine residues of the Cc/Ee proteins were conserved in the D protein, including the unique exofacial cysteine, which is critical for antigenic reactivity. The sequence homology between the Cc/Ee and D proteins supports the concept that the genes encoding these polypeptides have evolved by duplication of a common ancestor gene.; polyalanine ;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

Here, we report the roles of the circRNA AFF4/miR-7223-5p/PIK3R1 axis during fracture healing. We found that increased expression of PIK3R1 during fracture healing is directly associated with augmented proliferation and decreased apoptosis of MC3T3-E1 cells. Furthermore, miR-7223-5p targeted PI3KR1 and inhibited MC3T3-E1 proliferation while promoting apoptosis. CircRNA AFF4 acted as a sponge of miR-7223-5p, thereby promoting MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. Local injection of circRNA AFF4 into femoral fracture sites promoted fracture healing in vivo while the injection of miR-7223-5p delayed healing. These findings suggest that CircRNA AFF4 promotes fracture healing by targeting the miR-7223-5p/PIK3R1 axis, and suggests miR-7223-5p, CircRNA AFF4, and the miR-7223-5p/PIK3R1 axis are potential therapeutic targets for improving fracture healing.;-;-;-;hard_0

Most resting B cells do not express Bright; however, it is induced after stimulation with antigen or polyclonal mitogens. Bright activation results in up-regulation of mu transcription; however, it is not clear whether Bright function is critical for normal B cell development. To begin to address Bright function during B cell development, seven mutated forms of Bright were produced. Five of the seven mutants revealed little or no DNA binding activity. Furthermore, because Bright binds DNA as a dimer, two of the mutants formed complexes with wild type Bright and acted in a dominant negative fashion. Dominant negative Bright prevented the up-regulation of mu transcription in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with wild type Bright. These data identify regions within Bright that are required for the DNA binding activity of Bright and for its function as a transcription factor.

A preliminary ternary crystal structure of a novel compound was successfully solved. Upon analysis of this initial complex, further structural elaborations were made, and a series of active 5-(arylthio)quinazolinones was developed. The synthetic strategy was based on the displacement of a halogen at the 5-position of a quinazolinone by various aryl thioanions.

The present study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of arteether on acute chloroquine resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria in eastern coalfield area of Asansol. A total of 30 patients with chloroquine resistant falciparum malaria smear and histidine-rich protein II (HRPII) antigen positive were given arteether intramuscularly in a single daily dose of 150 mg (3 mg/kg body weight in case of children) for three consecutive days.

4514;9355129;Antigenic variation in Giardia lamblia and the host's immune response.;Giardia lamblia, a protozoan parasite of the small intestine of humans and other animals, undergoes surface antigenic variation. The antigens involved belong to a family of variant-specific surface proteins (VSPs), which are unique, cysteine-rich zinc finger proteins. The patterns of infection in humans and animals fail to show the expected cyclical waves of increasing and decreasing numbers of parasites expressing unique VSPs. Nevertheless, changes in VSP expression occur within the population in vivo owing to selection of VSPs by both immune and non-immune mechanisms. After inoculation of a single G. lamblia clone (able to persist in the absence of immune pressure) expressing one VSP (> or = 90%) into mice or humans, the original VSP continues to be expressed until 2 weeks post inoculation (p.i.), when many other VSPs gradually replace it. Selection by immune-mediated processes is suggested because switching occurs at the same time that humoral responses are first detected. In most mouse strains, switching also occurs at about two weeks. Almost all trophozoites are eliminated at three weeks (p.i.), but a barely detectable infection persists over months. In neonatal mice, apparent self-cure is delayed until the sixth or seventh week. Antigenic switching does not occur in adult or neonatal severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) mice, but does occur in neonatal nude mice, thus implicating B-cell-mediated mechanisms in immune switching. Not all VSPs are expressed to the same degree in vivo. Some VSPs appear to be preferentially selected whereas others are eliminated on a non-immune basis. In infections in which immunity does not play a role, such as in SCID mice, and during the first week of infection in immunocompetent mice or gerbils, persisting VSPs are preferentially expressed and maintained whereas non-persisting VSPs are replaced within the first week of infection. The purpose of antigenic variation may be presentation of a wide assortment of VSPs to hosts, increasing the chance of a successful initial infection or reinfection. Immune selection of variants comes into play following biological selection.;polycysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
4515;6180053;Interferon-mediated antiviral state in human MRC5 cells in the absence of detectable levels of 2-5A synthetase and protein kinase.;Treatment of human HeLa and MRC5 cells with human alpha (leukocyte) and beta (fibroblast) interferon results in the development of an antiviral state against two types of viruses: vesicular stomatitis virus (rhabdovirus) and encephalomyocarditis virus (picornavirus). These cells, however, differ in their ability to synthesize the two double-stranded (ds) RNA-dependent enzymatic activities, pppA(2'p5'A)n synthetase (2-5A synthetase) and protein kinase which have been reported to be induced in several cell lines by interferon. Both the 2-5A synthetase and the protein kinase are enhanced by several fold in HeLa cells on treatment with interferon. In contrast, neither the 2-5A synthetase nor the protein kinase can be detected in MRC5 cell treated or not treated with interferon. The lack of detection of the 2-5A synthetase in MRC5 cells is not associated with the absence of the other components of the 2-5A system (2-5A dependent nuclease and 2'-phosphodiesterase). We have previously shown that MRC5 cells are sensitive to the action of 2-5A and furthermore the inhibitory action of 2-5A on these cells is transient. Mixing experiments between HeLa and MRC5 cell fractions after partial purification on columns of poly(I).poly(C)-Sepharose, showed that the absence of detection of the protein kinase activity in MRC5 cells cannot be attributed to the presence of phosphatases or other inhibitors of phosphorylation in control or interferon-treated MRC5 cell extracts. In addition, we show that the interferon-mediated protein kinase activity in HeLa cell extracts can be precipitated by treatment at pH 5, a procedure which leads to an enhanced level of detectable protein kinase activity in general. Once again, however, MRC5 cell extracts fail to show any interferon-mediated protein kinase activity. These results suggest that either the two enzyme activities are not necessary for the development of the antiviral response induced by interferon or the intracellular events leading to the establishment of the antiviral state vary from one cell system to the other.;polycysteine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function

We previously showed that retroviral transduction of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) induces focally hyperplastic lesions resembling benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and an increase in the number of ganglion-like cells in the mouse prostate reconstitution (MPR) model in vivo. In the present study we further characterize the neuronal phenotypes induced by TGF-beta 1 retroviral transduction in MPRs.


METHODS
Computer-assisted morphometric analysis was used to evaluate neuronal density. Neuronal cell markers, including neurofilament, neuron-specific enolase, tyrosine hydroxylase, choline acetyltransferase, L-met enkaphaline, and serotonin, were detected by immunostaining.


RESULTS
A fourfold increase in neuronal density was observed in TGF-beta 1 retrovirus-transduced MPRs. The relative frequencies of neuronal subtypes remained similar, with catecholaminergic and cholinergic neurons presenting as the most abundant. We found no evidence of infection of neurons; therefore, increased neuronal density was likely due to paracrine activities.

4524;9768540;Role of hippocampus in alcohol-induced memory impairment: implications from behavioral and immediate early gene studies.;Acute alcohol intoxication disrupts memory acquisition in humans and laboratory animals. This review summarizes recent behavioral and immediate early gene expression studies addressing the mechanisms of this phenomenon. Most behavioral investigations agree that the amnestic effect of alcohol is due to its preferential detrimental effect on hippocampus-dependent than on hippocampus-independent forms of learning. However, some hippocampal lesion studies contradict these results. Learning in behavioral paradigms is accompanied by induction of c-fos and other immediate early genes in many brain regions of the animal. In contrast, studies on alcohol-mediated changes in expression of this gene confirm selective hippocampal suppression of basal and experience-induced expression of c-fos after acute and repeated administration of alcohol. This hippocampal suppression is in marked contrast with alcohol-mediated induction of c-fos expression in other brain areas. However, the selective suppression of hippocampal gene expression and memory by alcohol is most likely mediated by a number of interacting neurotransmitter systems. Thus, effects of lower doses of alcohol (0.5 g/kg or lower in rats) seem to be preferentially mediated through GABAergic systems. At intermediate doses (0.75-2 g/kg), several other neurotransmitter systems are affected besides GABA. Higher doses lead to none-specific effects, probably involving even more neurotransmitter systems. Elucidation of these neurotransmitter systems will be highly important for developing rational approaches for correction of alcohol-related cognitive disorders.;-;-;-;hard_0

The worldwide epidemic of obesity in adults has been mirrored in children in developed and developing countries. 2. Central obesity appears to be driving a cluster of abnormalities often referred to as the metabolic syndrome. 3. The definition of the metabolic syndrome in children is not suited to arbitrary cut-offs and a definition using the significant clustering of risk factors that is already evident in childhood and adolescent populations may be preferable. 4. An Australian population study showed that 25% of 8-year-olds and 29% of 14-year-olds could be described by the high risk cluster with features similar to adult metabolic syndrome. 5. The high risk cluster was significantly linked to high and low birthweight, shorter duration of breast-feeding, larger postnatal weight gains after 12 months of age and raised C-reactive protein, gamma glutamyl transferase and alanine transaminase levels. At-risk young adults have also been shown to have macroscopic atherosclerosis in post-mortem studies. 6. Identification of at-risk children has obvious benefits for the individual and as well, for prevention of a future cohort with raised cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; however, complexities and controversies exist in doing so. Familial, genetic and lifestyle risk factors aggregate and labelling children with predisease may be problematic.

4526;8756478;The release of the variant surface protein of Giardia to its soluble isoform is mediated by the selective cleavage of the conserved carboxy-terminal domain.;The trophozoites of Giardia duodenalis are covered by a coat composed of an apparently single species of a group of novel, cysteine-rich proteins. These variant-specific surface proteins (VSPs) can be changed by sequential expression of different VSP genes, a process for which a gradual exchange of VSP molecules appears to be required. In the present study, we have examined the in vitro release of one of these VSPs (VSP4A1, formerly named CRISP-90) expressed by a sheep-derived variant Giardia clone. During in vitro incubation of the cloned trophozoites, the membrane-associated form of VSP4A1 (mVSP4A1) was specifically converted to a water-soluble isoform that was continuously released into the culture medium. The time required for mVSP4A1 to decline to half of the initial amount was 7.8 h. Analysis of the two purified protein species by mass spectrometry revealed molecular mass values of 68,991 Da for mVSP4A1 and of 65,425 Da for its soluble counterpart. Amino-terminal sequencing and metabolic labeling experiments indicated that the release of mVSP4A1 was associated with the cleavage of a carboxy-terminal peptide carrying the palmitic acid recently demonstrated to be attached to mVSP4A1. Calculations using the molecular mass and predicted amino acid sequence data indicated that fragmentation of the protein possibly occurs at a site located between the lysine and serine residues of the highly conserved NKSGLS motif directly preceding the hydrophobic sequence previously postulated to serve as a membrane anchoring domain of other VSP molecules. The observed processing of the membrane-associated VSP to its soluble isoform is assumed to be an essential requirement for the ability of the parasite to undergo surface antigenic variation and thus for its establishment and survival within the vertebrate host.;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

In neuronal dendrites, MKRN1-short co-localizes with PABP in granule-like structures, which are morphological correlates of sites of mRNA metabolism. Moreover, in primary rat neurons MKRN1-short associates with dendritically localized mRNAs. When tethered to a reporter mRNA, MKRN1-short significantly enhances reporter protein synthesis. Furthermore, after induction of synaptic plasticity via electrical stimulation of the perforant path in vivo, MKRN1-short specifically accumulates in the activated dendritic lamina, the middle molecular layer of the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Collectively, these data indicate that in mammalian neurons MKRN1-short interacts with PABP to locally control the translation of dendritic mRNAs at synapses. ;polyalanine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
4529;6386443;Structural analysis and subunit interaction of insulin receptor from membranes of cultured embryonic chick heart cells.;In previous studies of cultured embryonic chick heart, insulin hyperpolarized cells and slowed their beat rate through occupancy of a high affinity receptor. In the present studies, we chemically characterize the native structure and subunit interactions of this insulin receptor. A stokes radius of 87 A and an apparent molecular mass of 350,000 daltons were found for membrane proteins specifically cross-linked to [125I] insulin by disuccinimidyl suberate. A primary subunit of 125,000 daltons in dithiothreitol or 115,000 daltons in its absence (alpha-subunit) was heavily cross-linked. A smaller subunit had a size of 90,000 daltons (beta-subunit). This beta-subunit was not readily labeled by [125I]insulin cross-linking, but insulin enhanced 32P incorporation from [gamma-32P]ATP, enabling its visualization. Subunit interaction could be studied, because alkaline conditions produced dissociation of the native 350,000-dalton receptor. This spontaneous dissociation was not a result of proteolysis and was prevented by acid conditions, oxidants, or N-ethylmaleimide. Using alkaline conditions followed by chemical reduction in two-way gels, we directly visualized the native complex of 350,000 daltons dissociating into combinations of subunits of apparent sizes of 290,000 (alpha 2 beta), 220,000 (alpha alpha), and 195,000 (alpha beta) daltons. Dithiothreitol produced combinations of subunits, which differed from alkaline dissociation. In alkaline conditions, the 290,000 (alpha 2 beta) and 220,000 (alpha alpha) dalton combinations predominated, whereas dithiothreitol produced 190,000 (alpha beta)-dalton proteins, which suggested that alpha-S-S-alpha disulfide bonds existed and were susceptible to chemical reductants, while alpha-S-S-beta disulfide bonds were more sensitive to alkaline lysis. We conclude from these observations that the native insulin receptor of embryonic chick heart cell exists on the sarcolemmal membrane as a relatively homogeneous tetramer of nonhomologous subunits in an alpha 2 beta 2 configuration. The alpha-subunits are the primary sites for insulin binding, and a beta-subunit is autophosphorylated. alpha-S-S-alpha and alpha-S-S-beta bonding exist, and these disulfide bonds have different sensitivities to chemical reducing agents and alkaline lysis.;-;-;-;hard_0
4530;17996068;Analysis of Schistosoma mansoni genes shared with Deuterostomia and with possible roles in host interactions.;"Schistosoma mansoni is a blood helminth parasite that causes schistosomiasis, a disease that affects 200 million people in the world. Many orthologs of known mammalian genes have been discovered in this parasite and evidence is accumulating that some of these genes encode proteins linked to signaling pathways in the parasite that appear to be involved with growth or development, suggesting a complex co-evolutionary process. In this work we found 427 genes conserved in the Deuterostomia group that have orthologs in S. mansoni and no members in any nematodes and insects so far sequenced. Among these genes we have identified Insulin Induced Gene (INSIG), Interferon Regulatory Factor (IRF) and vasohibin orthologs, known to be involved in mammals in mevalonate metabolism, immune response and angiogenesis control, respectively. We have chosen these three genes for a more detailed characterization, which included extension of their cloned messages to obtain full-length sequences. Interestingly, SmINSIG showed a 10-fold higher expression in adult females as opposed to males, in accordance with its possible role in regulating egg production. SmIRF has a DNA binding domain, a tryptophan-rich N-terminal region and several predicted phosphorylation sites, usually important for IRF activity. Fourteen different alternatively spliced forms of the S. mansoni vasohibin (SmVASL) gene were detected that encode seven different protein isoforms including one with a complete C-terminal end, and other isoforms with shorter C-terminal portions. Using S. mansoni homologs, we have employed a parsimonious rationale to compute the total gene losses/gains in nematodes, arthropods and deuterostomes under either the Coelomata or the Ecdysozoa evolutionary hypotheses; our results show a lower losses/gains number under the latter hypothesis. The genes discussed which are conserved between S. mansoni and deuterostomes, probably have an ancient origin and were lost in Ecdysozoa, being still present in Lophotrochozoa. Given their known functions in Deuterostomia, it is possible that some of them have been co-opted to perform functions related (directly or indirectly) to host adaptation or interaction with host signaling processes.

4531;9085842;The [U4/U6.U5] tri-snRNP-specific 27K protein is a novel SR protein that can be phosphorylated by the snRNP-associated protein kinase.;SR proteins play important roles in the recognition and selection of the 3' and 5' splice site of a given intron and contribute to the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation-mediated regulation of pre-mRNA splicing. Recent studies have demonstrated that the U1 snRNP is recruited to the 5' splice site by protein/protein interactions involving the SR domains of the U1-70K protein and SF2/ASF. Recently, it was suggested that SR proteins might also contribute to the binding of the [U4/U6.U5] tri-snRNP to the pre-spliceosome (Roscigno RF, Garcia-Blanco MA, 1995, RNA 1:692-706), although it remains unclear whether these SR proteins interact with proteins of the tri-snRNP complex. As a first step toward the identification of proteins that could potentially mediate the integration of the [U4/U6.U5] tri-snRNP complex into the spliceosome, we investigated whether purified [U4/U6.U5] tri-snRNP complexes contain SR proteins. Three proteins in the tri-snRNP complex with approximate molecular weights of 27, 60, and 100 kDa were phosphorylated by purified snRNP-associated protein kinase, which has been shown previously to phosphorylate the serine/ arginine-rich domains of U1-70K and SF2/ASF (Woppmann A et al., 1993, Nucleic Acids Res 21:2815-2822). These proteins are thus prime candidates for novel tri-snRNP SR proteins. Here, we describe the biochemical and molecular characterization of the 27K protein. Analysis of a cDNA encoding the 27K protein revealed an N-terminal SR domain strongly homologous (54% identity) to the SR domain of the U1 snRNP-specific 70K protein. In contrast to many other SR proteins, the 27K protein does not contain an RNA-binding domain. The 27K protein can be phosphorylated in vitro by the snRNP-associated protein kinase and exhibits several isoelectric variants upon 2D gel electrophoresis. Thus, the tri-snRNP-specific 27K protein could potentially be involved in SR protein-mediated protein/protein interactions and, additionally, its phosphorylation state could modulate pre-mRNA splicing.;polyarginine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
4532;12858191;Bacterial virus phi29 pRNA as a hammerhead ribozyme escort to destroy hepatitis B virus.;The DNA-packaging pRNA of bacterial virus phi29, which forms dimers and then hexamers, contains two independent tightly self-folded domains. Circularly permuted pRNAs were constructed without impacting pRNA folding. Connecting the pRNA 5'/3' ends with variable sequences did not disturb its folding and function. These unique features, which help prevent two common problems - exonuclease degradation and misfolding in the cell, make pRNA an ideal vector to carry therapeutic RNAs. A pRNA-based vector was designed to carry hammerhead ribozymes that cleave the hepatitis B virus (HBV) polyA signal. The chimeric HBV-targeting ribozyme was connected to the pRNA 5'/3' ends as circularly permuted pRNA. Two cis-cleaving ribozymes were used to flank and process the chimeric ribozyme. The hammerhead ribozyme including its two arms for HBV targeting was able to fold correctly while escorted by the pRNA. The chimeric ribozyme cleaved the polyA signal of HBV mRNA in vitro almost completely. Cell culture studies showed that the chimeric ribozyme was able to enhance the inhibition of HBV replication when compared with the ribozyme not escorted by pRNA, as demonstrated by Northern blot and e-antigen assays. pRNA could also carry another hammerhead ribozyme to cleave other RNA substrate. These findings suggest that pRNA can be used as a vector for imparting stability to ribozymes, antisense, and other therapeutic RNA molecules in vivo. ;polyalanine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

We investigated prospectively whether the response to the ACE inhibitor imidapril varied according to the ACE genotype or plasma ACE activity in Japanese hypertensive patients. The study population consisted of 57 hypertensive patients. After a 4-week observation period, imidapril was administered at a dose of 5 mg/day and blood pressure was measured every 2 weeks for 6 weeks. The plasma ACE activity in patients with the DD or ID genotype was significantly higher than that in patients with the II genotype. Neither the reduction nor the percent reduction in systolic blood pressure was significantly different between patients with either the DD or ID genotype and patients with the II genotype (DD or ID v II, 18.8 +/- 2.4 v 20.2 +/- 3.3 mm Hg; P = NS, 10.9 +/- 1.4 v 11.7 +/- 1.9%; P = NS, respectively). However, both the reduction and the percent reduction in diastolic blood pressure tended to be higher in patients with the II genotype (DD or ID v II, 7.9 +/- 1.2 v 12.4 +/- 2.2 mm Hg; P = .0669, 8.1 +/- 1.2 v 12.4 +/- 2.2%; P = .0569, respectively). The reduction in diastolic blood pressure was inversely correlated with plasma ACE activity (r = 0.301, P = .0253).

4539;20596126;Epigenetic regulation in chondrogenesis.;Epigenetics is an essential mechanism to control gene expression and fundamental cellular processes. DNA methylation in CpG-rich promoters correlates with gene silencing. Histone modification including histone acetylation and deacetylation determines the stability of the chromatin structure. Condensed chromatin (heterochromatin), which has a higher-order histone-DNA structure, prevents the access of transcriptional activators to their target genes. The fundamental unit of eukaryotic chromatin consists of 146 bp of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer. Posttranslational modifications of the histone tail and the chromatin remodeling complex disrupt histone-DNA contacts and induce nucleosome mobilization. Histone acetylation of specific lysine residues in the histone tail plays a crucial role in epigenetic regulation. Histone acetylation is a dynamic process regulated by the antagonistic actions of 2 families of enzymes - the histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and the histone deacetylases (HDACs). The balance between histone acetylation and deacetylation serves as a key epigenetic mechanism for transcription factor-dependent gene expression and the developmental process. We review emerging evidence that DNA methylation, histone acetylation modified by HAT and/or HDAC, and transcription factor-associated molecules contribute to a mechanism that can alter chromatin structure, gene expression, and cellular differentiation during chondrogenesis. ;polyglycine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
4540;18234858;Interaction between HMGA1a and the origin recognition complex creates site-specific replication origins.;In all eukaryotic cells, origins of DNA replication are characterized by the binding of the origin recognition complex (ORC). How ORC is positioned to sites where replication initiates is unknown, because metazoan ORC binds DNA without apparent sequence specificity. Thus, additional factors might be involved in ORC positioning. Our experiments indicate that a family member of the high-mobility group proteins, HMGA1a, can specifically target ORC to DNA. Coimmunoprecipitations and imaging studies demonstrate that HMGA1a interacts with different ORC subunits in vitro and in vivo. This interaction occurs mainly in AT-rich heterochromatic regions to which HMGA1a localizes. Fusion proteins of HMGA1a and the DNA-binding domain of the viral factor EBNA1 or the prokaryotic tetracycline repressor, TetR, can recruit ORC to cognate operator sites forming functional origins of DNA replication. When HMGA1a is targeted to plasmid DNA, the prereplicative complex is assembled during G(1) and the amount of ORC correlates with the local concentration of HMGA1a. Nascent-strand abundance assays demonstrate that DNA replication initiates at or near HMGA1a-rich sites. Our experiments indicate that chromatin proteins can target ORC to DNA, suggesting they might specify origins of DNA replication in metazoan cells. ;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
4541;21524066;Neomycin-neomycin dimer: an all-carbohydrate scaffold with high affinity for AT-rich DNA duplexes.;A dimeric neomycin-neomycin conjugate 3 with a flexible linker, 2,2'-(ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylamine), has been synthesized and characterized. Dimer 3 can selectively bind to AT-rich DNA duplexes with high affinity. Biophysical studies have been performed between 3 and different nucleic acids with varying base composition and conformation by using ITC (isothermal calorimetry), CD (circular dichroism), FID (fluorescent intercalator displacement), and UV (ultraviolet) thermal denaturation experiments. A few conclusions can be drawn from this study: (1) FID assay with 3 and polynucleotides demonstrates the preference of 3 toward AT-rich sequences over GC-rich sequences. (2) FID assay and UV thermal denaturation experiments show that 3 has a higher affinity for the poly(dA)·poly(dT) DNA duplex than for the poly(dA)·2poly(dT) DNA triplex. Contrary to neomycin, 3 destabilizes poly(dA)·2poly(dT) triplex but stabilizes poly(dA)·poly(dT) duplex, suggesting the major groove as the binding site. (3) UV thermal denaturation studies and ITC experiments show that 3 stabilizes continuous AT-tract DNA better than DNA duplexes with alternating AT bases. (4) CD and FID titration studies show a DNA binding site size of 10-12 base pairs/drug, depending upon the structure/sequence of the duplex for AT-rich DNA duplexes. (5) FID and ITC titration between 3 and an intramolecular DNA duplex [d(5'-A(12)-x-T(12)-3'), x = hexaethylene glycol linker] results in a binding stoichiometry of 1:1 with a binding constant ∼10(8) M(-1) at 100 mM KCl. (6) FID assay using 3 and 512 hairpin DNA sequences that vary in their AT base content and placement also show a higher binding selectivity of 3 toward continuous AT-rich than toward DNA duplexes with alternate AT base pairs. (7) Salt-dependent studies indicate the formation of three ion pairs during binding of the DNA duplex d[5'-A(12)-x-T(12)-3'] and 3. (8) ITC-derived binding constants between 3 and DNA duplexes have the following order: AT continuous, d[5'-G(3)A(5)T(5)C(3)-3'] > AT alternate, d[5'-G(3)(AT)(5)C(3)-3'] > GC-rich d[5'-A(3)G(5)C(5)T(3)-3']. (9) 3 binds to the AT-tract-containing DNA duplex (B* DNA, d[5'-G(3)A(5)T(5)C(3)-3']) with 1 order of magnitude higher affinity than to a DNA duplex with alternating AT base pairs (B DNA, d[5'-G(3)(AT)(5)C(3)-3']) and with almost 3 orders of magnitude higher affinity than a GC-rich DNA (A-form, d[5'-A(3)G(5)C(5)T(3)-3']). ;polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
4547;7361561;Renal prostaglandins and sodium balance in the rabbit: lack of effect of aspirin-like drugs.;Urinary prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and PGF2 excretion was previously found to be inversely related to sodium intake in the rabbit. Renal prostaglandin (PG) synthesis might therefore be involved in the renal handling of sodium. This possibility was tested by studying sodium excretion during inhibition of renal PG synthesis with four different nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in unanaesthetized, female rabbits. The rabbits n = 5-6) were kept in metabolic cages and chronically maintained on different sodium containing diets. On a medium salt diet (0.4% NaCl), neither treatment with indomethacin (1.5 mg/kg x 2 or 3 mg/kg x 2) nor diclofenac (1.5 mg/kg x 2) for three days changed the urinary excretion of sodium and water although the mean excretion of immunoreactive PGE2 (iPGE2) and iPGF2 were reduced by between 43-78%. On a very low salt diet (0.05% NaCl), two days treatment with aspirin (30 mg/kg x 2), diclofenac (3 mg/kg x 2), indomethacin (3.5 mg/kg x 2) or naproxen (10 mg/kg x 2) did not alter sodium excretion in any significant direction. The mean urinary PGE2 and PGF2 excretion was reduced by 35-63% and 63-85%, respectively. These results do not support a major role of PGs in the chronic regulation of sodium balance in the rabbit. The possible influence of mineralocorticoids on renal PG synthesis was studied by administration of aldosterone (100 microgram/kg x 2) for two days to rabbits on a high salt diet (2% NaCl) and cancrenoate (10 mg/kg x 2), an aldosterone antagonist, to rabbits on the very low salt diet. However, neither drug significantly changed the urinary excretion of PGF2 alpha, indicating that renal PG synthesis is not influenced by mineralocorticoids in the rabbit.;-;-;-;hard_0

In this work, we identified a cross-reactive S. mansoni gene product, referred to as SmLRR, that seems to belong to the leucine-rich repeat protein family. Comparative analysis of SmLRR revealed 57% similarity with a putative gene product encoded in the P. falciparum genome. Antibodies to SmLRR were found in experimental infections and in both S. mansoni- and P. falciparum-infected individuals. Correlative analysis of human anti-SmLRR responses in Kenya and Uganda suggested that malaria and schistosomiasis drive the immunoglobulin G3 (IgG3) and IgG4 isotypes, respectively, against SmLRR, suggesting that there is differential regulation of cross-reactive isotypes depending on the infection. In addition, the levels of anti-SmLRR IgG4, but not the levels of IgG3, correlated positively with the intensity of S. mansoni infection. ;polyleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

4556;2731572;Schisis contributes to necrosis in experimental HSV-1 retinitis.;Injection of the KOS strain of herpes simplex virus type 1 into the anterior chamber of one eye of a BALB/c mouse produces bilateral retinal inflammation which progresses in the contralateral eye to total retinal necrosis by day 10 post-inoculation. Although both immune and direct viral cytopathic effects have been proposed as causes of the initial infiltration, the precise mechanism(s) of the contralateral retinal necrosis remains uncertain. In this study, histopathological examination of the uninoculated eyes of HSV-1 injected BALB/c mice revealed the presence of vitreous traction against the internal limiting membrane of the retina which was associated with separation of the nerve fiber layer from the underlying ganglion cell layer. This separation resulted in avulsion of Mueller cell footplates and retinal vessels, hemorrhage into the schisis cavity and disruption of the underlying retinal architecture. The schisis began focally on day 8 or 9 post-inoculation, and the entire retina of most animals was involved by day 10 or 11. These results suggest that retinal schisis involving separation of the nerve fiber layer from the ganglion cell layer contributes to necrosis of the retina in the uninoculated contralateral eye.;-;-;-;hard_0

4561;21844124;Noncoding RNA gene silencing through genomic integration of RNA destabilizing elements using zinc finger nucleases.;Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) allow site-specific manipulation of the genome. So far, the use of ZFNs to create gene knockouts has been restricted to protein-coding genes. However, non-protein-encoding RNAs (ncRNA) play important roles in the cell, although the functions of most ncRNAs are unknown. Here, we describe a ZFN-based method suited for the silencing of protein-coding and noncoding genes. This method relies on the ZFN-mediated integration of RNA destabilizing elements into the human genome, e.g., poly(A) signals functioning as termination elements and destabilizing downstream sequences. The biallelic integration of poly(A) signals into the gene locus of the long ncRNA MALAT1 resulted in a 1000-fold decrease of RNA expression. Thus, this approach is more specific and 300 times more efficient than RNA interference techniques. The opportunity to create a variety of loss-of-function tumor model cell lines in different cancer backgrounds will promote future functional analyses of important long noncoding RNA transcripts. ;polyalanine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function

4571;7624119;Wild type PAX3 protein and the PAX3-FKHR fusion protein of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma contain potent, structurally distinct transcriptional activation domains.;"Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) is characterized cytogenetically by a t(2;13)(q35;q14) chromosomal translocation involving two transcription factor genes: PAX3 and FKHR. ARMS cells express a PAX3-FKHR fusion protein containing the complete N-terminal, DNA-binding domain of PAX3 and the C-terminus of FKHR. Recently we demonstrated that PAX3-FKHR is a more potent transcriptional activator than PAX3 despite impaired binding to canonical PAX3 binding sites. Therefore, we propose that the gene fusion results in switching of PAX3 and FKHR transactivation domains with distinct structure, potency or function. To compare the PAX3 and putative PAX3-FKHR transactivation domains, we fused C-terminal test fragments to the heterologous GAL4 DNA-binding domain and tested activation of a reporter gene co-transfected into four cell types. GAL4-PAX3 and GAL4-PAX3-FKHR were found to be potent activators exhibiting different concentration-dependent transactivation profiles and distinct structural motifs. Deletion mapping demonstrated essential acidic and/or serine/threonine-rich domains in the extreme 3' ends of their respective coding regions and positive modifying elements in adjacent 5' sequences. These data demonstrate that PAX3 and PAX3-FKHR contain structurally distinct transcriptional activation domains and suggest that a consequent difference in function is important for oncogenesis.

4572;16359614;Poly-(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate and the pioneering work of Rosetta Natoli Reusch.;In investigating genetic competence, Reusch and collaborators have found that the concentration of short chain poly-(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and polyphosphate (polyP) complexes increases with genetic transformability and that interrupting DNA uptake yields single-stranded donor DNA complexed with short chain PHB. This would be consistent with the organic polyphosphate, DNA, replacing the inorganic polyphosphate, polyP, in the PHB pore so allowing the DNA to be drawn into the cell. Reusch has gone on to show that PHB and polyphosphate, extracted from membranes or synthesized chemically, together form a voltage-activated calcium-selective channel. One may wonder whether the classical proteinaceous calcium channels have a short chain PHB/polyP core--and whether other ion channels have this core too. It is therefore significant that in Streptomyces lividans the potassium channel KcsA, which resembles that of eukaryotes, forms tetramers that contain polyP whilst both monomers and tetramers are covalently linked to short chain PHB. Pumps are the counterparts of channels. Reusch has also shown that a model pump, the calcium ATPase pump of human erythrocytes, contains both cPHB and polyP and has strongly implicated these polymers in its functioning. Again, one may wonder whether these polymers are essential constituents of other pumps. Reusch has gone on to show that a wide range of proteins are modified post-translationally by covalent addition of short chain PHB in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes including DNA-binding proteins such as histones. Finally, Reusch has extended the importance of short chain PHB to medicine by showing its likely involvement in atherogenic plaques and diabetes.

Selectivities are found to be in the reverse order of binding constants in the series dimethyl-beta-cyclodextrin (K1 = 6.9 x 10(3) M-1, alpha = 1.10) to hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (K1 = 0.72 x 10(3) M-1, alpha = 1.29). For beta-cyclodextrin (K1 = 1.32 x 10(3)M-1, alpha = 1.20), delta H zero provides the dominant contribution to binding but delta delta H zero and T delta delta S zero terms give comparable contributions to the selectivity. Addition of alcohol does not affect the selectivity, but allows displacement of the optimum separation conditions to higher cyclodextrin concentration through either competitive binding (with cyclohexanol) or preferential solvation of reactants (with methanol).;-;-;-;hard_0
4582;2859121;The human insulin receptor cDNA: the structural basis for hormone-activated transmembrane signalling.;"A cloned approximately 5 kb cDNA (human placenta) contains the coding sequences for the insulin receptor. The nucleotide sequence predicts a 1382 amino acid precursor. The alpha subunit comprises the N-terminal portion of the precursor and contains a striking cysteine-rich ""cross-linking"" domain. The beta-subunit (the C-terminal portion of the precursor) contains a transmembrane domain and, in the intracellular region, the elements of a tyrosine phosphokinase: an ATP-binding site and a possible tyrosine autophosphorylation site or sites. The overall structure is reminiscent of the EGF receptor; the cross-linking domain of the alpha subunit and several regions of the beta subunit exhibit sequence homology with the EGF receptor. The phosphokinase domain also exhibits homology with some oncogenic proteins that have tyrosine phosphokinase activity, in particular, a striking homology with v-ros. Southern blotting experiments suggest that the coding region spans more than 45 kb. The insulin receptor gene is located on chromosome 19.";polycysteine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
4586;8841115;Determination of the secondary structure and conformation of puroindolines by infrared and Raman spectroscopy.;"The conformation of puroindoline-a and -b, two basic lipid-binding proteins isolated from wheat seedlings, has been studied for the first time by infrared and Raman spectroscopy. The infrared results show that puroindoline-a and -b have similar secondary structure composed of approximately 30% alpha-helices, 30% beta-sheets, and 40% unordered structure at pH 7. The conformation of both puroindolines is significantly pH-dependent. The reduction of the disulfide bridges leads to a decrease of the solubility of puroindolines in water and to an increase of the beta-sheet content by about 15% at the expense of the alpha-helix content. Raman spectroscopy confirms the structure similarity between the two puroindolines with little differences in the side chains' environment. All the disulfide bridges are in a gauche-gauche-gauche conformation, and the unique tyrosine residue present in both puroindolines is hydrogen-bonded to water. Raman spectra have been recorded in both H2O and D2O media, thus providing additional information concerning the accessibility of certain residues to water. We have also observed that puroindoline-a tends to form some aggregates under acidic and high ionic strength conditions. Near-ultraviolet circular dichroism measurements suggest that the tryptophan-rich domain is involved in this aggregate formation. Finally, on the basis of a combined infrared and sequence conformational analysis, we propose a secondary structure assignment for both puroindolines. The results show that puroindolines exhibit a similar folding pattern with plant nonspecific lipid-transfer protein and some amylase-protease inhibitors. These proteins could form a homogeneous structural family of plant proteins involved in the defense against pathogens that are probably derived from a common ""helicoidal"" protein ancestor.

4590;11136710;The spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 protein, ataxin-1, has RNA-binding activity that is inversely affected by the length of its polyglutamine tract.;Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine tract within the SCA1 product, ataxin-1. Previously, using transgenic mice, it was demonstrated that in order for a mutant allele of ataxin-1 to cause disease it must be transported to the nucleus of the neuron. Using an in vitro RNA-binding assay, we demonstrate that ataxin-1 does bind RNA and that this binding diminishes as the length of its polyglutamine tract increases. These observations suggest that ataxin-1 plays a role in RNA metabolism and that the expansion of the polyglutamine tract may alter this function. ;polyglutamine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
4592;18800500;Evaluation of pharmaceuticals and personal care products as water-soluble molecular markers of sewage.;We examined the utility of 13 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) as molecular markers of sewage contamination in riverine, groundwater, and coastal environments. The PPCPs were crotamiton, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, fenoprofen, mefenamic acid, thymol, triclosan, propyphenazone, carbamazepine, diethyltoluamide, ethenzamide, and caffeine. Measurements in 37 Japanese rivers showed positive correlations of riverine flux of crotamiton (r2 = 0.85), carbamazepine (r2 = 0.84), ibuprofen (r2 = 0.73), and mefenamic acid (r2 = 0.67) with the population in the catchments. In three surveys in the Tamagawa estuary, crotamiton, carbamazepine, and mefenamic acid behaved conservatively across seasons within a salinity range of 0.4-29 per thousand, suggesting their utility as molecular markers in coastal environments. Removal of ketoprofen and naproxen in the estuary was ascribed to photodegradation. Ibuprofen and thymol were removed from estuarine waters in summer by microbial degradation. Triclosan was removed by a combination of microbial degradation, photodegradation, and adsorption. These results were consistent with those of river water incubated for 8 d at 25 degrees C in the dark in order to examine the effects of biodegradation and photodegradation. Crotamiton was detected in groundwater from the Tokyo metropolitan area (12 out of 14 samples), suggesting wastewater leakage from decrepit sewers. Carbamazepine, ketoprofen, and ibuprofen (5/14), caffeine (4/14), and diethyltoluamide (3/14) were also detected in the groundwater, whereas the other carboxylic and phenolic PPCPs were not detected and were thought to be removed during their passage through soil. All the data demonstrated the utility of crotamiton and carbamazepine as conservative markers in freshwater and coastal environments. We recommend combining these conservative markers with labile PPCPs to detect inputs of poorly treated sewage.;-;-;-;hard_0

We have used immunoglobulin gene fingerprinting, a PCR-based technique, to evaluate minimal residual disease in 5 patients in unmaintained CR 9-60 months after allogeneic BMT. All 5 patients were PCR-positive within the first year after BMT, suggesting that early PCR positivity is common and not predictive of relapse. Three patients were studied at > 1 year post-transplant; one had become PCR-negative at 1 year, a second at 2 years and the third at 4.5 years post-BMT. The ability of the technique to detect clonal evolution was demonstrated by serial studies in a further patient who relapsed post-BMT.

Maximal stimulation was found when this was done 2 to 4 h after induction and when the lowered temperature was between 29 and 32 degrees C. Compared to cultures kept at 37 degrees C throughout, the resulting IFN-alpha yields were enhanced by 2.5- to 3-fold. This was mainly due to prolonged synthesis of IFN-alpha, which could be observed up to 20 h after induction, whereas in cultures kept at 37 degrees C the production of IFN-alpha had practically ceased approx. 10 h after the addition of virus.;-;-;-;hard_0
4597;27187378;The Relationship between NALP3 and Autoinflammatory Syndromes.;The nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat/pyrin domain-containing-3 (NALP3) inflammasome, which is required for synthesis of interleukin-1β, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several autoinflammatory syndromes. This review of the literature summarizes the interconnectedness of NALP3 inflammasome with some of these disorders. Familial Mediterranean fever results from a mutation in the Mediterranean fever (MEFV) gene, which encodes the pyrin protein. Previous study results suggest that pyrin suppresses caspase-1 activation, perhaps by competing for the adaptor protein, termed, pyrin domain of apoptosis/speck-like protein containing a caspase-recruitment domain (ACS) which therefore interferes with NALP3 inflammasome activation. The nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat/pyrin domain-containing-3 (NALP3) inflammasome is constitutively activated in cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes due to gain-of-function mutations resulting from point mutations within the neuronal apoptosis inhibitor protein/class 2 transcription factor/heterokaryon incompatibility/telomerase-associated protein-1 (NACHT) domain of the NALP3 protein. Pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum and acne (PAPA) syndrome is caused by mutations in the genes encoding proline-serine-threonine phosphatase interacting protein 1 (PSTPIP1). These PSTPIP1 mutants are thought to bind to pyrin causing an increase in the pyrin domain of apoptosis/speck-like protein containing a caspase-recruitment domain (ASC) pyroptosome assembly leading to procaspase-1 recruitment and therefore its activation. Hyperimmunoglublinemia D syndrome is caused by mevalonate kinase (MVK) deficiency, which may be affected by protein accumulation that leads to NALP3 inflammasome activation. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome is associated with mutations in the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 1A (TNFRSF1A) gene which decreases the level of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR1) leading to neutralization of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. In general, these autoinflammatory disorders have shown a clinical response to interleukin-1 (IL-1) antagonists, suggesting that the NALP3 inflammasome serves a critical role in their pathogenesis.  ;polyleucine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
4601;6187705;Function of retinal nerve fibers depends on perfusion pressure: neurophysiologic investigations during acute intraocular pressure elevation.;Field potentials of the ganglion cell axons were recorded in the cat from the retinal surface during electrical stimulation of the optic tract. Using this technique during intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation, the impulse conduction was investigated independent of the neuronal input to the retinal ganglion cells. By infusing Na-Nitroprusside intravenously, the mean arterial blood pressure (BPm) of the animal was adjusted to levels between 50 and 130 mmHg. Thus, by setting the perfusion pressure (PP) to values between +30 and -20 mmHg, a large range of IOPs was tested. A PP of +20 mmHg or more left the axonal impulse conduction unimpaired, independent of whether the absolute IOP was 40 or 135 mmHg. Interruption of impulse conduction occurred first at a PP of +10 mmHg. At a PP of 0 mmHg or less, the impulse conduction ceased after a constant time interval (80-120 sec, when 20 Hz electrical stimulation was used). Recovery of the field potentials after restoring normal IOP was independent of the preceding IOP or PP. This data demonstrates that in short-term IOP elevation the electrical function of the ganglion cell axon depends on the PP and not on the absolute height of the IOP.;-;-;-;hard_0

It was found that sexual behaviour (initiation of copulation as well as copulatory behavioural pattern) of experimental males was not changed, but the ability of these males to fertilize females was evidently suppressed. In addition to significantly lower weights of testes and epididymis, inhibition of seminiferous epithelium development (aspermatogenesis) associated with the absence of spermatozoa was determined in cauda epididymidis in experimental animals. However, Leydig cells remained without changes. Plasma testosterone levels of AS RNase treated males were not altered in comparison with the controls.

4605;9528784;The Schizosaccharomyces pombe mei4+ gene encodes a meiosis-specific transcription factor containing a forkhead DNA-binding domain.;The mei4+ gene of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe was cloned by functional complementation. The mei4 disruptant failed to complete meiosis-I but could proliferate normally. mei4+ was transcribed only in meiosis-proficient diploid cells after premeiotic DNA replication. The mei4+ open reading frame encodes a 57-kDa serine-rich protein comprised of 517 amino acids with a forkhead/HNF3 DNA-binding domain in the amino-terminal region. Transcription of spo6+, a gene required for sporulation, was dependent on the mei4+ function. Two copies of the GTAAAYA consensus sequence, proposed as the binding site for human forkhead proteins, were found in the promoter region of spo6+. A gel mobility shift assay demonstrated the sequence-dependent binding of the GST-Mei4 forkhead domain fusion protein to DNA fragments with one of the consensus elements. Deletion of this consensus element from the spo6 promoter abolished the transcription of spo6+ and resulted in a sporulation deficiency. One-hybrid assay of Mei4 which was fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain localized the transcriptional activation domain in the C-terminal 140 amino acids of Mei4.

4606;34227356;[Advances in the application of affinity separation for analyzing protein ubiquitination].;"Protein ubiquitination is one of the most common yet complex post-translational modifications in eukaryotes that plays an important role in various biological processes including cell signal transduction, growth, and metabolism. Disorders in the ubiquitination process have been revealed to correlate with the occurrence and development of many diseases such as neurodegenerative disease, inflammation, and cancer. Investigation of protein ubiquitination is of great importance to uncover protein functions, understand the molecular mechanisms underlying biological processes, and develop novel strategies for disease treatment. Great advances have been made toward understanding protein ubiquitination; however, it remains a challenging task due to the high diversity of ubiquitination sites and structures, as well as the dynamic nature of ubiquitination in biological processes. Protein ubiquitination occurs through the formation of a covalent bond between the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin and the ?-amino group of a lysine residue in the substrate. As a small protein, ubiquitin itself can be further modified by another ubiquitin molecule to form homotypic or heterotypic polyubiquitin chains. There are eight sites, namely seven lysine residues (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, and K63) and one N-terminal methionine (M1), in one ubiquitin molecule that can be used to form a ubiquitin dimer. The variations in modification sites, ubiquitin chain lengths, and conformations result in differences in protein sorting, cell signaling, and function. To resolve the high complexity of protein ubiquitination, new separation approaches are required. Affinity separation based on the specific recognition between biomolecules offers high selectivity and has been employed to study the structures and functions of ubiquitination. In addition, affinity ligands are central to the separation performance. Different affinity ligands have been developed and employed for the capture and enrichment of ubiquitylated proteins. Immunoaffinity separation based on antigen-antibody interactions has been one of the most classical separation methods. Antibodies against ubiquitin or different ubiquitin linkages have been developed and widely applied for the enrichment of ubiquitylated proteins or peptides. The specific capture allows the downstream identification of endogenous ubiquitination sites via mass spectrometry and thus facilitates understanding of the roles and dynamics of polyubiquitin signals. Ubiquitin-binding domains (UBDs) are a collection of modular protein domains that can interact with ubiquitin or polyubiquitin chains. Ubiquitin-associated domains, ubiquitin-interacting motifs, and ubiquitin-binding zinc finger domains are the most frequently used UBDs. Due to the moderate affinity of UBDs toward ubiquitin or ubiquitin chains, tandem ubiquitin-binding entities (TUBEs) have been engineered with high affinities (Kd in the nanomolar range) and exhibit potential as powerful tools for ubiquitination analysis. Because of their affinity and selectivity, UBDs and TUBEs have been applied for the isolation and identification of ubiquitylated targets in cancer cells and yeasts. Compared with antibodies and UBDs, peptides are smaller in size and can be facilely synthesized via chemical approaches. The modular structure of peptides allows for de novo design and screening of artificial ubiquitin affinity ligands for targeted capture of ubiquitinated proteins. Furthermore, the polyhistidine tag at the N-terminus of ubiquitin facilitates the purification of ubiquitylated substrates using immobilized metal affinity chromatography. Considering the high complexity of biosystems, strategies combining multiple affinity ligands have emerged to further improve separation efficiency and reduce background interference. Several combinations of antibodies with UBDs, antibodies with peptidyl tags, and UBDs with peptidyl tags have been developed and proven to be effective for the analysis of protein ubiquitination. These affinity-based approaches serve as important solutions for studying the structure-activity relationship of protein ubiquitination. This review highlights the applications and recent advances in affinity separation techniques for analyzing protein ubiquitination, focusing on the methods using antibodies, UBDs, peptides, and their combinations as affinity ligands. Further, their applications in the enrichment of ubiquitin-modified substrates and the identification of ubiquitination structures are introduced. Additionally, remaining challenges in affinity separation of protein ubiquitination and perspectives are discussed.";polyhistidine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
4607;9826308;Hemodynamic and coronary effects of the endothelin antagonist bosentan in patients with coronary artery disease.;"BACKGROUND
Endothelin is a potent endothelium-derived vasoconstrictor peptide with proliferative properties. Elevated levels of the peptide occur in coronary artery disease; however, its pathophysiological role as a regulator of coronary tone and structure is uncertain. Endothelin-receptor antagonists are specific tools to clarify this issue and might be useful in the treatment of coronary artery disease.


METHODS AND RESULTS
In a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized study, we investigated the effects of the ETA/ETB endothelin-receptor antagonist bosentan or placebo on systemic and coronary hemodynamics in 28 patients with angiographically documented stable coronary artery disease by quantitative coronary angiography and an intracoronary Doppler guidewire. Bosentan 200 mg IV decreased systolic blood pressure (P<0. 05), whereas heart rate increased slightly (P<0.05). Coronary diameter increased, particularly in vessels with no or mild angiographic changes (P<0.01). Glycerol trinitrate did not further dilate these segments, whereas coronary diameter increased significantly after nitrate in the placebo group. The increase in coronary diameter after bosentan correlated inversely with plasma LDL-cholesterol levels (P<0.01) in both stenotic and angiographically normal coronary segments. Coronary flow velocity did not change. Bosentan was well tolerated.


CONCLUSIONS
Endogenous endothelin exerts a vasoconstrictor tone in epicardial coronary arteries of patients with coronary artery disease, as evidenced by the vasodilation exerted by the combined ETA/ETB endothelin-receptor antagonist bosentan under acute conditions. Bosentan can safely be given to these patients. Hence, further long-term studies are necessary to determine the therapeutic potential of endothelin-receptor antagonists in patients with coronary artery disease.";-;-;-;hard_0

By means of probability theory, it is demonstrated how information concerning errors in decisions may be estimated. With estimates of the frequencies of correct and incorrect decisions and the costs of such decisions, a utility index was defined, for which a minimum was sought as a function of the entrance requirement. Under the analytic criterion defined for utility, it was possible to determine for a number of cost systems the entrance score which would, in the long run, reduce losses to a minimum. The application of the model is illustrated using empirical data and hypothetical cost systems.

4610;3053167;The promoter of Alzheimer's disease amyloid A4 precursor gene.;The promoter of the gene for the human precursor of Alzheimer's disease A4 amyloid protein (PAD gene) resembles promoters of housekeeping genes. It lacks a typical TATA box and shows a high GC content of 72% in a DNA region that confers promoter activity to a reporter gene in an in vivo assay. Transcription initiates at multiple sites. Sequences homologous to the consensus binding sites of transcription factor AP-1 and the heat shock control element binding protein were found upstream of the RNA start sites. Six copies of a 9-bp-long GC-rich element are located between positions -200 and -100. A protein--DNA interaction could be mapped to this element. The 3.8 kb of the 5' region of the PAD gene include two Alu-type repetitive sequences. These findings suggest that four mechanisms may participate in the regulation of the PAD gene and could be of relevance for the progression of amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's disease.;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

One of these GPIIIa isoforms in which alanine replaced Cys435 reacted normally with a series of well-characterized murine MoAbs directed against the 250 amino-terminal residues of GPIIIa, whereas binding of MoAbs specific for residues 348-692 was diminished or lost. Interestingly, of eight PlA1-specific antibodies tested, two recognized Ala435GPIIIa, two did not, and four bound to it less well than to wild-type (WT) GPIIIa. However, disruption of disulfide bonds located at or near the N-terminus of GPIIIa abolished the binding of all the anti-PlA1 alloantibodies tested. These findings provide evidence that the humoral response to the PlA1 antigen is (1) heterogenous, ie, the binding site on GPIIIa for human anti-PlA1 antibodies differs from one individual to another and (2) complex--although some anti-PlA1 alloantibodies bind to an epitope comprised solely of the amino-terminus of GPIIIa, others combine most efficiently with a more complex determinant that involves the cysteine-rich domain of GPIIIa. These findings may have implications for diagnostic and therapeutic use of synthetic or recombinant PlA1 mimetics.;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
4613;29229829;PSMA-targeted polyinosine/polycytosine vector induces prostate tumor regression and invokes an antitumor immune response in mice.;There is an urgent need for an effective treatment for metastatic prostate cancer (PC). Prostate tumors invariably overexpress prostate surface membrane antigen (PSMA). We designed a nonviral vector, PEI-PEG-DUPA (PPD), comprising polyethylenimine-polyethyleneglycol (PEI-PEG) tethered to the PSMA ligand, 2-[3-(1, 3-dicarboxy propyl)ureido] pentanedioic acid (DUPA), to treat PC. The purpose of PEI is to bind polyinosinic/polycytosinic acid (polyIC) and allow endosomal release, while DUPA targets PC cells. PolyIC activates multiple pathways that lead to tumor cell death and to the activation of bystander effects that harness the immune system against the tumor, attacking nontargeted neighboring tumor cells and reducing the probability of acquired resistance and disease recurrence. Targeting polyIC directly to tumor cells avoids the toxicity associated with systemic delivery. PPD selectively delivered polyIC into PSMA-overexpressing PC cells, inducing apoptosis, cytokine secretion, and the recruitment of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PSMA-overexpressing tumors in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice with partially reconstituted immune systems were significantly shrunken following PPD/polyIC treatment, in all cases. Half of the tumors showed complete regression. PPD/polyIC invokes antitumor immunity, but unlike many immunotherapies does not need to be personalized for each patient. The potent antitumor effects of PPD/polyIC should spur its development for clinical use. ;polyisoleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

In order to characterise the function of the EGR-4 zinc finger protein, we have expressed the protein in the eukaryotic baculovirus system. The recombinant EGR-4 protein has a molecular mass of 78 kDa, as demonstrated by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. DNA binding studies revealed that the EGR-4 protein binds to the EGR consensus motif GCGTGGGCG, but not to the G-rich regulatory ZIP-element of the human IL-2 gene, that is a binding site for EGR-1. EGR-4 functions as transcriptional repressor. Overexpression of EGR-4 mediates repression of a minimal c-fos promoter through a threefold EGR consensus site. Furthermore the EGR-4 protein displays autoregulatory activities. This protein downregulates expression of its own gene promoter in a dose dependent manner. A G-rich region in the EGR-4 promoter, located at position -106 to -82, could be identified as binding site for the recombinant EGR-4 protein. A comparison of the two related zinc finger proteins EGR-4 and EGR-1 revealed for each protein distinct and specific DNA binding- and transcriptional regulatory activities. ;polyglycine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Astrocyte cultures were isolated from the cerebrums of wild-type, heterozygous, and knockout p53 neonatal mice and treated with various concentrations of BCNU. Wild-type p53 astrocytes were significantly more resistant to BCNU than were knockout p53 astrocytes, with heterozygous astrocytes exhibiting an intermediate level of resistance, Cell cycle analysis showed that wild-type p53 astrocytes treated with BCNU demonstrated a decline in the percentage of cells in G1 and an increase in the percentage of cells in G2. Similar cell cycle responses to BCNU occurred in knockout p53 astrocytes, suggesting that this effect was p53 independent. In contrast, G1 arrest was observed in wild-type astrocytes exposed to ionizing radiation and was not observed in knockout astrocytes, indicating a p53-dependent response.

4621;12483107;Structure, organization, and function of glycosphingolipids in membrane.;A large variety of glycosylation patterns in combination with different ceramide structures in glycosphingolipids provide a basis for cell type-specific glycosphingolipid pattern in membrane, which essentially reflects the composition of glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains. Functions of glycosphingolipids as antigens, mediators of cell adhesion, and modulators of signal transduction are all based on such organization. Of particular importance is the assembly of glycosphingolipids with signal transducers and other membrane proteins to form a functional unit termed a, through which glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion coupled with signal transduction takes place. The microenvironment formed by interfacing glycosynapses of interacting cells plays a central role in defining phenotypic changes after cell adhesion, as occur in ontogenic development and cancer progression. These basic functional features of glycosphingolipids in membrane can also be considered roles of glycosphingolipids and gangliosides characteristic of neutrophils, myelocytes, and other blood cells. A series of sialyl fucosyl poly-N-acetylgalactosamine gangliosides without the sialyl-Le epitope, collectively termed, have been shown to mediate E-selectin-dependent rolling and tethering under dynamic flow with physiologic shear stress conditions.

4627;8145646;"Structure and expression of the alternative sigma factor, RpoN, in Rhodobacter capsulatus; physiological relevance of an autoactivated nifU2-rpoN superoperon.";The alternative sigma factor, RpoN (sigma 54) is responsible for recruiting core RNA polymerase to the promoters of genes required for diverse physiological functions in a variety of eubacterial species. The RpoN protein in Rhodobacter capsulatus is a putative sigma factor specific for nitrogen fixation (nif) genes. Insertional mutagenesis was used to define regions important for the function of the R. capsulatus RpoN protein. Insertions of four amino acids in the predicted helixturn-helix or in the highly conserved C-terminal eight amino acid residues (previously termed the RpoN box), and an in-frame deletion of the glutamine-rich N-terminus completely inactivated the R. capsulatus RpoN protein. Two separate insertions in the second hydrophobic heptad repeat, a putative leucine zipper, resulted in a partially functional RpoN protein. Eight other linkers in the rpoN open reading frame (ORF) resulted in a completely or partially functional RpoN protein. The rpoN gene in R. capsulatus is downstream from the nifHDKU2 genes, in a nifU2-rpoN operon. Results of genetic experiments on the nifU2-rpoN locus show that the rpoN gene is organized in a nifU2-rpoN superoperon. A primary promoter directly upstream of the rpoN ORF is responsible for the initial expression of rpoN. Deletion analysis and insertional mutagenesis were used to define the primary promoter to 50 bp, between 37 and 87 nucleotides upstream of the predicted rpoN translational start site. This primary promoter is expressed constitutively with respect to nitrogen, and it is necessary and sufficient for growth under nitrogen-limiting conditions typically used in the laboratory. A secondary promoter upstream of nifU2 is autoactivated by RpoN and NifA to increase the expression of rpoN, which ultimately results in higher expression of RpoN-dependent genes. Moreover, rpoN expression from this secondary promoter is physiologically beneficial under certain stressful conditions, such as nitrogen-limiting environments that contain high salt (> 50 mM NaCl) or low iron (< 400 nM FeSO4).;polyglutamine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
4630;27656952;Effects of AMPK activation on lipolysis in primary rat adipocytes: studies at different glucose concentrations.;Adipose tissue plays a key role in energy homeostasis. Adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an important intracellular energy sensor. Effects of activation of AMPK by aminomidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) on lipolysis in the rat adipocytes were determined in the presence of 3 or 12 mM glucose. Response to epinephrine or dibutyryl-cAMP was higher in the presence of 12 mM glucose. AICAR decreased lipolysis, also when glucose was replaced by alanine or succinate and without decrease in cAMP levels. AICAR attenuated epinephrine-induced decrease in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, reduced glucose uptake and lactate release. These results indicate that short-term activation of AMPK by AICAR in the rat adipocytes inhibits lipolysis, due to changes in the final, followed by protein kinase A (PKA), steps of the lipolytic cascade and improves intracellular energy status. Similar effects of AICAR were observed in the presence of 3 and 12 mM glucose, which indicates that the AMPK system is operative at high glucose concentrations.;-;-;-;hard_0
4632;1464329;A coiled-coil related protein specific for synapsed regions of meiotic prophase chromosomes.;Synaptonemal complexes (SCs) are structures that are formed between homologous chromosomes during meiotic prophase. They are probably involved in chromosome pairing and recombination. Using a monoclonal anti-SC antibody we isolated cDNAs encoding a major component of SCs which is localized specifically in synapsed segments of meiotic prophase chromosomes. The protein predicted from the nucleotide sequence of a full-length cDNA, named SCP1, consists of 946 amino acid residues and has a molecular weight of 111 kDa. It shares several features with nuclear lamins and some recently identified nuclear matrix proteins. The major part of SCP1 consists of long stretches capable of forming amphipathic alpha-helices. This region shows amino acid sequence similarity to the coiled-coil region of myosin heavy chain. A leucine zipper is included in this region. The carboxy-terminus has two small basic domains and several S/T-P-X-X motifs, which are characteristic of DNA-binding proteins. One of these motifs is a potential target site for p34cdc2 protein kinase. The amino-terminus is acidic and relatively proline-rich, but does not contain the S/T-P-X-X motif. The transcription of the gene encoding SCP1 is restricted to zygotene-diplotene spermatocytes. A polyclonal antiserum raised against the fusion protein of one of the cDNA clones recognizes a single protein on Western blots of isolated SCs, with an electrophoretic mobility identical to that of the antigen recognized by the original monoclonal antibody (mAb), IX5B2. From a detailed comparison of the immunogold labelling of rat SCs by mAb IX5B2 and the polyclonal anti-fusion protein antiserum respectively, we tentatively infer that the carboxy-terminus of SCP1 is orientated towards the lateral elements and that the other domains of the protein extend towards the central region between the lateral elements. We conclude that SCP1 is the major component of the transverse filaments of SCs, and speculate that it has evolved by specialization of a nuclear matrix protein. ;polyproline;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
4634;9413999;A novel form of the myeloid-specific zinc finger protein (MZF-2).;Myeloid cell development is controlled by tissue-specific transcription factors. Human myeloid zinc finger protein (MZF-1) is a putative transcription factor containing 13 zinc fingers, and has been suggested that it regulates the development of neutrophilic granulocytes. Here, we have isolated the murine and human cDNAs which encode a novel form of MZF protein (MZF-2). Murine and human MZF-2 proteins consisted of 814 and 775 amino acids, respectively, and have identity of 75.3% between them. The C-terminal half of human MZF-2, carrying the zinc finger domains, was completely identical with that of human MZF-1, whereas the N-terminal half of MZF-2 was different from the corresponding region of human MZF-1, and was coded by distinct exons. MZF-2 mRNA was expressed in myeloid cells, particularly in the cells committed to the neutrophilic lineage, and down-regulated by G-CSF. MZF-1 and MZF-2 mRNAs seem to be produced by the alternative use of two different transcription initiation sites. The distinct N-terminal half of MZF-2 carries two characteristic domains, a leucine-rich domain called LeR and an acidic domain, which suggests a unique function of MZF-2 in neutrophil development. ;polyleucine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

4638;15568026;B and T lymphocyte attenuator regulates T cell activation through interaction with herpesvirus entry mediator.;"B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) provides an inhibitory signal to B and T cells. Previously, indirect observations suggested that B7x was a ligand for BTLA. Here we show that BTLA does not bind B7x; instead, we identify herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) as the unique BTLA ligand. BTLA bound the most membrane-distal cysteine-rich domain of HVEM, distinct from regions where the ligands LIGHT and lymphotoxin-alpha bound HVEM. HVEM induced BTLA tyrosine phosphorylation and association of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 and repressed antigen-driven T cell proliferation, providing an example of reverse signaling to a non-tumor necrosis factor family ligand. The conservation of the BTLA-HVEM interaction between mouse and human suggests that this system is an important pathway regulating lymphocyte activation and/or homeostasis in the immune response.

4640;6135359;Nuclear-envelope nucleoside triphosphatase: stimulation by poly(A) (+)mRNA and modulation by microtubule protein.;Nuclear envelopes contain a nucleoside triphosphatase which is thought to be involved in the supply of energy for nucleo-cytoplasmic RNA transport. This enzyme is stimulated most efficiently by poly(A) and to a lesser extent by poly(G) and poly(dT). Half-maximal stimulation of the enzyme from rat liver nuclei, which was associated with the poly(A)-specific Endoribonuclease IV and was free from poly(A) polymerase and Endoribonuclease V activity, was determined to occur at a concentration of 1.1 X 10(6) poly(A) molecules/nuclear ghost. Double-reciprocal plot analysis revealed a 2.8-fold stimulation of the enzyme by poly(A). Poly(A) in the hybrid form had no influence on the activity of the nucleoside triphosphatase. Stimulation by oligo(A) required a minimal chain length of 18 nucleotide units. Naturally occurring RNA species enhanced the nucleoside triphosphatase activity, provided they contained a poly(A) segment. Using poly(A)(+)mRNA, half-maximal stimulation was determined to proceed at 0.5 X 10(6) molecules/nuclear ghost. Removal of the poly(A) segment from mRNA mRNA abolished the stimulatory effect on the enzyme. Microtubule protein was found to inhibit the nucleoside triphosphatase efficiently. At a concentration of 2.0 mg/ml, polymerized microtubule protein reduced the enzyme activity by 96%. Dimeric tubulin was less inhibitory, while actin was without any significant effect. From these findings it is suggested that a possible nucleoside triphosphatase-mediated transport of poly(A)(+) mRNA through nuclear envelope is controlled firstly, by the poly(A) segment of this RNA species and secondly, by cytoplasmic microtubules.; polyalanine ;phosphatase activity;-;LCR_with_function
4646;18582324;Molecular interactions of alanine-rich and proline-rich regions of cell surface protein antigen c in Streptococcus mutans.;Streptococcus mutans has been implicated as a primary causative agent of dental caries in humans, and its cell surface protein antigen c (PAc) is known to be associated with sucrose-independent adhesion to tooth surfaces. PAc is composed of several domains, including an N-terminal signal sequence, an alanine-rich repeat region (A-region), a proline-rich repeat region (P-region), and an anchor region. To investigate the functions of each domain, an A-region-deficient mutant strain of S. mutans was constructed, and recombinant PAc and A- and P-region proteins were also constructed. The interactions of each domain with the recombinant proteins were analyzed using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy with a biomolecular interaction analyzing system. The A-region-deficient mutant strain showed the lowest levels of adherence to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. Furthermore, findings in an immunoblot assay indicated that the A-region protein reacted strongly with proline-rich proteins in saliva, while the recombinant P-region protein interacted more quickly with PAc than the recombinant A-region protein. These results suggest that the A-region has a strong relationship with adhesion to tooth surfaces, while the P-region has a high affinity for PAc. ;polyproline;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
4651;25931513;Key Role of Amino Acid Repeat Expansions in the Functional Diversification of Duplicated Transcription Factors.;The high regulatory complexity of vertebrates has been related to two rounds of whole genome duplication (2R-WGD) that occurred before the divergence of the major vertebrate groups. Following these events, many developmental transcription factors (TFs) were retained in multiple copies and subsequently specialized in diverse functions, whereas others reverted to their singleton state. TFs are known to be generally rich in amino acid repeats or low-complexity regions (LCRs), such as polyalanine or polyglutamine runs, which can evolve rapidly and potentially influence the transcriptional activity of the protein. Here we test the hypothesis that LCRs have played a major role in the diversification of TF gene duplicates. We find that nearly half of the TF gene families originated during the 2R-WGD contains LCRs. The number of gene duplicates with LCRs is 155 out of 550 analyzed (28%), about twice as many as the number of single copy genes with LCRs (15 out of 115, 13%). In addition, duplicated TFs preferentially accumulate certain LCR types, the most prominent of which are alanine repeats. We experimentally test the role of alanine-rich LCRs in two different TF gene families, PHOX2A/PHOX2B and LHX2/LHX9. In both cases, the presence of the alanine-rich LCR in one of the copies (PHOX2B and LHX2) significantly increases the capacity of the TF to activate transcription. Taken together, the results provide strong evidence that LCRs are important driving forces of evolutionary change in duplicated genes.  ;polyglutamine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

Moreover, the drugs currently available in the market serve to alleviate the symptoms and there is no cure for the disease. There have been two major hurdles in the process of finding the same-the inefficiency in cracking the complexity of the disease pathogenesis and the inefficiency in delivery of drugs targeted for AD.

4654;19428854;Protection from Staphylococcus aureus mastitis associated with poly-N-acetyl beta-1,6 glucosamine specific antibody production using biofilm-embedded bacteria.;Staphylococcus aureus vaccines based on bacterins surrounded by slime, surface polysaccharides coupled to protein carriers and polysaccharides embedded in liposomes administered together with non-biofilm bacterins confer protection against mastitis. However, it remains unknown whether protective antibodies are directed to slime-associated known exopolysaccharides and could be produced in the absence of bacterin immunizations. Here, a sheep mastitis vaccination study was carried out using bacterins, crude bacterial extracts or a purified exopolysaccharide from biofilm bacteria delivered in different vehicles. This polysaccharide reacted specifically with antibodies to poly-N-acetyl-beta-1,6-glucosamine (PNAG) and not with antibodies to other capsular antigens or bacterial components. Following intra-mammary challenge with biofilm-producing bacteria, antibody production against the polysaccharide, milk bacterial counts and mastitis lesions were determined. Bacterins from strong biofilm-producing bacteria triggered the highest production of antibodies to PNAG and conferred the highest protection against infection and mastitis, compared with weak biofilm-producing bacteria and non-cellular inocula. Thus, bacterins from strong biofilm bacteria, rather than purified polysaccharide, are proposed as a cost-efficient vaccination against S. aureus ruminant mastitis. ;polyasparagine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

The DNA binding ability of this series of compounds has been investigated by means of UV-vis absorption and fluorescence titrations, steady-state emission quenching with ferrocyanide as well as viscosity measurements. Results have shown that triazolopyridopyrimidine 1a interacts strongly at DNA grooves. This compound also displays preferential binding to GC-rich sequences and the ability to photooxidize guanine. Moreover, these studies have revealed the key role of the phenyl substituent at the triazole ring in the binding affinity of 1a-c. Compounds 1b and 1c did not show appreciable propensity for DNA binding, however these triazolopyridopyrimidines demonstrated to present photoinduced DNA cleavage activity, 1b being more active than 1c. DNA photocleavage mediated by these compounds takes place mainly through single strand scission events and, in a minor extent, through double strand cuts. Mechanistic investigations using radical scavengers showed that both 1b and 1c generate reactive oxygen species (singlet oxygen, superoxide and hydroxyl radicals) upon irradiation. Both type I and type II mechanisms are involved in the photocleavage process. Furthermore, compounds 1a-c were tested for their antiprotozoal activity against four different Leishmania spp. (L. infantum, L. braziliensis, L. guyanensis and L. amazonensis). Triazolopyridopyrimidines 1a and 1c resulted to be more active and selective than the reference drug (miltefosine) in vitro against L. infantum amastigotes. Compound 1a exhibited high leishmanicidal activity against L. infantum spleen forms in the in vivo test. ;polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

In order to investigate the mechanisms involved in the evolution of sfbI, the sfbI genes from 54 strains were sequenced. Thirty-four distinct alleles were identified. Three principal mechanisms appear to have been involved in the evolution of sfbI. The amino-terminal aromatic amino acid-rich domain is the most variable region and is apparently generated by intergenic recombination of horizontally acquired DNA cassettes, resulting in a genetic mosaic in this region. Two distinct and divergent sequence types that shared only 61 to 70% identity were identified in the central proline-rich region, while variation at the 3' end of the gene is due to deletion or duplication of defined repeat units. Potential antigenic and functional variabilities in SfbI imply significant selective pressure in vivo with direct implications for the microbial pathogenesis of S. pyogenes. ;polyproline;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
4659;33359128;Identification of functional methylated CpG loci in PD-L1 promoter as the novel epigenetic biomarkers for primary gastric cancer.;Gastric cancer (GC) is considered one of the most lethal malignancies worldwide due to poor prognosis. Aberrant methylation has been demonstrated to be involved in PD-L1 dysregulated expression in human cancers and possesses a great value as a diagnostic biomarker. Given that, in this study, we investigated the methylation status of PD-L1 as a promising biomarker in primary gastric tumors and identified functional CpG loci undergoing aberrant methylation through tumorigenesis of GC. PD-L1 methylation was initially evaluated in-silico using TCGA-STAD dataset. Pearson's correlation analysis was further employed to identify the most significant functional methylated CpG loci of PD-L1 gene in TCGA-STAD patient cohort. Methylation status and its correlation with PD-L1 expression were also validated using q-MSP and qRT-PCR in a set of internal samples, including 25 paired primary gastric tumors and adjacent normal tissues. The obtained results from TCGA-STAD showed that PD-L1 is significantly hypermethylated through gastric tumorigenesis, mostly in two CpG loci overlapping with cg19724470 and cg15837913 probes. Besides, PD-L1 DNA methylation was negatively correlated with PD-L1 expression in tumor samples. Furthermore, hypermethylation of cg19724470 and cg15837913 regions was validated in primary gastric tumors compared to adjacent normal samples. Also, ROC curve analysis illustrated the high diagnostic value of PD-L1 methylation for early detection of GC (AUC = 0.8110). In conclusion, the findings of this study suggested that PD-L1 expression is regulated by methylation in functional CpG loci and its methylation could be considered as a valuable diagnostic target for GC.;-;-;-;hard_0
4660;19844956;Structural and functional characterization of a triple mutant form of S100A7 defective for Jab1 binding.;S100A7 (psoriasin) is a calcium- and zinc-binding protein implicated in breast cancer. We have shown previously that S100A7 enhances survival mechanisms in breast cells through an interaction with c-jun activation domain binding protein 1 (Jab1), and an engineered S100A7 triple mutant (Asp(56)Gly, Leu(78)Met, and Gln(88)Lys-S100A7(3)) ablates Jab1 binding. We extend these results to include defined breast cancer cell lines and demonstrate a disrupted S100A7(3)/Jab1 phenotype is maintained. To establish the basis for the abrogated Jab1 binding, we have recombinantly produced S100A7(3), demonstrated that it retains the ability to form an exceptionally thermostable dimer, and solved the three dimensional crystal structure to 1.6 A. Despite being positioned at the dimer interface, the Leu(78)Met mutation is easily accommodated and contributes to a methionine-rich pocket formed by Met(12), Met(15), and Met(34). In addition to altering the surface charge, the Gln(88)Lys mutation results in a nearby rotameric shift in Tyr(85), leading to a substantially reorganized surface cavity and may influence zinc binding. The final mutation of Asp(56) to Gly results in the largest structural perturbation shortening helix IV by one full turn. It is noteworthy that position 56 lies in one of two divergent clusters between S100A7 and the functionally distinct yet highly homologous S100A15. The structure of S100A7(3) provides a unique perspective from which to characterize the S100A7-Jab1 interaction and better understand the distinct functions between S100A7, and it is closely related paralog S100A15. ;polymethionine;helix;-;LCR_with_function

4666;8530076;"Cloning of a new ""finger"" protein gene (ZNF173) within the class I region of the human MHC.";The human major histocompatability complex contains genes of both immune and nonimmune importance. Recently, several genes encoding novel, non-HLA products have been described in this area. We have performed positional cloning of short fragment cDNA sequences from the class I region of the human MHC using a hybridization selection approach. This report describes isolation of full-length cDNA clones and partial genomic clones that encode a protein that contains two domains rich in cysteine and histidine similar to those characteristic of metal-dependent DNA binding proteins (C3HC4). The predicted protein also contains a domain thought to form a coiled-coil that may promote dimerization. A third feature is a polyglutamic acid region near the carboxyl terminus of the conceptual protein. Because of these properties, we have named this gene product acid finger protein (AFP). Although the biological role of AFP is unknown at present, one potential function is binding of nucleic acids. The gene (ZNF173) is expressed in multiple tissues and is conserved among mammals. In particular, the mouse and human coding regions are highly conserved. In addition to AFP, other related sequences have been localized to the MHC, suggesting that multiple AFP-like genes exist in this area. ;polyglutamic;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
4669;30119671;Diversity pattern of Duffy binding protein sequence among Duffy-negatives and Duffy-positives in Sudan.;Vivax malaria is a leading public health concern worldwide. Due to the high prevalence of Duffy-negative blood group population, Plasmodium vivax in Africa historically is less attributable and remains a neglected disease. The interaction between Duffy binding protein and its cognate receptor, Duffy antigen receptor for chemokine plays a key role in the invasion of red blood cells and serves as a novel vaccine candidate against P. vivax. However, the polymorphic nature of P. vivax Duffy binding protein (DBP), particularly N-terminal cysteine-rich region (PvDBPII), represents a major obstacle for the successful design of a DBP-based vaccine to enable global protection. In this study, the level of pvdbpII sequence variations, Duffy blood group genotypes, number of haplotypes circulating, and the natural selection at pvdbpII in Sudan isolates were analysed and the implication in terms of DBP-based vaccine design was discussed. Forty-two P. vivax-infected blood samples were collected from patients from different areas of Sudan during 2014-2016. For Duffy blood group genotyping, the fragment that indicates GATA-1 transcription factor binding site of the FY gene (- 33T > C) was amplified by PCR and sequenced by direct sequencing. The region II flanking pvdbpII was PCR amplified and sequenced by direct sequencing. The genetic diversity and natural selection of pvdbpII were done using DnaSP ver 5.0 and MEGA ver 5.0 programs. Based on predominant, non-synonymous, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), prevalence of Sudanese haplotypes was assessed in global isolates. Twenty SNPs (14 non-synonymous and 6 synonymous) were identified in pvdbpII among the 42 Sudan P. vivax isolates. Sequence analysis revealed that 11 different PvDBP haplotypes exist in Sudan P. vivax isolates and the region has evolved under positive selection. Among the identified PvDBP haplotypes five PvDBP haplotypes were shared among Duffy-negative as well as Duffy-positive individuals. The high selective pressure was mainly found on the known B cell epitopes (H3) of pvdbpII. Comparison of Sudanese haplotypes, based on 10 predominant non-synonymous SNPs with 10 malaria-endemic countries, demonstrated that Sudanese haplotypes were prevalent in most endemic countries. This is the first pvdbp genetic diversity study from an African country. Sudanese isolates display high haplotype diversity and the gene is under selective pressure. Haplotype analysis indicated that Sudanese haplotypes are a representative sample of the global population. However, studies with a large number of samples are needed. These findings would be valuable for the development of PvDBP-based malaria vaccine. ;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
4670;15726768;Culture of preimplantation embryos: facts and artifacts.;"Mammalian preimplantation embryos normally develop within the protected environment of the female reproductive tract, which virtually precludes studies on embryogenesis in situ. Information must therefore be derived from experiments on cultured embryos. Consequently, studies on the epigenetic regulation of embryogenesis have long been interwoven with efforts to formulate culture media capable of sustaining normal development. In this review, comparative information on epigenetic regulation of embryo development is discussed, including information on energy substrate and amino acid preferences of embryos. Advantages of simple versus complex culture media, and of substituting serum albumin or synthetic macromolecules for serum, are discussed. Some potential pitfalls of co-culture are described. Culture appears to induce anomalies in embryo metabolism, which may derive from disturbed intracellular pH. Rationales for selecting endpoints to evaluate the outcome of experiments are considered, including incorporation of timing of embryo development into the analysis. Poor experimental design and/or data analysis can detract from or even negate the value of data obtained from embryo culture; examples are examined to help correct this problem. All of these points are discussed with a view to using data on the needs of embryos for making improvements in the design of culture media, so that higher yields and increased viability of embryos are achieved.";-;-;-;hard_0
4673;29636419;Transcriptome-wide discovery of coding and noncoding RNA-binding proteins.;Transcriptome-wide identification of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) is a prerequisite for understanding the posttranscriptional gene regulation networks. However, proteomic profiling of RBPs has been mostly limited to polyadenylated mRNA-binding proteins, leaving RBPs on nonpoly(A) RNAs, including most noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) and pre-mRNAs, largely undiscovered. Here we present a click chemistry-assisted RNA interactome capture (CARIC) strategy, which enables unbiased identification of RBPs, independent of the polyadenylation state of RNAs. CARIC combines metabolic labeling of RNAs with an alkynyl uridine analog and in vivo RNA-protein photocross-linking, followed by click reaction with azide-biotin, affinity enrichment, and proteomic analysis. Applying CARIC, we identified 597 RBPs in HeLa cells, including 130 previously unknown RBPs. These newly discovered RBPs can likely bind ncRNAs, thus uncovering potential involvement of ncRNAs in processes previously unknown to be ncRNA-related, such as proteasome function and intermediary metabolism. The CARIC strategy should be broadly applicable across various organisms to complete the census of RBPs. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

A specific monoclonal antibody MAb 318-28 prepared against this antigen reacts with all E. dispar strains tested, but not with any of the antigens of E. histolytica. In order to understand the function of this antigen, we constructed two plasmids, pEdA-9 and pEdA-Rev, in which the antigen-coding sequence was introduced into the pEhAct-Neo shuttle vector in the direct and opposite orientation, respectively. When E. dispar trophozoites were transfected with pEdA-9, only a slight increase was observed in the expression of the antigen. However, when E. dispar trophozoites were transfected with pEdA-Rev, the expression of the native 30 kDa antigen was significantly inhibited. This inhibition was proportional to the level of resistance of the E. dispar culture to the neomycin derivative G418.

Analysis of the 2644 bp of the 5'-flanking region of the CRIP gene revealed that the CRIP promoter lacks classical CAAT and TATA boxes but contains GC-rich regions in the proximal end of the promoter that probably function in transcription initiation. In addition to binding sites for transcription factors such as Sp-1, AP-2, OCT and GATA-2, there are multiple glucocorticoid-response elements. CRIP promoter constructs fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene and transfected into IEC-6 cells confirmed glucocorticoid responsiveness and the presence of negative acting elements. Mobility-shift assays revealed the presence of nuclear factors that bind to the CRIP promoter as a result of dexamethasone treatment. These experiments provide the initial data required to explore further the regulation of this tissue-specific developmentally regulated Zn(2+)-finger protein. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
4684;11339824;5-Bromodeoxyuridine suppresses position effect variegation of transgenes in HeLa cells.;An ectopic gene integrated in the host genome is occasionally silenced due to a position effect of its adjacent chromatin structure. We found that 5-bromodeoxyuridine clearly activated such a transgene in HeLa cells. The transgene was also activated to various degrees by inhibitors of histone deacetylase, DNA topoisomerases, or DNA methyltransferase. The peptide antibiotic distamycin A potentiated markedly the effect of 5-bromodeoxyuridine. Transient expression of an artificial AT-hook protein termed MATH20 also potentiated its effect although significantly activated the transgene alone. Since distamycin A and MATH20 are able to displace histone H1 and other DNA-binding proteins bound to specific AT-rich sequences by a dominant, mutually exclusive fashion, these results suggest that 5-bromodeoxyuridine targets such an AT-rich sequence located adjacent to the silenced transgene, resulting in chromatin accessibility. ;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
4686;1655737;Calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase from Neurospora crassa. Molecular cloning and expression of recombinant catalytic subunit.;"A cDNA for the catalytic subunit of a calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein phosphatase was cloned from Neurospora crassa. The open reading frame of 1557 base pairs encoded a protein of Mr approximately 59,580 and was followed by a 3'-untranslated region of 363 base pairs including the poly(A) tail. Based on primer extension analysis, the mRNA transcript in vivo was 2403 base pairs. Expression of this CaM-protein phosphatase mRNA was developmentally regulated, being highest during early mycelial growth; production of the corresponding protein followed mRNA with a time lag of 8-12 h. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of genomic DNA revealed three small introns, the positions of which coincided with those in the mouse gene, indicating evolutionary conservation of these structures. The deduced sequence showed approximately 75% identity with the mammalian homologue, calcineurin, in aligned regions. A region of 40 amino acids preceding the CaM-binding domain was essentially unchanged, suggesting conservation of a crucial interaction site. Three small segments in the carboxyl half of the protein were unrelated to the mammalian gene and may constitute ""variable regions"" that confer substrate specificity to the enzyme. An active recombinant catalytic subunit was expressed in bacteria and purified by CaM-Sepharose chromatography. This preparation was stimulated 2- 3-fold by CaM and showed a p-nitrophenol phosphatase activity equal to that of the bovine brain holoenzyme, although its dephosphorylation of phosphoprotein substrates was markedly different. These findings demonstrate that the catalytic subunit of this phosphatase can exhibit high activity in the absence of its intrinsic Ca(2+)-binding subunit."; polyalanine ;phosphatase activity;-;LCR_with_function
4688;15066173;Elements of the C-terminal t peptide of acetylcholinesterase that determine amphiphilicity, homomeric and heteromeric associations, secretion and degradation.;"The C-terminal t peptide (40 residues) of vertebrate acetylcholinesterase (AChE) T subunits possesses a series of seven conserved aromatic residues and forms an amphiphilic alpha-helix; it allows the formation of homo-oligomers (monomers, dimers and tetramers) and heteromeric associations with the anchoring proteins, ColQ and PRiMA, which contain a proline-rich motif (PRAD). We analyzed the influence of mutations in the t peptide of Torpedo AChE(T) on oligomerization and secretion. Charged residues influenced the distribution of homo-oligomers but had little effect on the heteromeric association with Q(N), a PRAD-containing N-terminal fragment of ColQ. The formation of homo-tetramers and Q(N)-linked tetramers required a central core of four aromatic residues and a peptide segment extending to residue 31; the last nine residues (32-40) were not necessary, although the formation of disulfide bonds by cysteine C37 stabilized T(4) and T(4)-Q(N) tetramers. The last two residues of the t peptide (EL) induced a partial intracellular retention; replacement of the C-terminal CAEL tetrapeptide by KDEL did not prevent tetramerization and heteromeric association with Q(N), indicating that these associations take place in the endoplasmic reticulum. Mutations that disorganize the alpha-helical structure of the t peptide were found to enhance degradation. Co-expression with Q(N) generally increased secretion, mostly as T(4)-Q(N) complexes, but reduced it for some mutants. Thus, mutations in this small, autonomous interaction domain bring information on the features that determine oligomeric associations of AChE(T) subunits and the choice between secretion and degradation.

4689;9626579;Superoxide dismutase in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection.;It has been reported that hepatitis C virus (HCV) may cause oxidative stress in infected cells. Patients with chronic hepatitis C exhibit an increased production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), a cytokine that can produce oxidative stress by stimulating the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cell defense against ROS includes overexpression of Mn-superoxide dismutase (SOD), an inducible mitochondrial enzyme. To investigate cell defense against oxidative stress in HCV infection, we analyzed Mn-SOD mRNA in liver and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with chronic hepatitis C. Mn-SOD expression in PBMC was significantly increased in patients with HCV infection. Patients with sustained virological and biochemical response after therapy showed significantly lower Mn-SOD than patients with positive viremia. By contrast, Mn-SOD expression was not enhanced in the liver of patients with chronic hepatitis C. The values of Mn-SOD mRNA did not correlate with TNF alpha mRNA expression, viral load, or liver disease activity. Our results indicate that in HCV infection an induction of Mn-SOD was present in PBMC but absent in the liver, suggesting that this organ could be less protected against oxidative damage. Oxidative stress could participate in the pathogenesis of HCV infection.;-;-;-;hard_0
4692;1373118;Transformation by FosB requires a trans-activation domain missing in FosB2 that can be substituted by heterologous activation domains.;"Two functionally distinct proteins derived from the FosB gene by alternative splicing have recently been described. FosB protein transforms fibroblasts efficiently, whereas FosB2 protein, a carboxy-terminally truncated form of FosB, does not, despite the fact that both proteins can participate in high-affinity, sequence-specific DNA binding as part of a heterodimeric complex with c-Jun protein. We show here that the functional difference between these proteins is the result of the presence of a potent proline-rich transcriptional activation domain in the carboxy-terminal amino acids unique to FosB. This conclusion is supported by three lines of evidence: (1) Mutations in the carboxy-terminal region of FosB that impair transcriptional activation also reduce transforming potential, despite the fact that DNA binding as part of a complex with c-Jun is not affected; (2) the carboxy-terminal region unique to FosB functions as an activation domain when fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4; and (3) transforming potential can be conferred on FosB2 by fusing any of several different well-characterized trans-activation domains. These results identify an additional functional requirement for transformation by Fos proteins and have implications for the mechanism(s) of mitogenic signaling by the AP-1 transcription complex.

4695;9390696;Intraventricular urokinase for the treatment of posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus.;This case series pilot study assessed the safety of intraventricular urokinase administration, alternating with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage. A secondary objective was to comment on whether this therapy achieves fibrinolysis, and whether this fibrinolysis is sufficient to prevent progression of hydrocephalus to requirement for ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Six preterm infants with progressive posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus requiring treatment with a ventricular drain received an infusion of intraventricular urokinase alternating with CSF drainage for 3 days. Of the 6 treated patients, the median gestation at birth was 26.5 weeks and the median age at treatment was 30 days. One patient had an elevation in CSF erythrocyte count most likely due to successful clot lysis. One patient had an elevated CSF leukocyte count consistent with transient meningeal irritation. No other side effects were noted. Fibrinolysis was achieved in the CSF, as documented by markedly elevated D-dimer levels. Clot size diminished ultrasonographically. However, all 6 patients eventually required a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. We conclude that intermittent infusion of intraventricular urokinase alternating with periods of CSF drainage is probably a safe way to achieve a fibrinolytic state. However, when administered at the relatively late point in the neonatal course when a ventricular drain is required, this fibrinolytic state is not sufficient to decrease the requirement for ventriculoperitoneal shunt.;-;-;-;hard_0
4696;29057593;Optimized Synthesis of ZSM-11 Catalysts using 1,8-Diaminooctane as a Structure-Directing Agent.;"Developing new zeolite catalysts for (petro)chemical applications is nontrivial owing to challenges that include the identification of commercially-viable syntheses. The vast majority of syntheses require the use of an organic structure-directing agent (OSDA), which has economic and environmental shortcomings. In the search for alternative zeolites to common industrial catalysts, such as ZSM-5 (MFI), a promising candidate is ZSM-11 (MEL), a close structural analogue of MFI. ZSM-11 is comprised of 3-dimensional straight channels that have less diffusion limitations than MFI. Side-by-side comparisons of ZSM-11 and ZSM-5 catalysts reveal the former exhibits significantly longer time-on-stream lifetime in many reactions; however, there are several difficulties associated with the preparation of ZSM-11, which include the ability to identify inexpensive OSDAs that produce small crystals in high yield. Here, we examine ZSM-11 synthesis using 1,8-diaminooctane (DAO), which produces ZSM-11 crystals with sizes of ca. 300 nm. We demonstrate that the use of MEL seeds allows for an order of magnitude reduction in the quantity of DAO without sacrificing crystal purity or yield (>80 %). Catalytic tests using methanol to hydrocarbons as a representative reaction show that H-ZSM-11 lifetime and selectivity are similar for samples prepared with and without seeds. Collectively our findings highlight an efficient method to produce ZSM-11 as a potential alternative to ZSM-5 for catalytic applications.";-;-;-;hard_0

Members of G group have conservative protein structure: highly homological basic region and a proline-rich domain in the N-terminal region. Here, we report that AtbZIP16 and AtbZIP68 could bind cis elements with ACGT core, such as G-box, Hex, C-box and As-1, but with different binding affinities which from high to low were G-box > Hex > C-box > As-1; AtbZIP16 and AtbZIP68 could form homodimer and form heterodimer with other members of G group; N-terminal proline rich domain of AtbZIP16 had transactivation activity in yeast cells while that of AtbZIP68 did not; AtbZIP16 and AtbZIP68 GFP fusion protein localized in the nucleus of onion epidermal cells. These results indicated that AtbZIP16 and AtbZIP68 were two new members of GBFs. In Arabidopsis, AtbZIP16 and AtbZIP68 may also participate in light-responsive process in which GBF1-3 are involved.

4699;22063044;Explaining and predicting differences in meat quality through stress reactions at slaughter: The case of Large White and Duroc pigs.;Large White and Duroc pigs (n=42) were group-reared on straw. Durocs were more active in the home pens and had higher basal urinary cortisol levels. During tests, Durocs touched more often an unfamiliar human, but not an unfamiliar object, than Large Whites. Pigs were experimentally (low stress) or industrially (high stress) slaughtered. Meat (Longissimus lumborum (LL), Biceps femoris (BF), Adductor femoris (AF) and Semimembranosus (SM)) was darker, more yellow, had higher ultimate pH and better water holding capacity after high, compared to low-stress slaughter. Large White meat contained less pre-slaughter glycogen, was redder and lost more drip. Slaughter conditions influenced ultimate pH of Large White more than of Duroc meat. Large Whites, and to a lesser extent Durocs, touching the human less often during the test, had faster early post-mortem LL and BF muscle metabolism.

4700;8600460;Molecular structure of a gypsy element of Drosophila subobscura (gypsyDs) constituting a degenerate form of insect retroviruses.;"We have determined the nucleotide sequence of a 7.5 kb full-size gypsy element from Drosophila subobscura strain H-271. Comparative analyses were carried out on the sequence and molecular structure of gypsy elements of D.subobscura (gypsyDs), D.melanogaster (gypsyDm) and D.virilis (gypsyDv). The three elements show a structure that maintains a common mechanism of expression. ORF1 and ORF2 show typical motifs of gag and pol genes respectively in the three gypsy elements and could encode functional proteins necessary for intracellular expansion. In the three ORF1 proteins an arginine-rich region was found which could constitute a RNA binding motif. The main differences among the gypsy elements are found in ORF3 (env-like gene); gypsyDm encodes functional env proteins, whereas gypsyDs and gypsyDv ORF3s lack some motifs essential for functionality of this protein. On the basis of these results, while gypsyDm is the first insect retrovirus described, gypsyDs and gypsyDv could constitute degenerate forms of these retroviruses. In this context, we have found some evidence that gypsyDm could have recently infected some D.subobscura strains. Comparative analyses of divergence and phylogenetic relationships of gypsy elements indicate that the gypsy elements belonging to species of different subgenera (gypsyDs and gypsyDv) are closer than gypsy elements of species belonging to the same subgenus (gypsyDs and gypsyDm). These data are congruent with horizontal transfer of gypsy elements among different Drosophila spp.";polyarginine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

4706;6919570;Therapy of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis experimental endocarditis.;Antibiotic therapy of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis endocarditis was investigated with the rabbit endocarditis model. Time-kill studies in vitro demonstrated that gentamicin and rifampin had the most rapid early bactericidal rates. With rifampin alone, rifampin-resistant subpopulations emerged. Combinations of antibiotics with gentamicin or rifampin in vitro did not significantly alter the killing rate but prevented emergence of subpopulations resistant to the latter. In the rabbit endocarditis model, gentamicin and vancomycin were the most effective single antibiotic regimens in terms of ability to reduce the bacterial densities on cardiac valve vegetations. Five treatment regimens were equally effective, including vancomycin, gentamicin, vancomycin plus rifampin or gentamicin, and rifampin plus gentamicin. The three-drug combination of vancomycin, rifampin, and gentamicin did not significantly improve the results. Cephalothin therapy was significantly less effective than any of the regimens noted above. It was no more effective than no treatment at 2 days and was only slightly more effective at 4 days. This result with cephalothin treatment was not predicted by routine types of in vitro antibiotic susceptibility testing. Treatment of rabbits with methicillin or cephalothin was associated with an increase in the subpopulation of bacteria resistant to the respective drugs. A number of regimens show potential for therapy of these infections, including vancomycin plus rifampin or gentamicin, rifampin plus gentamicin, and vancomycin alone.;-;-;-;hard_0
4710;8201019;Inverse patterns of myelination and GAP-43 expression in the adult CNS: neurite growth inhibitors as regulators of neuronal plasticity?;In the central nervous system (CNS) myelin is present not only in white matter, but also in varying amounts in many gray matter areas. In addition to the function of electrical insulation of axons, myelin and oligodendrocytes contain molecules that are powerful inhibitors of neurite growth. Nevertheless plastic changes involving sprouting of nerve terminals occur in several brain regions of adult animals after partial lesions. In this study we have tried to correlate the plastic potential of CNS regions with the degree of their myelination. The expression of the growth-associated protein GAP-43 was used as an indicator of the potential for plastic changes, and a histological myelin stain was used to assess myelination. We have found that myelination and GAP-43 expression have strikingly inverse expression patterns in the majority of CNS gray matter areas. Densely myelinated regions, that is, most brainstem nuclei, the tegmentum, and the inferior colliculus, are low in GAP-43. In contrast, unmyelinated or lightly myelinated areas, such as the substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord, the nucleus of the solitary tract, or the septum, express high levels of GAP-43. Areas known to show lesion-induced sprouting are typically high in GAP-43 and only lightly myelinated. During postnatal development the myelination pattern precedes the GAP-43 pattern, a sequence that is consistent with a role of myelin and the associated neurite growth inhibitors in modifying GAP-43 expression. Our results support the hypothesis that myelin-associated neurite growth inhibitors are involved in regulating the stability of neural connections.;-;-;-;hard_0
4712;18630759;The role of the plant nucleolus in pre-mRNA processing.;The nucleolus is a multifunctional compartment of the eukaryotic nucleus. Besides its well-recognised role in transcription and processing of ribosomal RNA and the assembly of ribosomal subunits, the nucleolus has functions in the processing and assembly of a variety of RNPs and is involved in cell cycle control and senescence and as a sensor of stress. Historically, nucleoli have been tenuously linked to the biogenesis and, in particular, export of mRNAs in yeast and mammalian cells. Recently, data from plants have extended the functions in which the plant nucleolus is involved to include transcriptional gene silencing as well as mRNA surveillance and nonsense-mediated decay, and mRNA export. The nucleolus in plants may therefore have important roles in the biogenesis and quality control of mRNAs.;-;-;-;hard_0
4713;8262047;MAC1, a nuclear regulatory protein related to Cu-dependent transcription factors is involved in Cu/Fe utilization and stress resistance in yeast.;The related transcription factors ACE1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and AMT1 of Candida glabrata are involved in copper metabolism by activating the transcription of copper metallothionein genes. ACE1 and AMT1 are 'copper-fist' transcription factors which possess a conserved cysteine-rich copper binding domain required for DNA binding. Here we report the identification of a nuclear protein from S. cerevisiae, MAC1, whose N-terminal region is highly similar to the copper and DNA binding domains of ACE1 and AMT1. Loss-of-function mutants of MAC1 have a defect in the plasma membrane Cu(II) and Fe(III) reductase activity, are slow growing, respiratory deficient, and hypersensitive to heat and exposure to cadmium, zinc, lead and H2O2. Conversely, a dominant gain-of-function mutant of MAC1 shows an elevated reductase activity and is hypersensitive to copper. We have identified two target genes of MAC1 whose altered expression in mutants of MAC1 can account for some of the observed mutant phenotypes. First, MAC1 is involved in basal level transcription of FRE1, encoding a plasma membrane component associated with both Cu(II) and Fe(III) reduction. Second, MAC1 is involved in the H2O2-induced transcription of CTT1, encoding the cytosolic catalase. This suggests that MAC1 may encode a novel metal-fist transcription factor required for both basal and regulated transcription of genes involved in Cu/Fe utilization and the stress response.;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
4715;8142020;5'-flanking region responsible for endosperm-specific expression of rice prolamine chimeric gene in transgenic tobacco.;The 5' upstream region (-680-(+)40) containing the complete signal peptide coding sequence of the rice seed storage prolamine gene was amplified in vitro with polymerase chain reaction from the genome of Chinese super rice cultivar Zhonghua 8. Physical map and DNA sequence analysis showed strong homology with the 5'-flanking region of rice prolamine gene reported by Kim in 1988. No changes in the signal peptide coding sequence and a long leader sequence with several small ORFs were found. Chimeric gene containing 5'-flanking region of the prolamine gene has been transcriptionally fused with the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene. The fusion junction was confirmed by both physical map and DNA sequence analysis. The resultant chimeric gene was used to transform the tobacco explants by Ti binary system of Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404. With dot and Southern blotting hybridization, three transgenic tobacco plants with the copies of chimeric GUS genes as many as 20 were obtained. Histochemical analysis revealed that the GUS activity in the endosperm tissues of tobacco seeds at the developmental stage was about 20 DAP. No GUS activity was found in leaves, stems, roots and flowers of the transgenic tobacco plants. Therefore, we concluded that the 5'-upstream cis-elements from -680 to -18 were enough to confer the endosperm-specific and temporal expression of rice prolamine gene.;-;-;-;hard_0

Characterization of the promoter region and identification of a keratinocyte-specific cis-element.;Pemphigus vulgaris antigen is a cadherin-like desmosomal cell adhesion molecule expressed primarily in suprabasal keratinocytes within the epidermis. Previously characterized structural features have defined this molecule as a desmoglein, DSG3. In this study, we have cloned the human DSG3 gene and examined the transcriptional regulation of its expression. The total gene consisted of 15 exons and was estimated to span >23 kilobases. Comparison of exon-intron organization of DSG3 with bovine DSG1 and several classical cadherin genes revealed striking conservation of the structure. Up to 2.8 kilobases of the upstream genomic sequences were sequenced and found to contain several putative cis-regulatory elements. The promoter region was GC-rich and TATA-less, similar to previously characterized mammalian cadherin promoters. The putative promoter region was subcloned into a vector containing chloramphenicol acetyl transferase reporter gene. Transient transfections with a series of deletion clones indicated that the DSG3 promoter demonstrated keratinocyte-specific expression, as compared with dermal fibroblasts examined in parallel, and fine mapping identified a 30-base pair segment at -200 to -170 capable of conferring epidermal specific expression. The results provide evidence for the transcriptional regulation of the pemphigus vulgaris antigen gene, potentially critical for development of the epidermis and physiologic terminal differentiation of keratinocytes.;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

4729;9730586;Synthetic surfactant protein analogues.;Surfactant preparations for the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) that contain phospholipids and small amounts of the two hydrophobic proteins, SP-B and SP-C, are presently obtained from animal lungs. Since structural information about SP-B and SP-C is available, it appears possible to design analogues that can replace the native proteins in synthetic surfactants. SP-C contains a single helix, but analogues with the poly-Val sequence of the native molecule do not fold into a native-like alpha-helical conformation. However, replacement of all Val with Leu yields efficient folding into a helical structure and Leu-based SP-C analogues effectively accelerate spreading of surfactant lipids and exhibit some physiological activity in animal models of RDS. The inferior in vivo activity of synthetic surfactants containing SP-C only compared to that of surfactant preparations derived from natural sources may be caused by a lack of covalently linked palmitoyl groups in the analogues and/or absence of SP-B. SP-B is significantly larger than SP-C and has a tertiary fold of several amphipathic helices in a dimeric structure. A single simplified amphipathic helical peptide containing only Leu and Lys does not mimic the surface properties of SP-B in vitro. These circumstances make the design of SP-B analogues from solely structural considerations less likely to be successful than in the case of SP-C.; polyvaline ;helix;-;LCR_with_function

The protein has cysteine-rich sequence repeats in its extracellular ligand-binding domains. Elevated levels of EGFR are associated with malignant transformation of squamous cells and are observed in squamous cell carcinomas from the lung, head, neck, skin, cervix and esophagus. We examined the expression of EGFR in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (N = 24) and non-neoplastic polyps (N = 7) using streptavidin-biotin immunohistochemistry and a monoclonal antibody (Serotec: MCA-571) to the EGFR protein. The carcinomas were classified as well differentiated (N = 2), moderately differentiated (N = 16) and poorly differentiated (N = 6). Tissues from metastatic tumor deposits in lymph nodes (N = 5) were also studied. Overexpression of EGFR was present, in the form of strong cytoplasmic immunostaining, in the majority of the SCC cases (n = 20; 83%) and in all of the metastatic tumor deposits. In contrast, although some of the vocal cord polyps showed weak (n = 2) to moderate (n = 5) immunoreactivity, none had evidence of strong EGFR immunoreactivity. The differences in EGFR immunoreactivity were significant between primary laryngeal SCC and vocal cord polyps (p = 0.0001; chi 2 test), and between metastatic laryngeal SCC and vocal cord polyps (p = 0.0001; chi 2 test). Laryngeal carcinoma cases which showed EGFR overexpression had a lower median survival period compared to those without overexpression In conclusion, a different extent of EGFR expression is demonstrated in laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas and non-neoplastic vocal cord polyps using an immunohistochemical method. Some trends in the prognostic value of EGFR immunoreactivity in laryngeal carcinomas appear to emerge in this study. ";polycysteine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function

This public health problem underscores the importance of searching for new antimicrobial molecules with different mechanisms of action. Leaf transcriptomes were used to search and develop synthetic antimicrobial peptides derived from mRNA sequences. The in silico search for new AMPs from the L. rotundifolia and L. alba transcriptomes allowed the identification of 120 putative peptide mRNA sequences. Eight of them fitted into optimal parameters and were translated and chemically synthesized antimicrobial peptides. Their biological activity was tested in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria against which they exhibited antibacterial activity. However, they showed an important hemolytic effect. Afterwards, two active peptides showing bactericidal activity isolated from each plant transcriptome tested were modified and modeled in 11 new variants to increase their antimicrobial activity and stability and to reduce or eliminate their hemolytic effect from their original peptides. The La-AMP1 (MSLLERKLLMHFLRV) the original peptide from L. alba showed a 52% hemolytic effect while the derived peptide La-AMP1a (GLMKLLRELLHMFSRVG) had its hemolytic effect reduced to 0.5% at 128 μg.mL-1.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it is an important repressor of hypoxic genes, such as ANB1, under aerobic conditions and deletion of the TUP1 gene causes a flocculation phenotype. The KlTUP1 gene from the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis encodes for a protein with 83% similarity to Tup1 in S. cerevisiae. Despite the general domain conservation, the database searches showed the absence of a characteristic Tup1 glutamine-rich domain (Q1 at positions 96-116). Instead, there was a non-conserved sequence lacking the α-helix structure in this region. The ability to act as a transcriptional repressor was tested by expressing the KlTUP1 gene, in both high- and low-copy vectors, in an S. cerevisiae tup1 mutant strain. Repression effects were studied using the aerobic repressible reporter ANB1-lacZ and the effect on flocculation. In both regulatory systems, low levels of KlTup1 caused moderate (~30%) repression, but when the number of KlTup1 copies was increased, only the ANB1 reporter raised the repression levels of S. cerevisiae Tup1. These results show the capability of KlTup1 to act as a repressor in S. cerevisiae. The lower repression reached in S. cerevisiae is discussed in terms of structural differences. ;polyglutamine;helix;-;LCR_with_function

In the present study, orthotopic growth of a syngeneic HER2/neu-overexpressing mammary carcinoma in FVB/N mice (NBT1) was associated with increased Gr1(+)CD11b(+) myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) both systemically and in the tumor microenvironment. This MDSC population had inhibitory effects on the HER2/neu-specific Th1 immune response. VVneu and VVGMCSF are recombinant oncolytic vaccinia viruses that encode HER2/neu and GM-CSF, respectively. Naive FVB mice vaccinated with combined VVneu and VVGMCSF given systemically developed systemic HER2/neu-specific immunity. NBT1-bearing mice became anergic to systemic immunization with combined VVneu and VVGMCSF. Intratumoral VVGMCSF failed to result in systemic antitumor immunity until combined with intratumoral VVneu. Infection/transfection of the tumor microenvironment with combined VVGMCSF and VVneu resulted in development of systemic tumor-specific immunity, reduction in splenic and tumor MDSC and therapeutic efficacy against tumors. These studies demonstrate the enhanced efficacy of oncolytic vaccinia virus recombinants encoding combined tumor antigen and GM-CSF in modulating the microenvironment of MDSC-rich tumors.  ;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
4743;8114696;Species-specific interaction of the glutamine-rich activation domains of Sp1 with the TATA box-binding protein.;We have used protein-blotting and protein affinity chromatography to demonstrate that each of the two glutamine-rich activation domains of the human transcription factor Sp1 can bind specifically and directly to the C-terminal evolutionarily conserved domain of the human TATA box-binding protein (TBP). These activation domains of Sp1 also bind directly to Drosophila TBP but bind much less strongly to TBP from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The abilities of the Sp1 activation domains to interact directly with the TBPs of various species correlate well with their abilities to activate transcription in extracts derived from the same species. We also show that a glutamine-rich transcriptional activating region of the Drosophila protein Antennapedia binds directly to TBP in a species-specific manner that reflects its ability to activate transcription in vivo. These results support the notion that TBP is a direct and important target of glutamine-rich transcriptional activators.;polyglutamine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
4744;8662193;The regulatory protein NIT4 that mediates nitrate induction in Neurospora crassa contains a complex tripartite activation domain with a novel leucine-rich, acidic motif.;"Expression of nit-3 and nit-6, the structural genes which encode nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase in Neurospora crassa, requires the global-acting NIT2 and the pathway specific NIT4 regulatory proteins. NIT4, which consists of 1090 amino-acid residues, possesses a Cys6/Zn2 zinc cluster DNA-binding-domain. NIT4 was dissected to localize transactivation domains by fusion of various segments of NIT4 to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 for in vivo analysis in yeast. Three separate activation subdomains, and one negative-acting region, which function in yeast were located in the carboxyl-terminal region of NIT4. The C-terminal tail of 28 amino-acid residues was identified as a minimal activation domain and consists of a novel leucine-rich, acidic region. Most deletions which removed even small segments of the NIT4 protein were found to lead to the loss of NIT4 function in vivo in N. crassa, implying that the central region of the protein which lies between the DNA-binding and activation domains is essential for function. The yeast two-hybrid system was employed to identify regions of NIT4 responsible for dimer formation. A short isoleucine-rich segment downstream from the zinc cluster, predicted to form a coiled coil, allowed dimerization in vivo; this same isoleucine-rich region also showed dimerization in vitro when examined via chemical cross linking. The enzyme nitrate reductase has been postulated to exert autogenous regulation by directly interacting with the NIT4 protein. This possible nitrate reductase-NIT4 interaction was investigated with the yeast two-hybrid system and by direct in vitro binding assays; both assays failed to identify such a protein-protein interaction.";polyisoleucine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
4745;28629183;An Amyloidogenic Sequence at the N-Terminus of the Androgen Receptor Impacts Polyglutamine Aggregation.;The human androgen receptor (AR) is a ligand inducible transcription factor that harbors an amino terminal domain (AR-NTD) with a ligand-independent activation function. AR-NTD is intrinsically disordered and displays aggregation properties conferred by the presence of a poly-glutamine (polyQ) sequence. The length of the polyQ sequence as well as its adjacent sequence motifs modulate this aggregation property. AR-NTD also contains a conserved KELCKAVSVSM sequence motif that displays an intrinsic property to form amyloid fibrils under mild oxidative conditions. As peptide sequences with intrinsic oligomerization properties are reported to have an impact on the aggregation of polyQ tracts, we determined the effect of the KELCKAVSVSM on the polyQ stretch in the context of the AR-NTD using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Here, we present evidence for a crosstalk between the amyloidogenic properties of the KELCKAVSVSM motif and the polyQ stretch at the AR-NTD. ;polyglutamine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
4753;23083740;Drosophila CPEB Orb2A mediates memory independent of Its RNA-binding domain.;Long-term memory and synaptic plasticity are thought to require the synthesis of new proteins at activated synapses. The CPEB family of RNA binding proteins, including Drosophila Orb2, has been implicated in this process. The precise mechanism by which these molecules regulate memory formation is however poorly understood. We used gene targeting and site-specific transgenesis to specifically modify the endogenous orb2 gene in order to investigate its role in long-term memory formation. We show that the Orb2A and Orb2B isoforms, while both essential, have distinct functions in memory formation. These two isoforms have common glutamine-rich and RNA-binding domains, yet Orb2A uniquely requires the former and Orb2B the latter. We further show that Orb2A induces Orb2 complexes in a manner dependent upon both its glutamine-rich region and neuronal activity. We propose that Orb2B acts as a conventional CPEB to regulate transport and/or translation of specific mRNAs, whereas Orb2A acts in an unconventional manner to form stable Orb2 complexes that are essential for memory to persist. ;polyglutamine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

The incidence rate of anal cancer for single males was 6.1 times that for married males (P less than 0.001). This excess was limited to squamous and transitional cell carcinomas and was reasonably consistent by age, stage, subsite, social class and race. Single women were not at increased risk, but separated and divorced persons of both sexes were at increased risk compared to married persons. Anal cancers were more common in males under the age of 35, after which there was a substantial female predominance. This relative excess in older women occurred at all stages, subsites, and social classes of whites and also in blacks, but not in Hispanics, among whom women had lower overall incidence rates compared to both whites and blacks. The findings were consistent with the hypothesis that sexual activity involving the anus is related to anal cancer. We could not rule out the possibility that anal cancer is related to the acquired immune-deficiency syndrome (AIDS) since the incidence in young single men appears to have increased in 1980 and 1981.;-;-;-;hard_0
4758;9763421;Fab1p is essential for PtdIns(3)P 5-kinase activity and the maintenance of vacuolar size and membrane homeostasis.;The Saccharomyces cerevisiae FAB1 gene encodes a 257-kD protein that contains a cysteine-rich RING-FYVE domain at its NH2-terminus and a kinase domain at its COOH terminus. Based on its sequence, Fab1p was initially proposed to function as a phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P) 5-kinase (). Additional sequence analysis of the Fab1p kinase domain, reveals that Fab1p defines a subfamily of putative PtdInsP kinases that is distinct from the kinases that synthesize PtdIns(4,5)P2. Consistent with this, we find that unlike wild-type cells, fab1Delta, fab1(tsf), and fab1 kinase domain point mutants lack detectable levels of PtdIns(3,5)P2, a phosphoinositide recently identified both in yeast and mammalian cells. PtdIns(4,5)P2 synthesis, on the other hand, is only moderately affected even in fab1Delta mutants. The presence of PtdIns(3)P in fab1 mutants, combined with previous data, indicate that PtdIns(3,5)P2 synthesis is a two step process, requiring the production of PtdIns(3)P by the Vps34p PtdIns 3-kinase and the subsequent Fab1p- dependent phosphorylation of PtdIns(3)P yielding PtdIns(3,5)P2. Although Vps34p-mediated synthesis of PtdIns(3)P is required for the proper sorting of hydrolases from the Golgi to the vacuole, the production of PtdIns(3,5)P2 by Fab1p does not directly affect Golgi to vacuole trafficking, suggesting that PtdIns(3,5)P2 has a distinct function. The major phenotypes resulting from Fab1p kinase inactivation include temperature-sensitive growth, vacuolar acidification defects, and dramatic increases in vacuolar size. Based on our studies, we hypothesize that whereas Vps34p is essential for anterograde trafficking of membrane and protein cargoes to the vacuole, Fab1p may play an important compensatory role in the recycling/turnover of membranes deposited at the vacuole. Interestingly, deletion of VAC7 also results in an enlarged vacuole morphology and has no detectable PtdIns(3,5)P2, suggesting that Vac7p functions as an upstream regulator, perhaps in a complex with Fab1p. We propose that Fab1p and Vac7p are components of a signal transduction pathway which functions to regulate the efflux or turnover of vacuolar membranes through the regulated production of PtdIns(3,5)P2. ;polycysteine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function

We investigated the feasibility of cellular immunotherapy using autologous alpha-type 1-polarized dendritic cells (αDC1s) loaded with apoptotic allogeneic myeloma cells, which could generate myeloma-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) against autologous myeloma cells in myeloma patients. Monocyte-derived DCs were matured by adding the αDC1-polarizing cocktail (TNFα/IL-1β/IFN-α/IFN-γ/poly-I:C) and loaded with apoptotic allogeneic CD138(+) myeloma cells from other patients with matched monoclonal immunoglobulins as a tumor antigen. There were no differences in the phenotypic expression between αDC1s loaded with apoptotic autologous and allogeneic myeloma cells. Autologous αDC1s effectively took up apoptotic allogeneic myeloma cells from other patients with matched subtype. Myeloma-specific CTLs against autologous target cells were successfully induced by αDC1s loaded with allogeneic tumor antigen. The cross-presentation of apoptotic allogeneic myeloma cells to αDC1s could generate CTL responses between myeloma patients with individual matched monoclonal immunoglobulins. There was no difference in CTL responses between αDC1s loaded with autologous tumor antigen and allogeneic tumor antigen against targeting patient's myeloma cells. Our data indicate that autologous DCs loaded with allogeneic myeloma cells with matched immunoglobulin can generate potent myeloma-specific CTL responses against autologous myeloma cells and can be a highly feasible and effective method for cellular immunotherapy in myeloma patients. ;polyisoleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
4764;34712250;Kernel Water Relations and Kernel Filling Traits in Maize (Zea mays L.) Are Influenced by Water-Deficit Condition in a Tropical Environment.;"Water deficit is a major limiting condition for adaptation of maize in tropical environments. The aims of the current observations were to evaluate the kernel water relations for determining kernel developmental progress, rate, and duration of kernel filling, stem reserve mobilization in maize. In addition, canopy temperature, cell membrane stability, and anatomical adaptation under prolonged periods of pre- and post-anthesis water deficit in different hybrids was quantified to support observations related to kernel filling dynamics. In this context, two field experiments in two consecutive years were conducted with five levels of water regimes: control (D1), and four water deficit treatments [V10 to V13 (D2); V13 to V17 (D3); V17 to blister stage (D4); blisters to physiological maturity (D5)], on three maize hybrids (Pioneer 30B80, NK 40, and Suwan 4452) in Expt. 1. Expt. 2 had four water regimes: control (D1), three water deficit treatments [V10 to anthesis (D2); anthesis to milk stage (D3); milk to physiological maturity (D4)], and two maize hybrids (NK 40 and Suwan 4452). Water deficit imposed at different stages significantly reduced maximum kernel water content (MKWC), kernel filling duration (KFD), final kernel weight (FKW), and kernel weight ear-1 while it increased kernel water loss rate (KWLR), kernel filling rate (KFR), and stem weight depletion (SWD) across maize hybrids in both experiments. The lowest MKWC under water deficit was at D3 in both experiments, indicating that lower KFR results in lowest FKW in maize. Findings indicate that the MKWC (R 2 = 0.85 and 0.41) and KFR (R 2 = 0.62 and 0.37) were positively related to FKW in Expt. 1 and 2, respectively. The KFD was reduced by 5, 7, 7, and 11 days under water deficit at D3, D4 in Expt. 2 and D4, D5 in Expt. 1 as compared to control, respectively. Water deficit at D5 in Expt. 1 and D4 in Expt. 2 increased KWLR, KFR, and SWD. In Expt. 2, lower canopy temperature and electrical conductivity indicated cell membrane stability across water regimes in NK 40. Hybrid NK 40 under water deficit had significantly higher cellular adaptation by increasing the number of xylem vessel while reducing vessel diameter in leaf mid-rib and attached leaf blade. These physiological adjustments improved efficient transport of water from root to the shoot, which in addition to higher kernel water content, MKWC, KFD, KFR, and stem reserve mobilization capacity, rendered NK 40 to be better adapted to water-deficit conditions under tropical environments.";-;-;-;hard_0
4766;7757998;Invading and metastasizing cardiac hemangioendothelial neoplasms in a cohort of the fish Rivulus marmoratus: unusually high prevalence, histopathology, and possible etiologies.;An unusually high, unprecedented prevalence of cardiac hemangioendotheliomata, including hemangiomas, hemangioendotheliomas, and hemangioendotheliosarcomas, was found in a laboratory cohort of the small, teleost fish Rivulus marmoratus. The neoplasms occurred in 51 of 204 fish (25%) used in a carcinogenicity study of butylated hydroxyanisole fed in a lyophilized chicken liver diet for up to 9 months. The cardiac neoplasms occurred in approximately equal numbers of both control (fed lyophilized chicken liver but not exposed to butylated hydroxyanisole) and exposed (fed 0.8% butylated hydroxyanisole in chicken liver) fish. The neoplasms occurred in the bulbus arteriosus and ventricle (accompanied by an intense epicarditis), and in some cases, in the gills. At least one case of hemangioma was characterized by cavernous vessels in the bulbar wall. Hemangioendothelioma cases consisted of pleomorphic endothelial cells that formed continuous tracts and anastomosing, typical vascular channels of varying sizes. The hemangioendotheliosarcomas consisted of atypical, spindle, polygonal, or round endothelial cells that formed solid tumor masses that contained abnormal vessels with atypical endothelium tufting into their lumina. Some fish had neoplasm cases containing varying regions with mixtures of the above features. Incipient neoplasms occurred on/in the semilunar valves, and their cells appeared to invade the adjacent walls of the bulbus and/or the ventricle. The gill lesions represented possible metastatic neoplasms, probably formed by atypical endothelial cells that exfoliated from the edges of cardiac neoplasms into the lumina of the ventricle or bulbus and were then pumped to the arterioles of the gills via the ventral aorta. Fish examined from the original colony in the laboratory and from the wild had no neoplasms. Possible causes are discussed, and studies are under way in an attempt to determine the etiology of the neoplasm and to evaluate Rivulus marmoratus as a possible model organism for study of these types of cardiac neoplasms.;-;-;-;hard_0

Among all the species of non-coding RNAs, small non-coding RNAs (miRNAs, siRNAs and piRNAs) have been shown to be in the core of the regulatory machinery of all the genomic output in eukaryotic cells. Small non-coding RNAs are produced by several pathways containing specialized enzymes that process RNA transcripts. The mechanism of action of these molecules is also ensured by a group of effector proteins that are commonly engaged within high molecular weight protein-RNA complexes. In the last decade, the contribution of structural biology has been essential to the dissection of the molecular mechanisms involved in the biosynthesis and function of small non-coding RNAs.;-;-;-;hard_0
4770;25403012;Intrinsic flexibility of NLRP pyrin domains is a key factor in their conformational dynamics, fold stability, and dimerization.;Nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat-containing receptors (NLRs) are key proteins in the innate immune system. The 14 members of the NLRP family of NLRs contain an N-terminal pyrin domain which is central for complex formation and signal transduction. Recently, X-ray structures of NLRP14 revealed an unexpected rearrangement of the α5/6 stem-helix of the pyrin domain allowing a novel symmetric dimerization mode. We characterize the conformational transitions underlying NLRP oligomerization using molecular dynamics simulations. We describe conformational stability of native NLRP14 and mutants in their monomeric and dimeric states and compare them to NLRP4, a representative of a native pyrin domain fold. Thereby, we characterize the interplay of conformational dynamics, fold stability, and dimerization in NLRP pyrin domains. We show that intrinsic flexibility of NLRP pyrin domains is a key factor influencing their behavior in physiological conditions. Additionally, we provide further evidence for the crucial importance of a charge relay system within NLRPs that critically influences their conformational ensemble in solution.  ;polyleucine;helix;-;LCR_with_function

A 777-bp cDNA (C32) was isolated from a S. japonicum lambda ZAPII cDNA expression library immuno-screened with hyperimmune rabbit serum (HRS) raised against soluble adult S. japonicum proteins. The open reading frame of C32 encodes a protein of 191 amino acids (aa) which exhibits 71% identity to a 22.6-kDa membrane-associated antigen of S. mansoni, a putative vaccine candidate for schistosomiasis. We have identified a sequence motif known as an EF-hand calcium-binding domain in both the S. japonicum and S. mansoni aa sequences, suggesting that the 22.6-kDa antigens are able to bind Ca2+. Further, we have, for the first time, obtained the 22.6-kDa antigen in purified, non-denatured, recombinant form, and in sufficient quantity to assess the protective value of the molecule in vaccination/challenge experiments.

Maximal inspiratory pressure (PI(max)) proved sensitive in predicting nocturnal O(2) saturation. However, PI(max) is highly dependent on patient collaboration; on the other hand Mouth Occlusion Pressure (MOP) is a reliable, non-volitional parameter index of central respiratory drive. Since exercise testing (ET) is also part of the assessment of ventilatory regulation the authors aimed to determine whether MOP and ET are sensitive and reliable parameters predictive of nocturnal O(2) saturation and clinical evolution. We conducted a Polysomnographic (PSG) study in two groups of 14 patients, selected according to their MOP level. Patients performed at admission an ET, Respiratory Function tests (RFT) and clinical evaluation with Norris spinal and bulbar scores (SNS and BNS). All patients in Group I (Low MOP) had decreased O(2) saturation during ET (P<0.001). Correlation study showed correlation between ET and MOP (R=0.6); PI(max) slope and PE(max) slope correlated with ET (R=-0.4; -0.6), respectively. ET also correlated with nocturnal O(2) saturation and SNS slope (R=0.8; -0.5), respectively. SNS and BNS slopes correlated with nocturnal O(2) saturation (R=-0.4; -0.7), respectively. The best correlations found were between MOP slope and BNS slope and SNS slope (R=0.8; 0.7), respectively. The high predictive values of MOP and ET at admission to nocturnal O(2) saturation (predicted value=80%) suggested the need of nocturnal pulse oximetry as a standard procedure.

4777;2433111;A flow cytometric study of DNA staining in situ in exponentially growing and stationary Euglena gracilis.;DNA stainability by different fluorochromes has been compared in exponentially dividing and stationary Euglena cells. With the intercalating fluorochromes, ethidium bromide, acridine orange and DAPI, a decrease of fluorescence intensity of the G1 cells is observed when cells enter stationary stage. However this decrease of fluorescence is not obtained with the nonintercalating fluorochrome Hoechst 33258. If nuclear basic proteins are extracted, however, the intensity of staining by either Hoechst 33258 or ethidium-bromide is comparable in stationary and dividing cells. Therefore, the decrease of fluorescence intensity of the G1 cells observed during the transition from exponential to stationary phase is not due to a loss of DNA but is related to the exposure of chromatin binding sites for ethidium bromide.

4779;15701806;Activation of an AP1-like transcription factor of the maize pathogen Cochliobolus heterostrophus in response to oxidative stress and plant signals.;Redox sensing is a ubiquitous mechanism regulating cellular activity. Fungal pathogens face reactive oxygen species produced by the host plant's oxidative burst in addition to endogenous reactive oxygen species produced during aerobic metabolism. An array of preformed and induced detoxifying enzymes, including superoxide dismutase, catalases, and peroxidases, could allow fungi to infect plants despite the oxidative burst. We isolated a gene (CHAP1) encoding a redox-regulated transcription factor in Cochliobolus heterostrophus, a fungal pathogen of maize. CHAP1 is a bZIP protein that possesses two cysteine-rich domains structurally and functionally related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae YAP1. Deletion of CHAP1 in C. heterostrophus resulted in decreased resistance to oxidative stress caused by hydrogen peroxide and menadione, but the virulence of chap1 mutants was unaffected. Upon activation by oxidizing agents or plant signals, a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-CHAP1 fusion protein became localized in the nucleus. Expression of genes encoding antioxidant proteins was induced in the wild type but not in chap1 mutants. Activation of CHAP1 occurred from the earliest stage of plant infection, in conidial germ tubes on the leaf surface, and persisted during infection. Late in the course of infection, after extensive necrotic lesions were formed, GFP-CHAP1 redistributed to the cytosol in hyphae growing on the leaf surface. Localization of CHAP1 to the nucleus may, through changes in the redox state of the cell, provide a mechanism linking extracellular cues to transcriptional regulation during the plant-pathogen interaction. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

In order to solve these issues, two types of strategies are reported, i.e., (i) synthesis of peapod-like hollow SnO2 nanostructures (hollow 0D-1D SnO2 ) by using fluid dynamics of liquid Sn metal and (ii) metal-protein chelate driven uniform catalyst functionalization. The hollow 0D-1D SnO2 nanostructures have advantages in enhanced gas accessibility and higher surface areas. In addition to structural benefits, protein encapsulated catalytic nanoparticles result in the uniform catalyst functionalization on both hollow SnO2 spheres and SnO2 nanotubes due to their dynamic migration properties. The migration of catalysts with liquid Sn metal is induced by selective location of catalysts around Sn. On the basis of these structural and uniform functionalization of catalyst benefits, biomarker chemical sensors are developed, which deliver highly selective detection capability toward acetone and toluene, respectively.

4785;9260987;Renal hemodynamic response to an angiotensin II antagonist, eprosartan, in healthy men.;"In view of the vasodilator potential of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition via prostaglandins and kinins, we asked why renin inhibition induces a larger renal vasodilator response than ACE inhibitors in healthy humans in earlier studies. One possibility was that there was a more complete blockade of the renin system, which could also be achieved by an angiotensin II antagonist, eprosartan. We measured the hormonal and renal hemodynamic responses to eprosartan doses, from 10 to 400 mg in 9 healthy young men in balance on a 10-mmol/d sodium intake. The threshold eprosartan dose to influence renal perfusion was <10 mg, and the 100-mg dose induced a near-maximal vasodilator response of 135+/-19.7 mL x min(-1) x 1.73 m2. When the dose was increased to 400 mg, there was a modest additional increase of 147+/-57 mL x min(-1) x 1.73 m(-2). A highly significant dose-related fall in arterial blood pressure occurred (r=-.97; P<.001), with no indication of a maximal response at 400 mg. In 6 additional subjects, we compared responses to eprosartan on a high salt and a low salt diet. The renal response to 200 mg eprosartan on a high salt diet, 26.0+/-6.6 mL x min(-1) x 1.73 m(-2), was significantly less than that seen with the low salt diet (P<.001). There was no renal partial agonist angiotensin-like effect of eprosartan. Eprosartan reduced sharply the pressor, renal vascular, and hormonal responses to exogenous angiotensin II. The renal vasodilator response to the angiotensin II antagonist eprosartan closely resembles responses to renin inhibition and exceeds previously reported responses to ACE inhibitors. Thus, eprosartan probably exerted its effect via the angiotensin receptor. More complete blockade of the renin system can be achieved by pharmacological interruption at this level, a finding that could have therapeutic implications.";-;-;-;hard_0

Atomistic Molecular Dynamics simulations have been carried out for three systems consisting of the same DNA fragment d(CGCGAATTCGCGAATTCGCG) with different polyamines. The results show that polyamine molecules are localized with well-recognized patterns along the double helix with different residence times. We observed a clear hierarchy in the residence times of the polyamines, with the longest residence time (ca 100ns) in the minor groove. The analysis of the sequence dependence shows that polyamine molecules prefer the A-tract regions of the minor groove - in its narrowest part. The preferable localization of putrescine2+, spermidine3+ and spermine4+ in the minor groove with A-tract motifs is correlated with modulation of the groove width by a specific nucleotide sequences. We did develop a theoretical model pointing to the electrostatic interactions as the main driving force in this phenomenon, making it even more prominent for polyamines with higher charges. The results of the study explain the specificity of polyamine interactions with A-tract region of the DNA double helix which is also observed in experiments. ;polyalanine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
4791;9539837;[An experience of lipoprotein (a) dosage in a Moroccan population of 184 subjects].;One hundred and eighty-four patients underwent complete lipid analysis (total cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoproteins A1 and B, lipoprotein (a)) and coronary angiography, in order to evaluate the discriminant value of the lipoprotein (a). Subjects with non-significant coronary stenoses (< 50% of the lumen) were used as a control group (n = 84). The others were considered to be pathological. The total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides were measured by an enzymatic colorimetric method. The LDL cholesterol was calculated by Friedewald's formula. The apolipoprotein A1 and B were measured by immunoturbidimetry and the lipoprotein (a) by an Elisa. The results showed a relationship between the different lipid levels, especially between high lipoprotein (a), and the severity of the coronary disease. A quantitative and qualitative study showed no significant influence of the other risk factors on the mean lipoprotein (a) level. Gender and age had no influence. Therefore, the higher the lipoprotein (a) level, the greater was the coronary risk, independently of the other associated risk factors.;-;-;-;hard_0
4792;23129290;"TCF4 (e2-2; ITF2): a schizophrenia-associated gene with pleiotropic effects on human disease.";"Common SNPs in the transcription factor 4 (TCF4; ITF2, E2-2, SEF-2) gene, which encodes a basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) transcription factor, are associated with schizophrenia, conferring a small increase in risk. Other common SNPs in the gene are associated with the common eye disorder Fuch's corneal dystrophy, while rare, mostly de novo inactivating mutations cause Pitt-Hopkins syndrome. In this review, we present a systematic bioinformatics and literature review of the genomics, biological function and interactome of TCF4 in the context of schizophrenia. The TCF4 gene is present in all vertebrates, and although protein length varies, there is high conservation of primary sequence, including the DNA binding domain. Humans have a unique leucine-rich nuclear export signal. There are two main isoforms (A and B), as well as complex splicing generating many possible N-terminal amino acid sequences. TCF4 is highly expressed in the brain, where plays a role in neurodevelopment, interacting with class II bHLH transcription factors Math1, HASH1, and neuroD2. The Ca(2+) sensor protein calmodulin interacts with the DNA binding domain of TCF4, inhibiting transcriptional activation. It is also the target of microRNAs, including mir137, which is implicated in schizophrenia. The schizophrenia-associated SNPs are in linkage disequilibrium with common variants within putative DNA regulatory elements, suggesting that regulation of expression may underlie association with schizophrenia. Combined gene co-expression analyses and curated protein-protein interaction data provide a network involving TCF4 and other putative schizophrenia susceptibility genes. These findings suggest new opportunities for understanding the molecular basis of schizophrenia and other mental disorders. ";polyleucine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
4794;7588075;Progressive maturation of chromatin structure regulates HSP70.1 gene expression in the preimplantation mouse embryo.;In the widely studied model organisms, Drosophila and Xenopus, early embryogenesis involves an extended series of nuclear divisions prior to activation of the zygotic genome. The mammalian embryo differs in that the early cleavage phase is already characterized by regulated cell cycles with specific zygotic gene expression. In the mouse, where major activation of the zygotic genome occurs at the 2-cell stage, the HSP70.1 gene is among the earliest genes to be expressed. We investigated the developmentally regulated expression of this gene during the preimplantation period, using a luciferase transgene, with or without flanking scaffold attachment regions (SARs). Cleavage stage-specific modifications in expression profiles were examined in terms of histone H4 acetylation status, topoisomerase II activity, and the localisation of HMG-I/Y, a nuclear protein with known affinity for the AT-tracts of SARs. We demonstrate that HSP70.1-associated transcription factors are not limiting, and that instead, there is a progressive maturation of chromatin structure that is directly involved in HSP70.1 regulation during early mouse development.;polythreonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
4795;9073170;Gene structure and 5'-flanking regulatory region of the murine serotonin transporter.;By modulating the magnitude and duration of postsynaptic responses, carrier-facilitated serotonin (5-HT) transport into and release from the presynaptic neuron is central to the fine tuning of serotonergic neurotransmission. The 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) is the prime target for widely used antidepressants, psychostimulants, drugs of abuse and neurotoxins. We have isolated the gene encoding the murine 5-HTT and determined the sequence of all exons including adjacent intronic regions and approximately 3.6 kb of the 5'-flanking regulatory region. The murine 5-HTT gene is composed of 14 exons spanning approximately 34 kb. The single gene transcript after splicing is 2744 bp in length and it contains 186 bp of 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR) and 668 bp of 3'-UTR. A TATA-like motif and several potential binding sites for transcription factors including AP1, AP2, AP4, SP1 as well as CRE- and GRE-like motifs are present in the GC-rich 5'-flanking region. The characterization of murine 5-HTT cDNA and genomic organization will facilitate studies of 5-HT uptake function with molecular pharmacologic and transgenic strategies as well as investigations of its role in quantitative traits and psychiatric disorders.;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

Herein, we report the targeting ability of metal-phenolic network (MPN)-coated gold nanoparticles with surface-physisorbed antibodies against respective antigens. The MPN coatings were self-assembled from metal ions (FeIII, CoII, CuII, NiII, or ZnII) cross-linked with tannic acid. Upon physisorption of antibodies, all particle systems exhibited enhanced association with target antigens, with CoII systems demonstrating more than 2-fold greater association. These systems contained more metal atoms distributed in a way to specifically interact with antibodies, which were investigated by molecular dynamics simulations. A model antibody fragment crystallizable (Fc) region in solution with CoII-tannic acid complexes revealed that the solvent-exposed CoII can directly coordinate to the histidine-rich portion of the Fc region. This one-pot interaction suggests anchoring of the antibody Fc region to the MPN on nanoparticles, allowing for enhanced targeting.;polyhistidine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
4800;7493923;A novel serine/threonine kinase binding the Ras-related RhoA GTPase which translocates the kinase to peripheral membranes.;We previously reported the cloning of a serine/threonine kinase, PAK (for p21 (Cdc42/Rac)-activated kinase), which binds to the Ras-related GTPases Cdc42Hs and Rac1 (Manser, E., Leung, T., Salihuddin, H., Zhao, Z-s., and Lim, L. (1994) Nature 367, 40-46). These p21 proteins together with RhoA comprise the Rho subfamily of proteins that are involved in morphological events. We now report the isolation of a rat cDNA encoding a 150-kDa protein, which specifically binds RhoA in its GTP form and contains an N-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain highly related to the human myotonic dystrophy kinase and a cysteine-rich domain toward the C terminus. The RhoA binding domain is unrelated to other p21 binding domains. Antibody raised against the kinase domain of the predicted protein, termed ROK alpha (for ROK alpha, RhoA-binding kinase), recognized a ubiquitous 150-kDa protein. The brain p150 purified by affinity chromatography with RhoA exhibited serine/threonine kinase activity. In cultured cells, immunoreactive p150 was recruited to membranes upon transfection with dominant positive RhoAV14 mutant and was localized with actin microfilaments at the cell periphery. These results are consistent with a role for the kinase ROK alpha as an effector for RhoA. ;polycysteine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
4801;6430501;Protamine: a powerful in vivo inhibitor of bone resorption.;Protamine is shown to be a powerful disrupter of calcium homeostasis, acutely inducing a severe hypocalcemia in both rabbits and rats. The magnitude of its effect correlates with bone turnover. Protamine does not significantly alter the renal excretion of calcium, and is effective whether or not there is calcium present in the gut. Protamine causes a significant fall in the specific activity of 45Ca in the blood in animals whose bone has been prelabeled with 45Ca. These data suggest that protamine induces hypocalcemia by blocking calcium efflux from bone. Further work seems indicated to define the biochemical mechanism of this action.;-;-;-;hard_0
4802;2469950;Antigenic sites on the arginine-rich carboxyl-terminal domain of the capsid protein of hepatitis B virus distinct from hepatitis B core or e antigen.;The capsid protein of hepatitis B virus (P19) is made of 183 amino acids and carries the antigenic sites of hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) on the amino-terminal domain. The carboxyl-terminal domain of P19 (amino acids 150-183) is arginine-rich (47%) and faces the interior of the nucleocapsid for the binding with DNA. Monoclonal antibody was raised against an antigenic site on this protamine-like region of P19, which was distinct from HBcAg or HBeAg sites, and the novel antigenic site(s) was provisionally designated as hepatitis B inner core antigen (HBicAg). When P19 in a low concn (150 ng/ml) was immobilized on the solid surface, HBicAg sites were preserved, while HBcAg or HBcAg sites were no longer available on it. This allowed the detection of antibodies against HBicAg (anti-HBic), by sandwiching them between immobilized P19 and anti-IgG labeled with horseradish peroxidase. Anti-HBic was detected in sera from HBsAg carriers, typically those seropositive for antibody to HBeAg. A synthetic arginine-rich decapeptide, with a sequence of Arg-Arg-Arg-Gly-Arg-Ser-Pro-Arg-Arg-Arg, representing amino acids 150-159 of P19 and conserved in the majority of reported hepatitis B virus, absorbed the activity to bind with P19 in seven (44%) out of 16 sera containing anti-HBic. These results indicate that the decapeptide carries an HBicAg epitope and the remaining amino acid sequence of the arginine-rich carboxyl terminal domain (160-183) may be responsible for the other HBicAg epitopes.;polyarginine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
4804;16961312;Characterization by Raman microspectroscopy of the strain-induced conformational transition in fibroin fibers from the silkworm Samia cynthia ricini.;Raman microspectroscopy has been used to quantitatively study the effect of a mechanical deformation on the conformation and orientation of Samia cynthia ricini (S. c. ricini) silk fibroin. Samples were obtained from the aqueous solution stored in the silk gland and stretched at draw ratios (lambda) ranging from 0 to 11. Using an appropriate band decomposition procedure, polarized and orientation-insensitive spectra have been analyzed to determine order parameters and the content of secondary structures, respectively. The data unambiguously show that, in response to mechanical deformation, S. c. ricini fibroin undergoes a cooperative alpha-helix to beta-sheet conformational transition above a critical draw ratio of 4. The alpha-helix content decreases from 33 to 13% when lambda increases from 0 to 11, while the amount of beta-sheets increases from 15 to 37%. In comparison, cocoon silk is devoid of alpha-helical structure and always contains a larger amount of beta-sheets. Although the presence of isosbestic points in different spectral regions reveals that the conformational change induced by mechanical deformation is a two-state process, our results suggest that part of the glycine residues might be incorporated into beta-poly(alanine) structures. The beta-sheets are initially isotropically distributed and orient along the fiber axis as lambda increases, but do not reach the high level of orientation found in the cocoon fiber. The increase in the orientation level of the beta-sheets is found to be concomitant with the alpha --> beta conformational conversion, whereas alpha-helices do not orient under the applied strain but are rather readily converted into beta-sheets. The components assigned to turns exhibit a small orientation perpendicular to the fiber axis in stretched samples, showing that, overall, the polypeptide chains are aligned along the stretching direction. Our results suggest that, in nature, factors other than stretching contribute to the optimization of the amount of beta-sheets and the high degree of orientation found in natural cocoon silk. ;polyalanine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
4805;7107705;Coupling of proadipocyte growth arrest and differentiation. I. Induction by heparinized medium containing human plasma.;The differentiation of proadipocytes in vitro typically required prolonged culture of cells as a high density in high concentrations of serum and added hormones. With such culture conditions it is difficult to design experiments to determine the mechanisms that control the differentiation process. We now describe the rapid and parasynchronous growth arrest and differentiation of low density murine proadipocytes in heparinized medium containing only human plasma. When low density cells are cultured under these conditions, growth arrest at a distinct state in the G1 phase of the cell cycle occurs within 2 d and the differentiation of 80-100% of the cell population occurs within 4 d thereafter. The factors in human plasma which promote growth arrest and differentiation are heat labile and can be separated by barium adsorption. In the following paper we have used these methods to show that there are five separate phases which regulate the coupling of proadipocyte growth arrest and differentiation. The data reported in this paper establish that: (a) high cell density and extensive cell-to-cell contact are not required for adipocyte differentiation, (b) prolonged culture is not required for adipocyte differentiation, and (c) high concentrations of serum and/or added hormones are not required for adipocyte differentiation.;-;-;-;hard_0

Strain was a change in length per unit length in the material of the loaded hoof wall compared with the unloaded condition. Coloured fringes appeared in the photoelastic plastic where there were differences in strain between adjacent sites (strain gradients) in the hoof. Strain distribution was observed in the shod and unshod hoof wall of the front hooves of 6 sound horses with hooves that appeared 'good' to visual inspection, and one unsound horse with hoof cracks. No significant differences in strains were apparent across the hoof walls of the sound horses when the horses were standing normally. Steep strain gradients were apparent in hooves, associated with defects such as cracks, unstable nail holes, and long toes.;-;-;-;hard_0
4809;9016569;Binding site of the M-domain of human protein SRP54 determined by systematic site-directed mutagenesis of signal recognition particle RNA.;The interaction of protein SRP54M from the human signal recognition particle with SRP RNA was studied by systematic site-directed mutagenesis of the RNA molecule. Protein binding sites were identified by the analysis of mutations that removed individual SRP RNA helices or disrupted helical sections in the large SRP domain. The strongest effects on the binding activity of a purified polypeptide that corresponds to the methionine-rich domain of SRP54 (SRP54M) were caused by changes in helix 8 of the SRP RNA. Binding of protein SRP19 was diminished significantly by mutations in helix 6 and was stringently required for SRP54M to associate. Unexpectedly, mutant RNA molecules that resembled bacterial SRP RNAs were incapable of interaction with SRP54M, showing that protein SRP19 has an essential and direct role in the formation of the ternary complex with SRP54 and SRP RNA. Our findings provide an example for how, in eukaryotes, an RNA function has become protein dependent. ;polymethionine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
4813;1445892;FTIR spectroscopic studies of the conformation and amide hydrogen exchange of a peptide model of the hydrophobic transmembrane alpha-helices of membrane proteins.;The conformation and amide hydrogen exchangeability of the hydrophobic peptide Lys2-Gly-Leu24-Lys2-Ala-amide were studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. In these studies information on the secondary structure of the peptide was obtained from an examination of the contours of both the amide I and amide II absorption bands. The conformationally sensitive amide I and amide II regions of the infrared spectra suggest that the peptide is predominantly alpha-helical and that it contains some non-alpha-helical structures which are probably in an extended conformation. Studies of the exchangeability of the amide protons of the peptide indicate that there are two populations of amide protons which differ markedly with respect to their exchangeability with the bulk solvent phase, whether the peptide is dissolved in methanol or dispersed in hydrated lipid bilayers. One population of amide protons is very readily exchangeable, and our data suggest that it arises primarily but not exclusively from the extended regions of the peptide. The other population exchanges very slowly with the bulk solvent and appears to originate entirely from the alpha-helical domain of the peptide. This latter population is virtually unexchangeable when the peptide is dispersed in hydrated phosphatidylcholine bilayers but can be largely exchanged when the peptide is solubilized with methanol. We suggest that this slowly exchanging population of amide protons arises from the central part of the hydrophobic polyleucine core which forms a very stable alpha-helix that would be deeply buried in the hydrophobic domain of hydrated lipid bilayers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS); polyleucine ;helix;-;LCR_with_function

However, no difference in the global liquid consumption between treated and untreated rats during the withdrawal stage was identified. In addition, the hypervascularization of the cortical area observed after chronic alcoholism was significantly decreased in the rats that had received L-NNA during the alcoholism procedure and was comparable to control rats. Thus, L-NNA alters both the behavioral preference for alcohol after alcoholism and the hypermotility during alcohol withdrawal, thus supporting the hypothesis of a direct implication of NO in alcohol abuse and its withdrawal.;-;-;-;hard_0

Whereas the drug was taken up readily, there was relatively little drug in the cytoplasm, but a significant concentration of the drug in the cell nucleus. The EPR signal in the latter site corresponded to a relatively freely rotating radical. The drug exhibited good intracellular stability up to 25 hr. While a delta Tm of 24 degrees between the spin-labeled netropsin and calf thymus DNA confirmed strong binding, the absence of any DNA elongation by viscometry was consistent with nonintercalative exterior binding which was confirmed to be minor groove specific by binding of the agent to T4 DNA with a delta Tm of 17.5 degrees. The sequence specificity of the DNA binding of the spin-labeled drug was confirmed by methidiumpropyl-EDTA (MPE) footprinting on a fragment of pBR322 DNA to be very similar to that of the parent netropsin, i.e. selective for AT-rich sites, with minor differences of protection afforded by introduction of the nitroxide label.;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

4838;33205945;The RNA Polymerase α Subunit Recognizes the DNA Shape of the Upstream Promoter Element.;"We demonstrate here that the α subunit C-terminal domain of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (αCTD) recognizes the upstream promoter (UP) DNA element via its characteristic minor groove shape and electrostatic potential. In two compositionally distinct crystallized assemblies, a pair of αCTD subunits bind in tandem to the UP element consensus A-tract that is 6 bp in length (A6-tract), each with their arginine 265 guanidinium group inserted into the minor groove. The A6-tract minor groove is significantly narrowed in these crystal structures, as well as in computationally predicted structures of free and bound DNA duplexes derived by Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations, respectively. The negative electrostatic potential of free A6-tract DNA is substantially enhanced compared to that of generic DNA. Shortening the A-tract by 1 bp is shown to ""knock out"" binding of the second αCTD through widening of the minor groove. Furthermore, in computationally derived structures with arginine 265 mutated to alanine in either αCTD, either with or without the ""knockout"" DNA mutation, contact with the DNA is perturbed, highlighting the importance of arginine 265 in achieving αCTD-DNA binding. These results demonstrate that the importance of the DNA shape in sequence-dependent recognition of DNA by RNA polymerase is comparable to that of certain transcription factors.";polyalanine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

4844;2442202;Neostriatal projections from cytoarchitectonically defined gyri in the prefrontal cortex of the dog.;The cytoarchitecture and neostriatal projections of the canine prefrontal cortex (PFC) were examined by using Nissl, silver degeneration, autoradiographic, and horseradish peroxidase techniques. Cytoarchitectonically, the PFC can be divided into six major gyral areas with each area corresponding to one of the major gyri--proreal, polar, pregenual, subproreal, paraorbital, and orbital--defined myeloarchitectonically by Kreiner (J. Comp. Neurol. 116:117-133, '61). Of the six major areas, only the proreal gyrus displays a distinctly granular layer IV. In all other gyri, layer IV is more difficult to distinguish. In both the orbital and polar gyri, layer IV is poorly defined and consists of scattered clusters of small cells between layers III and V. In the pregenual, subproreal, and paraorbital gyri, layer IV is not detectable. In all gyri, layer V consists of a thin lamina of small and medium-size pyramidal cells. The transition from layer III to layer V is marked by changes in cell density and size as well as staining intensity. Borders between layers V and VI are generally less distinct than those between layers III and V, with the exception of the pregenual gyrus, in which layer V is separated from layer VI by a distinct cell-poor lamina. In the subproreal and paraorbital gyri, the border between the underlying white matter and layer VI is particularly distinct, with large numbers of neurons oriented tangentially to the white matter. In contrast, the border between layer VI of the orbital gyrus and the white matter is less distinct and consists of palisades of neurons extending well into the white matter. The silver degeneration and autoradiographic methods revealed that prefrontostriatal projections terminate as dorsoventrally oriented longitudinal bands within the medial half of the head and body of the caudate nucleus. Projections from the polar and dorsal proreal gyri terminate most medially in the nucleus while projections from the lateral part of the proreal, subproreal, orbital, and paraorbital gyri terminate progressively more laterally within the medial half of the nucleus. There is apparent overlap between adjacent projection fields. A sparse projection was also noted to a small part of the putamen adjacent to the internal capsule. Injections of horseradish peroxidase into the medial and ventromedial parts of the head of the caudate nucleus resulted in widespread retrograde labeling in parts of the proreal, pregenual, paraorbital, subproreal, and central precruciate gyri.

We report the results of two different methods of PBPC collection for autologous transplantation in 40 patients with stage II or III MM. In group I (n = 18), HD-CY, 4 g/m2 i.v., was administered followed by GM-CSF, 8 microg/kg/day s.c., until the end of collection, starting the leukaphereses after hematological recovery (>1 x 10(9)/l WBC). In group II (n = 22), G-CSF, 10 microg/kg/day s.c., was used alone until the last day of collection, starting consecutive aphereses on the 5th day. A minimum of two aphereses were performed to collect at least 2 x 10(6)/kg CD34+ cells. Both patient groups were comparable for age, sex and clinical prognostic features as well as previous therapies. In group I, the median yields per pheresis were: MNC 1.47 (1.38-2.32) x 10(8)/kg, CFU-GM 0.82 (0.18-13.2) x 10(4)/kg and CD34+ cells 1.98 (0.96-6.96) x 10(6)/kg. In group II these results were: MNC 2.44 (2.06-3.6 x 10(8)/kg) (P = 0.03), CFU-GM 0.75 (0.16-7.8) x 10(4)/kg and CD34+ 1.05 (0.32-3.4) x 10(6)/kg (P = 0.02). The median number of aphereses performed in each group was 5 (4-12) with a median of 5.24 +/- 2.51 in group I and 3 (2-6) with a median of 3.1 (+/- 0.91) in group II (P = NS). Hospitalization for PBPC mobilization was required in all patients in group I and the treatment-related toxicity was greater in this group: 12 patients (66%) developed fever requiring antibiotics during the neutropenic period after HD-CY and six (33%) patients required transfusion support. After receiving busulfan 12 mg/kg p.o. and melphalan 140 mg/m2 i.v., as the conditioning regimen, the median periods to reach granulocytes (>0.5 x 10(9)/l) and platelet (>20 x 10(9)/l) engraftment were 12 and 11 days respectively (ranges 8-20 and 10-16) in group I (HD-CY plus GM-CSF group), and 11 and 13 days respectively (ranges 7-42 and 10-38) in group II (G-CSF group) (P = NS). In conclusion, these data suggest that although HD-CY plus GM-CSF is superior to G-CSF alone based on mean CD34+ cell yield per pheresis, adequate CD34+ cell collections can be achieved with G-CSF alone in most MM patients with less toxicity and with simplification of the procedure.;-;-;-;hard_0

This expression predicts that the rate enhancement is simply the average Boltzmann factor in the region of configurational space where association occurs instantaneously in the diffusion-controlled limit. Based on experimental evidence, this ""transition state"" is defined by configurations in which, relative to the stereospecifically bound complex, the two proteins are shifted apart by approximately 8 A (so a layer of water can be accommodated in the interface) and the two binding surfaces are rotated away by 0 degrees to 3 degrees. The values of the average Boltzmann factor, calculated by solving the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, for the wild-type complex and 16 complexes with single mutations are found to correlate well with experimental results for the electrostatic rate enhancement.

4858;1833647;Drosophila genes Posterior Sex Combs and Suppressor two of zeste encode proteins with homology to the murine bmi-1 oncogene.;The Polycomb group (Pc-G) genes are needed to maintain expression patterns of the homeotic selector genes of the Antennapedia (Antp-C) and bithorax (bx-C) complexes, and hence for the maintenance of segmental determination. We report the predicted protein sequence of the Pc-G gene Posterior Sex Combs (Psc), and of the neighbouring and related gene Suppressor two of zeste (Su(z)2). Both genes encode large proteins that contain a 200 amino-acid domain identical over 37.4% that is also conserved in the murine oncogene bmi-1.

4860;9513895;Catecholamines modulate podocyte function.;The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of adrenoceptor agonists on the intracellular calcium activity ([Ca2+]i), membrane voltage (Vm), and ion conductances (Gm) in differentiated mouse podocytes. [Ca2+]i was measured by the Fura-2 fluorescence method in single podocytes. Noradrenaline and the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine induced a reversible and concentration-dependent biphasic increase of [Ca2+]i in podocytes (EC50 approximately 0.1 microM for peak and plateau), whereas the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist UK 14.304 did not influence [Ca2+]i. The [Ca2+]i response induced by noradrenaline was completely inhibited by the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (10 nM). In a solution with a high extracellular K+ (72.5 mM), [Ca2+]i was unchanged and the [Ca2+]i increase induced by noradrenaline was not inhibited by the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nicardipine (1 microM). Vm and Gm were examined with the patch-clamp technique in the slow whole-cell configuration. Isoproterenol, phenylephrine, and noradrenaline depolarized podocytes and increased Gm. The order of potency for the adrenoceptor agonists was isoproterenol (EC50 approximately 1 nM) > noradrenaline (EC50 approximately 0.3 microM) > phenylephrine (EC50 approximately 0.5 microM). The beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118.551 (5 to 100 nM) inhibited the effect of isoproterenol on Vm. Stimulation of adenylate cyclase by forskolin mimicked the effect of isoproterenol on Vm and Gm (EC50 approximately 40 nM). Isoproterenol induced a time- and concentration-dependent increase of cAMP in podocytes. The effect of isoproterenol was unchanged in the absence of Na+ or in an extracellular solution with a reduced Ca2+ concentration, whereas it was significantly increased in an extracellular solution with a reduced Cl- concentration (from 145 to 32 mM). The data indicate that adrenoceptor agonists regulate podocyte function: They increase [Ca2+]i via an alpha 1-adrenoceptor and induce a depolarization via a beta 2-adrenoceptor. The depolarization is probably due to an opening of a cAMP-dependent Cl- conductance.;-;-;-;hard_0
4861;8609484;RNA-binding activities of barley stripe mosaic virus gamma b fusion proteins.;The barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) gamma-b gene encodes a 17 kDa cysteine-rich protein known to affect virulence and to have a role in regulating viral gene expression. We have constructed recombinant gamma-b-glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in Escherichia coli and have determined the ability of the purified fusion proteins and various mutant derivatives to bind nucleic acids in vitro. Gel-shift analyses revealed that the wild-type gamma-b-fusion protein is able to bind RNA cooperatively. The binding affinity is highly selective for single-stranded RNA because double-stranded RNA, single-stranded and double-stranded DNA, and transfer RNA were unable to compete for binding with the labelled RNA probes. However, BSMV-specific sequence binding was not observed since a chloroplast RNA competed for binding with 32P-labelled transcripts derived from the BSMV genome. The first 44 amino acids of the 152 amino acid gamma-b fusion protein encompassing one of two cysteine-rich 'zinc finger-like' motifs, and a basic region separating the finger-like motifs are required for RNA binding. Site- specific amino acid substitutions within two groups of lysine and arginine residues located in the basic motif reduced the binding affinity of the fusion protein greatly, but cysteine and histidine substitutions designed to disrupt the finger-like motifs failed to have appreciable effects on binding. These findings indicate that the regulatory properties of gamma-b may be mediated in part by RNA binding activities. ;polycysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
4863;7759565;Deletion analysis of minimal sequence requirements for autonomous replication of ors8, a monkey early-replicating DNA sequence.;We have generated a panel of deletion mutants of ors8 (483 bp), a mammalian autonomously replicating DNA sequence, previously isolated by extrusion of nascent monkey (CV-1) DNA from replication bubbles active at the onset of S phase. The deletion mutants were tested for replication function by the DpnI resistance assay, in vivo, after transfection into HeLa cells, and in vitro. An internal fragment of 186-bp that is required for autonomous replication function of ors8 was identified. This fragment, when subcloned into pBR322 and similarly tested, was capable of autonomous replication in vivo and in vitro. The 186-bp fragment contains several repeated sequence motifs, such as the ATTA and ATTTAT motifs, occurring three and five times, respectively, the sequences TAGG and TAGA, occurring three and seven times, respectively, two 5'-ATT-3' repeats, a 44-bp imperfect inverted repeat (IR) sequence, and an imperfect consensus binding element for the transcription factor Oct-1.

We therefore conducted a prospective cohort study involving all the senior rugby clubs in the Scottish Borders. 1169 (96%) of 1216 eligible players provided personal details and recorded all 15-a-side matches they played in the 1993-94 rugby season. Physiotherapists visited the clubs weekly to liaise with volunteer linkmen who were appointed to notify the circumstances of all new or recurrent injuries occurring in matches or rugby-related training. 361 players experienced 584 injuries in 512 injury episodes, 84% of which arose in matches. The period prevalence rate of match injuries was 13.95 (95% CI 12.64-15.26) per 1000 playing hours, the equivalent of an injury episode every 1.8 rugby matches. An injury episode took the player away from the game for an average of 39 days. 28% of injury episodes resulted in absence from employment or school/college work, for an average of 18 days.

The lectin binds sugars LacNAc (K (a) = 1380 M(-1)) and fructose (K (a) = 975 M(-1)), as determined by the fluorescence spectroscopy. It has a single tryptophan per monomer which is exposed on the surface and is in a strong electropositive environment as revealed by quenching with iodide. Quenching of the fluorescence by acrylamide involved both static (K (s) = 0.216 M(-1)) and collisional (K (sv) = 8.19 M(-1)) components. The native protein showed two different lifetimes, tau (1) (1.6 ns) and tau (2) (4.36 ns) which decrease and get converted into a single one, (2.21 ns) after quenching with 0.15 M acrylamide. The bimolecular quenching constant, k ( q ) was 7.55 x 10(11) M(-1) s(-1).

Information on the chemical composition of these grape marc composts is lacking, particularly the variability that may result from different composting practices. In this study, grape marc composts, varying in age from 3 months to 3 years, were collected from four different vineyards and subjected to detailed chemical analysis. The chemical analysis revealed that all the grape marc composts contained levels of free potassium, in the range of 2-3% w/w. Plant macronutrients such as Ca, S, Mg were present at low levels (<1% w/w), while phosphorus (0.1-0.3% w/w) and nitrogen (1-2% w/w) levels were not very high and mainly present in ""plant unavailable"" form. The levels of soluble salts, though not excessive, were elevated in all the composts. These salt levels could cause a problem in some soils. Heavy metals were not present in any significant levels.

4872;8938753;Role of nitric oxide in medullary raphe-evoked inhibition of neuronal activity in the periaqueductal gray matter.;In male urethane-anaesthetized rats, activation of neurons in nucleus raphe obscurus and the caudal tip of nucleus raphe magnus by microinjection of 50-100 nl 0.1 M D,L-homocysteic acid produced a 75.6 +/- 5.2% reduction in the firing rate in 25 neurons in the lateral and dorsolateral sectors of the periaqueductal gray matter which lasted for 102.3 +/- 13.3s (mean +/- S.E.M.). The duration of the inhibition was significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner by intracerebroventricular injection of the inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, N(w)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (50-500 micrograms) but not by N(w)-nitro-D-arginine methyl ester (500 micrograms). In contrast, the magnitude of the raphe-evoked inhibition, i.e. the maximum depression of firing rate, was not significantly affected by either isomer. The results suggest that nitric oxide plays a role in the regulation of the excitability of neurons in the midbrain aversive system by the medullary raphe. The selective effect of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor on the duration, but not the magnitude, of the raphe-evoked inhibition suggests that nitric oxide is not involved in initiating the inhibition. Rather, its role appears to be in maintaining the raphe-evoked inhibition once it has been initiated by a non-nitrergic mechanism.;-;-;-;hard_0
4873;8104088;Degradation fragments of L1 antigen enhance tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurite outgrowth in mesencephalic cell culture.;The L1 antigen has been implicated in adhesion events controlling axonal elongation during formation of major fiber tracts, and promotes neurite outgrowth in culture. It is possible that injury of brain tissue causes neuronal surface molecules such as L1 antigen to be shed, and degradation fragments may therefore be present adjacent to the damage. These L1 fragments might then influence regeneration or injury-induced growth. We have evaluated neurite outgrowth from tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH +) E13 mesencephalic neurons grown in vitro on a substrate of mouse L1 antigen and on L1 degradation fragments separated by molecular weight. Mouse myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), laminin, poly-D-lysine, and fetal calf serum served as control substrates. L1 antibodies were added to one set of cultures (experimental), and compared to control cultures containing normal rabbit serum. After 3 days in vitro, the cultures were stained using an antibody against TH, and the length of the TH + neurites was measured by computer-assisted image analysis in a double-blind fashion. TH+ neurites were significantly longer when grown on L1 antigen, as well as on L1 degradation fragments, as compared to the control substrates. As compared to control normal rabbit serum, L1 antibodies eliminated the neurite-promoting effect of both the L1 substrate and the L1 degradation products. In addition, L1 substrates promoted clustering of TH + cells and the formation of loose bundles of TH + neurites. It is suggested that the L1 substrates influence TH-immunoreactive neurite outgrowth, at least partially, through indirect effects on glial cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS);polyaspartic;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
4875;8080280;Differential inactivation of rabbit and yeast triosephosphate isomerase: effect of oxidations produced by chloramine-T.;Triosephosphate isomerase from rabbit has 5 Cys and 2 Met, while triosephosphate isomerase from yeast has 2 Cys (present in the rabbit enzyme in equivalent positions) and no Met. Since chloramine-T oxidizes Cys and Met, we determined the effect it has on the activity and structure of both enzymes. The activity of triosephosphate isomerase from rabbit was more sensitive to chloramine-T than that of the yeast enzyme (under conditions where the rabbit isomerase was completely inactive, the yeast enzyme exhibited approximately 50% activity). An initial effect of chloramine-T on triosephosphate isomerase was the oxidation of Cys and the formation of catalytically active acidic isoforms. For the yeast isomerase, the two processes were slower. Our data suggest that oxidation of Cys 126, which is conserved in all of the studied species, does not abolish catalysis. Chloramine-T also oxidized the two Met of the rabbit enzyme. At ratios of 50 chloramine-T/monomer, circular dichroism studies showed that the rabbit enzyme, but not that from yeast, underwent extensive alterations of tertiary and secondary structures. This was accompanied by formation of stable dimers, whose cross-linking was not through disulfide bonds. Studies of dimer formation at various enzyme concentrations showed that cross-linking was between monomers of the same dimer. Under conditions that led to cross-linking, rabbit triosephosphate isomerase took up 2.7 mol of 3H from NaB3H4/mol dimer, and the yeast enzyme incorporated only 0.4 mol of 3H. Thus cross-linking was most likely via a Schiff base. The results revealed the points whose modification caused inactivation of the rabbit enzyme.;-;-;-;hard_0

4879;22187158;Human immunodeficiency virus-1 Tat activates NF-κB via physical interaction with IκB-α and p65.;"Nuclear factor (NF)-κB is a master regulator of pro-inflammatory genes and is upregulated in human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection. Mechanisms underlying the NF-κB deregulation by HIV-1 are relevant for immune dysfunction in AIDS. We report that in single round HIV-1 infection, or single-pulse PMA stimulation, the HIV-1 Tat transactivator activated NF-κB by hijacking the inhibitor IκB-α and by preventing the repressor binding to the NF-κB complex. Moreover, Tat associated with the p65 subunit of NF-κB and increased the p65 DNA-binding affinity and transcriptional activity. The arginine- and cysteine-rich domains of Tat were required for IκB-α and p65 association, respectively, and for sustaining the NF-κB activity. Among an array of NF-κB-responsive genes, Tat mostly activated the MIP-1α expression in a p65-dependent manner, and bound to the MIP-1α NF-κB enhancer thus promoting the recruitment of p65 with displacement of IκB-α; similar findings were obtained for the NF-κB-responsive genes CSF3, LTA, NFKBIA and TLR2. Our results support a novel mechanism of NF-κB activation via physical interaction of Tat with IκB-α and p65, and may contribute to further insights into the deregulation of the inflammatory response by HIV-1.

4880;9625366;The effect of surgical treatment on secondary hyperaldosteronism and relative hyperinsulinemia in primary hyperparathyroidism.;"OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the renin-aldosterone system and insulin secretion in hyperparathyroidism and their effects on blood pressure regulation.


DESIGN
Studies were carried out on patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) prior to and following removal of the parathyroid tumor.


METHODS
Sixteen normotensive and euglycemic patients with PHPT were studied. The following parameters were measured: basal and stimulated plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldosterone (ALD) secretion: parathormone (PTH) and serum electrolytes. Insulin and glucose levels were measured during an oral glucose tolerance test.


RESULTS
Systolic but not diastolic blood pressure showed a decrease following surgery, from 123.3+/-13.0/80+/-8.6 to 116.7+/-13.5/77.3+/-8.8 mmHg. The decrease in the systolic pressure was not clinically significant. After surgery, both the basal and stimulated PRA and ALD values decreased, and the preoperative pathological values returned to normal: PRA basal: 1.79 --> 0.70 ng/ml/h, P=0.0049; PRA stimulated: 7.76 --> 1.90 ng/ml/h, P=0.0031; ALD basal: 111.5 --> 73.0 pg/ml, P=0.0258; ALD stimulated: 392.5 --> 236.0 pg/ml, P=0.0157. The postoperative decrease in the PRA correlated with the changes in PTH levels (r=0.5442, P < 0.05, n=16) but did not correlate with the changes in serum calcium concentrations. Both the fasting and stimulated insulin levels decreased after surgery but remained within the normal range: insulin fasting: 10.2 --> 5.0 mIU/l, P=0.0218; insulin area under the curve: 5555 --> 3296 mIU/l*min, P=0.0218. There was no correlation between the changes in insulin levels and PTH or ion levels. Sodium, potassium and blood glucose levels remained unaffected by parathyroid surgery.


CONCLUSIONS
In a population of normotensive hyperparathyroid patients an increased activity of the renin-aldosterone system related to PTH was found and surgery resulted in a small and insignificant decrease in blood pressure. This change was accompanied by a significant decrease in the activity of the renin-aldosterone system indicating the role of the renin-aldosterone system in the regulation of blood pressure in PHPT. Both fasting and stimulated insulin values decreased following removal of the parathyroid tumor, but with no individual correlation with PTH and calcium levels.";-;-;-;hard_0
4884;9860983;Mouse deformed epidermal autoregulatory factor 1 recruits a LIM domain factor, LMO-4, and CLIM coregulators.;Nuclear LIM domains interact with a family of coregulators referred to as Clim/Ldb/Nli. Although one family member, Clim-2/Ldb-1/Nli, is highly expressed in epidermal keratinocytes, no nuclear LIM domain factor is known to be expressed in epidermis. Therefore, we used the conserved LIM-interaction domain of Clim coregulators to screen for LIM domain factors in adult and embryonic mouse skin expression libraries and isolated a factor that is highly homologous to the previously described LIM-only proteins LMO-1, -2, and -3. This factor, referred to as LMO-4, is expressed in overlapping manner with Clim-2 in epidermis and in several other regions, including epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal, respiratory and genitourinary tracts, developing cartilage, pituitary gland, and discrete regions of the central and peripheral nervous system. Like LMO-2, LMO-4 interacts strongly with Clim factors via its LIM domain. Because LMO/Clim complexes are thought to regulate gene expression by associating with DNA-binding proteins, we used LMO-4 as a bait to screen for such DNA-binding proteins in epidermis and isolated the mouse homologue of Drosophila Deformed epidermal autoregulatory factor 1 (DEAF-1), a DNA-binding protein that interacts with regulatory sequences first described in the Deformed epidermal autoregulatory element. The interaction between LMO-4 and mouse DEAF-1 maps to a proline-rich C-terminal domain of mouse DEAF-1, distinct from the helix-loop-helix and GATA domains previously shown to interact with LMOs, thus defining an additional LIM-interacting domain. ;polyproline;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Because uterine leiomyomata can form when ovariectomized guinea pigs are exposed to estradiol and retinoic acids, we tested whether human leiomyomata had high levels of retinoic acids and related nuclear receptors. Compared with normal human myometrium, leiomyomata had 3- to 5-fold higher levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), retinoid X receptor alpha proteins, and all-trans retinoic acid, but only during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. 9-cis Retinoic acid was undetectable in either leiomyomata or myometrium. PPARgamma mRNA levels were lower in leiomyomata than myometrium, but only during the luteal phase of the cycle. A PPARgamma agonist, troglitazone, was given to guinea pigs along with estradiol and all-trans retinoic acid and produced the largest leiomyomata seen to date in this model. By contrast, no tumors formed when troglitazone was given alone or with estradiol or when troglitazone was given with estradiol and 9-cis retinoic acid.

Using microinjection of recombinant plasmids into fertilized frog eggs, we have shown that a 14 base pair CT-rich sequence element, normally located about 700 bases upstream of the GS17 promoter, is sufficient to activate transcription of a heterologous reporter gene in gastrula stage embryos. This regulatory element has been called the OZ sequence. Sequences closely related to OZ are located in the promoter regions of several other genes expressed during Xenopus development. Extracts prepared from Xenopus embryos show the presence of a DNA-binding factor, OZ-1, that specifically recognizes the OZ sequence. Mutations within the OZ element that abolish OZ-1 binding also abolish enhancer activity. The OZ-1 factor contains at least two proteins of approximate M(r) 76 x 10(3) and 100 x 10(3). The sequence-specific binding activity accumulates during oogenesis and remains present at approximately constant levels throughout early development. ;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

The study of macrophage gene function and regulation as well as its potential therapeutic intervention will require the development of vectors capable of safe and efficient transfer of DNA to the AM. In the present study, we report a new transfection system that utilizes Fc receptor-mediated endocytosis as a means to target DNA to the AM. This system employs molecular conjugates consisting of a cognate moiety, in this case IgG which recognizes the AM Fc receptor, covalently-linked to a DNA-binding moiety, such as a cationic polyamine. A Complex was formed between immunoglobulin G-polylysine conjugate (IgG-pL) and plasmid DNA carrying the LacZ reporter gene (pSV beta). The conjugate-DNA complex was added directly to the AMs in culture and incubated for 24 h, after which LacZ gene expression was analyzed for beta-galactosidase activity by microfluorometry using a fluorogenic beta-galactosidase substrate, 5-dodecanoylaminofluorescein di-beta-D-galactopyranoside (C12FDG). The AMs treated with the IgG-pL/DNA complex exhibited galactosidase activity significantly augmented over background levels. Effective gene transfer was shown to require both the DNA-binding moiety and cognate moiety for the cell surface receptor. Specific internalization of the complex by the Fc receptor pathway was verified by competitive inhibition using excess IgG. Under this condition, LacZ gene expression was inhibited, suggesting complex internalization through the Fc mediated endocytosis pathway. The requirement of Fc receptors for complex internalization was further demonstrated using cells that lack Fc receptors, e.g., alveolar epithelial cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS);polylysine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Our aim was to characterize autonomic dysfunction in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) using heart rate variability (HRV) studies.


METHODS
EKG signals were obtained from 35 patients (mean age, 39.1 +/- 9.5 yr, M:F ratio = 2.9:1) and 18 healthy controls (mean age, 38.2 +/- 6.5 yr, M:F ratio = 2:1) in supine, standing, and deep-breathing modes. Fast Fourier transformation and autoregressive techniques were used to analyze the HRV power spectra in very low (VLF, 0.0078-0.04 Hz), low (LF, 0.04-0.14 Hz), and high (HF, 0.14-0.4 Hz) frequency bands.


RESULTS
In the supine position, the VLF power spectral density (PSD) in IBS was significantly higher than normal (3 vs 1.3 beats per minute [bpm]2/Hz, p < 0.01). On changing from the supine to standing position, the normals (NC) had raised median PSDs in the VLF (1.3 vs 12.8 bpm2/Hz, p < 0.01) and LF (1.6 vs 6.1 bpm2/Hz, p < 0.01) bands, as a sign of increased sympathetic tone, whereas the median HF PSDs (parasympathetic tone) remained unchanged (1.8 bpm2/Hz each, p = 0.8). Similarly, the IBS patients had increased VLF (3.04 vs 14.93 bpm2/Hz, p < 0.01) and LF (2.8 vs 8.7 bpm2/Hz, p < 0.01) PSDs on standing up, but the HF PSD was also raised (from 2.4 to 5.7 bpm2/Hz, p = 0.04). On changing from standing to the deep-breathing mode, the normals had a significant increase in the HF (from 1.8 to 10.3 bpm2/Hz, p < 0.001) and a significant reduction of the VLF (from 12.8 to 2.2 bpm2/Hz, p < 0.01) PSDs. The reduction of the LF PSD was not significant (from 6.1 to 5.6 bpm2/Hz, p = 0.6). In IBS, HF PSD remained constant (5.7 bpm2/Hz each, p = 0.6), whereas the LF PSD increased from 8.7 to 24.2 bpm2/Hz (p < 0.0001). The VLF PSD was reduced (from 14.9 to 4.1 bpm2/Hz, p < 0.0001). In IBS, the median sympathovagal outflow ratio was significantly lower in the standing position (1.4 vs 2.8, p < 0.02) and higher in the deep-breathing mode (7.33 vs 0.42, p < 0.0001) than normal.

To evaluate the results of the treatment of lymphoedema by intra-arterial infusion of autologous lymphocytes.


DESIGN
Open study.


SETTING
University Hospital.


SUBJECTS
13 patients with refractory lymphoedema.


INTERVENTIONS
Lymphocytes were separated from the patient's own blood using a blood cell separator; about 100 cc of lymphocyte dominant blood separated from this blood was immediately infused into the proximal artery of the affected limb. Infusion was practiced once a week, and repeated 4 to 6 times.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Change in size of the affected limb (defined as the difference between the affected limb and the normal limb after treatment), and softening of the edema (measured with a tension gauge).


RESULTS
In all 13 patients there was softening of the affected hard limb followed by a reduction in the size of the limb (mean 64%), and the ache and sensation of heat in the limb lessened.

4911;10097097;Alanine is helix-stabilizing in both template-nucleated and standard peptide helices.;"Alanine-based peptides of defined sequence and length show measurable helix contents, allowing them to be used as a model system both for analyzing the mechanism of helix formation and for investigating the contributions of side-chain interactions to protein stability. Extensive characterization of many peptide sequences with varying amino acid contents indicates that the favorable helicity of alanine-based peptides can be attributed to the large helix-stabilizing propensity of alanine. Based on their analysis of alanine-rich sequences N-terminally linked to a synthetic helix-inducing template, Kemp and coworkers [Kemp, D. S., Boyd, J. G. & Muendel, C. C. (1991) Nature (London) 352, 451-454; Kemp, D. S., Oslick, S. L. & Allen, T. J. (1996) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 118, 4249-4255] argue that alanine is helix-indifferent, however, and that the favorable helix contents of alanine-based peptides must have some other explanation. Here, we show that the helix contents of template-nucleated sequences are influenced strongly by properties of the template-helix junction. A model in which the helix propensities of residues at the template-peptide junction are treated separately brings the results from alanine-based peptides and template-nucleated helices into agreement. The resulting model provides a physically plausible resolution of the discrepancies between the two systems and allows the helix contents of both template-nucleated and standard peptide helices to be predicted by using a single set of helix propensities. Helix formation in both standard peptides and template-peptide conjugates can be attributed to the large intrinsic helix-forming tendency of alanine."; polyalanine ;helix;-;LCR_with_function
4915;9710581;Regulation of alternative polyadenylation by U1 snRNPs and SRp20.;Although considerable information is currently available about the factors involved in constitutive vertebrate polyadenylation, the factors and mechanisms involved in facilitating communication between polyadenylation and splicing are largely unknown. Even less is known about the regulation of polyadenylation in genes in which 3'-terminal exons are alternatively recognized. Here we demonstrate that an SR protein, SRp20, affects recognition of an alternative 3'-terminal exon via an effect on the efficiency of binding of a polyadenylation factor to an alternative polyadenylation site. The gene under study codes for the peptides calcitonin and calcitonin gene-related peptide. Its pre-mRNA is alternatively processed by the tissue-specific inclusion or exclusion of an embedded 3'-terminal exon, exon 4, via factors binding to an intronic enhancer element that contains both 3' and 5' splice site consensus sequence elements. In cell types that preferentially exclude exon 4, addition of wild-type SRp20 enhances exon 4 inclusion via recognition of the intronic enhancer. In contrast, in cell types that preferentially include exon 4, addition of a mutant form of SRp20 containing the RNA-binding domain but missing the SR domain inhibits exon 4 inclusion. Inhibition is likely at the level of polyadenylation, because the mutant SRp20 inhibits binding of CstF to the exon 4 poly(A) site. This is the first demonstration that an SR protein can influence alternative polyadenylation and suggests that this family of proteins may play a role in recognition of 3'-terminal exons and perhaps in the communication between polyadenylation and splicing.; polyalanine ;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

It was shown that a total population of bone marrow cells did not differ from that of cultured L5178Y cells with regard to the yield of single-strand breaks and the ratio between double- and single-strand breaks. The absence of double-strand breaks and incomplete repair of single-strand breaks (70%) were noted with doses ranging from 20 to 100 Gy. The quantity of unrepaired single-strand breaks did not correlate with that of double-strand breaks, induced by the same radiation doses. This is indicative of the capacity of bone marrow cells for repair in a short-term culture.;-;-;-;hard_0
4918;6507393;The role of host factors in an outbreak of necrotizing enterocolitis.;During an outbreak investigation of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in a neonatal intensive care unit, we identified nine definite and six suspected cases of NEC on the basis of histopathologic, clinical, and roentgenographic findings. Neonates of low birth weight (less than 1,250 g) had the highest incidence of NEC, supporting a role for prematurity in this disease. Patients with definite NEC and those with severe clinical features had significantly lower birth weights and postconception ages (gestational age at birth plus postnatal age at onset of NEC) than the patients with suspected NEC. In a case-control study using birth weight-matched control subjects, maternal toxemia was identified as a possible protective factor for NEC. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the relationship between NEC disease severity and postconception age. These findings also suggest that toxemia may be an important protective factor in NEC and should be examined in subsequent studies.;-;-;-;hard_0
4919;9497316;MgcRacGAP, a new human GTPase-activating protein for Rac and Cdc42 similar to Drosophila rotundRacGAP gene product, is expressed in male germ cells.;In a search for new partners of the activated form of Rac GTPase, we have isolated through a two-hybrid cloning procedure a human cDNA encoding a new GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rho family GTPases. A specific mRNA of 3.2 kilobases was detected in low abundance in many cell types and found highly expressed in testis. A protein of the predicted size 58 kDa, which we call MgcRacGAP, was detected in human testis as well as in germ cell tumor extracts by immunoblotting with antibodies specific to recombinant protein. In vitro, the GAP domain of MgcRacGAP strongly stimulates Rac1 and Cdc42 GTPase activity but is almost inactive on RhoA. N-terminal to its GAP domain, MgcRacGAP contains a cysteine-rich zinc finger-like motif characteristic of the Chimaerin family of RhoGAPs. The closest homolog of MgcRacGAP is RotundRacGAP, a product of the Drosophila rotund locus. In situ hybridization experiments in human testis demonstrate a specific expression of mgcRacGAP mRNA in spermatocytes similar to that of rotundRacGAP in Drosophila testis. Therefore, protein sequence similarity and analogous developmental and tissue specificities of gene expression support the hypothesis that RotundRacGAP and MgcRacGAP have equivalent functions in insect and mammalian germ cells. Since rotundRacGAP deletion leads to male sterility in the fruit fly, the mgcRacGAP gene may prove likewise to play a key role in mammalian male fertility. ;polycysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
4920;6793314;Transcutaneous PCO2 monitoring on adult patients in the ICU and the operating room.;Studies were performed on 44 patients who were monitored continuously with transcutaneous carbon dioxide (PtcCO2) sensors. The patients were monitored intermittently with arterial and mixed venous blood gases and full hemodynamic and oxygen transport data. Twenty of the studies were performed intraoperatively. A total of 411 data sets revealed a correlation coefficient, r, between arterial and transcutaneous PCO2 of 0.80 when the patients were not in low flow shock, i.e., cardiac index (CI) greater than 1.5 L/min x M2. On the basis of these data, the authors have found the normal arterial-transcutaneous carbon dioxide gradient, delta CO2, (delta CO2 = PtcCO2 -- PaCO2) to be 23 +/- 11 torr. The PtcCO2 monitor was found to be a valuable trend monitor of arterial CO2 tensions of adults during adequate cardiac function in the ICU and the operating room. Twenty-four data sets were collected while 3 patients were monitored during severe shock (CI less than 1.5 L/min x M2). PtcCO2 trended inversely with changes in CI during shock and did not follow PaCO2 (r = --0.85). During shock, delta CO2 = 61 %/- 25 torr. The severity of shock could be roughly determined by comparing the PtcCO2 values with arterial CO2 tensions.;-;-;-;hard_0
4921;19726719;Glycoprotein Ibalpha inhibitor complex structure reveals a combined steric and allosteric mechanism of von Willebrand factor antagonism.;Platelet glycoprotein Ibalpha (GpIbalpha) interactions with von Willebrand factor (VWF) are a critical early event in platelet adhesion, which contributes to hemostasis and thrombosis. Here we report the structure of a complex between GpIbalpha and a potent peptide inhibitor. The cyclic peptide (CTERMALHNLC) was isolated from a cysteine-constrained phage display library, and in the complex this forms one and a half turns of an amphipathic alpha-helix, the curvature of which facilitates contacts with the curved concave face of the GpIbalpha leucine-rich repeats. The peptide has only limited overlap with the VWF binding site. It effectively inhibits by stabilizing an alternative alpha-helical conformation of a regulatory loop that forms an extended beta-hairpin upon VWF binding. The structure defines a previously unrecognized binding site within GpIbalpha and represents a clear strategy for developing antiplatelet agents targeting the GpIbalpha-VWF interaction allosterically. ;polyleucine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
4922;3379635;Structural organization of the mouse mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase gene.;Structural organization of the mouse mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37) gene was determined by analyzing a genomic DNA fragment isolated from a cosmid library. The gene is 12,000 base-pairs long and contains nine exons interrupted by eight introns of various sizes. The 5' and 3'-flanking regions, and the exact sizes and boundaries of the exon blocks including the transcription-initiation sites were determined. In the 5'-flanking region, there is neither a TATA box nor a CAAT box. Instead of these sequences, there are six copies of the GGGCGG or CCGCCC sequence, which is a potential binding site for the transcription factor, Sp1. The 5'-flanking region up to about 600 nucleotides is G + C-rich (65%) and contains sequences compatible with the formation of a number of potentially stable stem-loop structures. S1 nuclease mapping and primer extension analysis demonstrated that transcription of the mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase gene initiates at multiple sites. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the promoter region of the mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase gene with that of the mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase gene, revealed that there are several highly conserved regions between these two mitochondrial enzyme genes participating in the malate-aspartate shuttle.;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

While nearly all of these discoveries were made using unfixed, snap-frozen materials, with few exceptions, clinical biopsy materials are comprised of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues.

4933;8654390;cDNA cloning of a novel protein containing two zinc-finger domains that may function as a transcription factor for the human heme-oxygenase-1 gene.;"Heme oxygenase 1 is an essential enzyme in heme catabolism that cleaves heme to form biliverdin, iron, and carbon monoxide. The human heme-oxygenase-1 gene is transcriptionally activated through the cis-regulatory element (MTE), GTCATATGAC (positions -156 to -147), during 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA)-induced differentiation of myelomonocytic cell lines, such as THP-1, to macrophages. MTE is responsible for the myelomonocytic-specific induction of heme-oxygenase-1 gene expression, and is bound by ubiquitous and myelomonocytic cell-line-restricted proteins. In this study, we cloned the cDNA segments coding for a portion of a protein that binds to MTE by a Southwestern procedure from a THP-1 cDNA expression library; we subsequently isolated putative full-length cDNAs by a conventional hybridization procedure. The deduced protein, termed MTB-Zf, consists of 1482 amino acid residues, has a molecular mass of about 162 kDa, and contains the two widely separated zinc-finger domains located near the N- and C-termini. MTB-Zf possesses other structural features characteristic of transcription factors, including a long stretch of acidic amino acids (amino acids 67 - 95), a proline-rich region (positions 733-849), a region rich in basic amino acids (positions 1161-1247), and a leucine repeat-like region (positions 486-514). We show that a portion of MTB-Zf, including an N-terminal zinc-finger domain, binds in vitro to MTE and that the transient coexpression of MTB-Zf cDNA leads to transactivation of the heme-oxygenase-1 gene promoter. Since the 6.5 kb MTB-Zf is expressed in various human cell lines of different lineages, MTB-Zf may represent a ubiquitous MTE-binding protein. Furthermore, the MTB-Zf gene has been mapped to human chromosome 1p35-36.1 by fluorescence in situ hybridization, a region which is frequently deleted in various solid tumors, including neurogenic tumors. We found remarkable differences in the expression patterns of MTB-Zf mRNA and two other hybridizable mRNAs of 5kb and 8.5 kb when human brain and primary brain tumors were compared. Both MTB-Zf and the 8.5-kb mRNAs were abundantly expressed in the five primary brain tumors examined, but only the 5-kb mRNA was detectable in the human brain. These results suggest that MTB-Zf is a transcription factor and may also play an important role in cell growth or differentiation.";polyproline;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
4936;9335556;The Escherichia coli FOF1 gammaM23K uncoupling mutant has a higher K0.5 for Pi. Transition state analysis of this mutant and others reveals that synthesis and hydrolysis utilize the same kinetic pathway.;The Escherichia coli FOF1 ATP synthase uncoupling mutation, gammaM23K, was found to increase the energy of interaction between gamma and beta subunits, prevent the proper utilization of binding energy to drive catalysis, and block the enzyme in a Pi release mode. In this paper, the effects of this mutation on substrate binding in cooperative ATP synthesis are assessed. Activation of ATP synthesis by ADP and Pi was determined for the gammaM23K FOF1. The K0.5 for ADP was not affected, but K0.5 for Pi was approximately 7-fold higher even though the apparent Vmax was close to the wild-type level. Wild-type enzyme had a turnover number of 82 s-1 at pH 7.5 and 30 degrees C. During oxidative phosphorylation, the apparent dissociation constant (KI) for ATP was not affected and was 5-6 mM for both wild-type and gammaM23K enzymes. Thus, the apparent binding affinity for ATP in the presence of DeltamuH+ was lowered by 7 orders of magnitude from the affinity measured at the high-affinity catalytic site. Arrhenius analysis of ATP synthesis for the gammaM23K FOF1 revealed that, like those of ATP hydrolysis, the transition state DeltaH was much more positive and TDeltaS was much less negative, adding up to little change in DeltaG. These results suggested that ATP synthesis is inefficient because of an extra bond between gamma and beta subunits which must be broken to achieve the transition state. Analysis of the transition state structures using isokinetic plots demonstrate that ATP hydrolysis and synthesis utilize the same kinetic pathway. Incorporating this information into a model for rotational catalysis suggests that at saturating substrate concentrations, the rate-limiting step for hydrolysis and synthesis is the rotational power stroke where each of the beta subunits changes conformation and affinity for nucleotide.;-;-;-;hard_0
4937;26468056;Neutrophil extracellular traps cause airway obstruction during respiratory syncytial virus disease.;"Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important cause of severe lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) in young children worldwide. Extensive neutrophil accumulation in the lungs and occlusion of small airways by DNA-rich mucus plugs are characteristic features of severe RSV-LRTD. Activated neutrophils can release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), extracellular networks of DNA covered with antimicrobial proteins, as part of the first-line defence against pathogens. NETs can trap and eliminate microbes; however, abundant NET formation may also contribute to airway occlusion. In this study, we investigated whether NETs are induced by RSV and explored their potential anti-viral effect in vitro. Second, we studied NET formation in vivo during severe RSV-LRTD in infants and bovine RSV-LRTD in calves, by examining bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue sections, respectively. NETs were visualized in lung cytology and tissue samples by DNA and immunostaining, using antibodies against citrullinated histone H3, elastase and myeloperoxidase. RSV was able to induce NET formation by human neutrophils in vitro. Furthermore, NETs were able to capture RSV, thereby precluding binding of viral particles to target cells and preventing infection. Evidence for the formation of NETs in the airways and lungs was confirmed in children with severe RSV-LRTD. Detailed histopathological examination of calves with RSV-LRTD showed extensive NET formation in dense plugs occluding the airways, either with or without captured viral antigen. Together, these results suggest that, although NETs trap viral particles, their exaggerated formation during severe RSV-LRTD contributes to airway obstruction.

MCPG (20.8 micrograms) injected intraventricularly (i.c.v.) before testing impaired the performance of rats in the spatial version of the Morris water maze, but 1/10 of this dose did not. Memory retention, evaluated 24 hr post-training, was also affected by the high dose of MCPG. However, performance in a cued version of the water maze was not impaired by the high dose, excluding effects of the drug on perceptual faculties. The effects of the MCPG were further characterized on performance in another hippocampus-dependent spatial learning task, the context-dependent fear conditioning task. MCPG (20.8 micrograms, i.c.v.) did not interfere with conditioned freezing to context in this task. For comparison, a group of rats was injected with the NMDA receptor blocker MK801. MK801 at a dose that disrupted the performance in the spatial version of the Morris water maze (0.08 mg/kg), significantly reduced freezing compared to controls. These experiments indicate that MCPG-sensitive metabotropic receptors may be required for only a restricted subset of spatial learning tasks, while NMDA receptors may play an integral role in all spatial learning.;-;-;-;hard_0

A schematic model for the three epitopes is presented. Antibodies directed against 2-5A, in conjunction with other techniques, were employed to quantify 2-5A in various tissues of pathogen-free mice. Levels of 2-5A were in the range of 400-800 fmole/gm. Mice injected with poly(I).poly(c) or encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) showed elevated levels of 2-5A. Administration of poly(I).poly(C) or EMCV increased the level of 2-5A in different tissues to different extents. Raman spectroscopy was employed to explore the conformation of 2-5A. Distinct differences were observed in bands arising from the backbone portion of 2-5A relative to those of 3-5A. The most striking finding was the appearance of a strong, sharp band at 1460 cm-1 in spectra of 5'-monophosphorylated 2-5A's. This band was barely detectable in core and triphosphorylated 2-5A. Its presence suggests that 5'-monophosphorylated 2-5A's possess a unique conformational feature that distinguish them from cores and 5'-triphosphorylated forms.;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
4944;6433719;Role of calcium ions in insulin action on hexose transport in L6 muscle cells.;"It has been proposed that Ca2+ ions mediate the stimulation by insulin of glucose uptake in muscle (Clausen, T., Cell Calcium 1:311-325, 1980). However, absolute measurements of the concentration of cytosolic free Ca2+, [Ca2+]i, during the course of insulin action have not been made. The stimulation of hexose uptake by insulin was studied in an in vitro model system of muscle cells, the L6 cell line. The following evidence suggests that Ca2+ ions are not likely to fulfill the purported role. 1) Insulin in Ca2+-free media induced stimulation of 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake. 2) Elevation of [Ca2+]i with the ionophore A23187 did not enhance hexose uptake. 3) Insulin action was not diminished when the hormone was added to Ca2+-depleted cells in Ca2+-free media with A23187. 4) Hexose uptake was not affected by a number of agents thought to modify [Ca2+]i including epinephrine, caffeine, 2,4-dinitrophenol, hyperosmolar mannitol, salicylate, vanadate, veratrine, and trypsin. 5) Direct determinations of [Ca2+]i by fluorescence of the novel indicator Quin-2 did not show differences between basal and insulin-stimulated cells; under identical conditions hexose uptake was stimulated by the hormone. 6) Chelation of [Ca2+]i with Quin-2 in Ca2+-free media did not affect the response to insulin. 7) Low concentrations of trypsin (7.5 micrograms/ml) elevated [Ca2+]i but did not increase the rate of hexose uptake.";-;-;-;hard_0

The promoter region of ETS2 does not possess typical ""TATA"" and ""CAAT"" elements. However, this promoter contains several repeat regions, as well as two consensus AP2 binding sites and three putative Sp1 sites. There is also a palindromic region similar to the serum response element of the c-fos gene, located 1400 base pairs (bp) upstream from the first major transcription initiation site. A G + C-rich sequence (GC element) with dyad symmetry can be seen in the ETS2 promoter, immediately following an unusually long (approximately 250-bp) polypurine-polypyrimidine tract. A series of deletion fragments from the putative promoter region were ligated in front of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene and tested for activity following transfection into HeLa cells. The 5' boundary of the region needed for maximum promoter activity was found to be 159 bp upstream of the major initiation site. This region of 159 bp contains putative binding sites for transcription factors Sp1 and AP2 (one for each), the GC element, one small forward repeat, one inverted repeat, and half of the polypurine-pyrimidine tract.

The hnRNP U protein is an abundant nucleoplasmic phosphoprotein that is the largest of the major hnRNP proteins (120 kDa by SDS-PAGE). HnRNP U binds pre-mRNA in vivo and binds both RNA and ssDNA in vitro. Here we describe the cloning and sequencing of a cDNA encoding the hnRNP U protein, the determination of its amino acid sequence and the delineation of a region in this protein that confers RNA binding. The predicted amino acid sequence of hnRNP U contains 806 amino acids (88,939 Daltons), and shows no extensive homology to any known proteins. The N-terminus is rich in acidic residues and the C-terminus is glycine-rich. In addition, a glutamine-rich stretch, a putative NTP binding site and a putative nuclear localization signal are present. It could not be defined from the sequence what segment of the protein confers its RNA binding activity. We identified an RNA binding activity within the C-terminal glycine-rich 112 amino acids. This region, designated U protein glycine-rich RNA binding region (U-gly), can by itself bind RNA. Furthermore, fusion of U-gly to a heterologous bacterial protein (maltose binding protein) converts this fusion protein into an RNA binding protein. A 26 amino acid peptide within U-gly is necessary for the RNA binding activity of the U protein. Interestingly, this peptide contains a cluster of RGG repeats with characteristic spacing and this motif is found also in several other RNA binding proteins. We have termed this region the RGG box and propose that it is an RNA binding motif and a predictor of RNA binding activity.;polyglutamine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Three doses of BPA 700, 1000 and 1600 mg kg(-1) were used to establish the biodistribution of boron-10 (10B) in blood, spinal cord and brain over a 3-h period after intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration. At the lowest dose of BPA used, blood 10B levels remained relatively stable over the 3-h sampling period. With the two higher doses of BPA, blood 10B concentrations were greatest at 1 h after BPA administration, and thereafter exhibited a biphasic clearance profile. The largest decline in blood 10B levels occurred between 1 and 2 h after i.p. injection and was most pronounced (approximately 45%) in the highest BPA dose group. Considered overall, 10B concentrations were marginally lower in the spinal cord than in the brain. Levels of 10B in both of these organs showed a slow but progressive increase with time after administration of BPA. The 10B concentration ratio for blood relative to CNS tissue increased with BPA dosage and reached a peak value of approximately 10:1 in the highest BPA dose group, at 1 h after i.p. injection. However, at 3 h after injection the 10B concentration ratios had decreased to approximately 3:1 in all of the BPA dose groups. After irradiation with thermal neutrons in combination with BPA at blood 10B concentrations of approximately 42 and approximately 93 microg g(-1), myelopathy developed after latent intervals of 20.0 +/- 0.6 and 20.0 +/- 1.2 weeks respectively. ED50 values (+/- s.e.) for the incidence of myelopathy were calculated from probit-fitted curves, and were 17.5 +/- 0.7 and 25.0 +/- 0.6 Gy after irradiation with thermal neutrons at blood 10B levels of approximately 42 and approximately 93 microg g(-1) respectively. The compound biological effectiveness (CBE) factor values, estimated from these data, were 0.67 +/- 0.23 and 0.48 +/- 0.18 respectively. This compared with a previous estimate of 0.88 +/- 0.14 at a blood 10B concentration of approximately 19 microg g(-1). It was concluded that the value of the CBE factor was not influenced by the level of 10B in the blood, but by the blood:CNS 10B concentration ratio. In effect, the CBE factor decreases as the concentration ratio increases. Simulations using boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) treatment planning software indicate a significant therapeutic advantage could be obtained in moving to higher BPA doses than those in current clinical use.;-;-;-;hard_0

The amino acid sequence homology search also reveals that STAP is identical to a mouse oxidative stress protein, A170, and has 90% homology with a human p62 protein that binds to the tyrosine kinase p56(lck) SH2 domain. Northern blot analysis indicated a broad expression profile of STAP mRNA in various tissues and cell lines. In MC3T3-E1 cells, STAP mRNA was induced by treatment with TGF-beta, but not with BMP-2 or GDF-5. Analysis of the mouse STAP gene isolated from the genomic library revealed that the STAP gene spans a region of over 11 kb and comprises eight exons. The transcription start site was identified by primer extension analysis to be located 35 bp upstream from the translation initiation site. Sequencing analysis of the 5' flanking region of the STAP gene revealed multiple consensus motifs/sequences for several DNA binding transcription factors. The STAP gene had a TATA box, but no CCAAT box.

Thus false-positive ANCA, as defined by absence of vasculitis, was found in 5% of dialysis patients versus 0% in patients with preterminal renal failure (n = 152) or blood donors (n = 150). Patients with vasculitis tended to have higher c-ANCA and p-ANCA titres respectively, but there was a considerable overlap. Titres were not higher in patients symptomatic at the time of examination (6 of 11 c-ANCA and 10 of 19 p-ANCA), but PR-3 and MPO ELISA were positive in all but two.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)";-;-;-;hard_0
4958;8392380;Parathyroid hormone-like peptide and parathyroid hormone are secreted from bovine parathyroid via different pathways.;Parathyroid hormone-like peptide is a recently discovered protein which is thought to be responsible for the hypercalcemia of malignancy. Through the use of radioimmunoassay, Northern analysis and Western blot techniques this protein has been demonstrated to occur in a variety of tumor and normal cells. Its role in normal physiology is not established nor is there knowledge regarding its synthesis, secretion, and storage. We have investigated characteristics of the secretion of parathyroid hormone-like peptide in bovine parathyroid gland slices and cells to learn whether or not this protein is secreted in a manner similar to that of parathyroid hormone. We have used radioimmunoassays specific for PTH and PTH-rP to measure the secretion of each protein and have found that, unlike PTH, PTH-rP secretion was not influenced by the medium calcium concentration. Similarly, PTH-rP secretion was not influenced by other known PTH secretagogues such as c-AMP or isoproterenol. An examination of the subcellular distribution of PTH-rP revealed that 75-90% of it occurs in the soluble fraction of cell lysates. Analysis of isolated secretory granules demonstrated the presence of PTH while PTH-rP was undetectable in these organelles. We conclude that PTH-rP is not secreted from parathyroid cells via the regulated pathway utilizing PTH secretory granules.;-;-;-;hard_0

4960;12482655;Recovery of paramyxovirus simian virus 5 with a V protein lacking the conserved cysteine-rich domain: the multifunctional V protein blocks both interferon-beta induction and interferon signaling.;The V protein of the Paramyxovirus simian virus 5 (SV5) is a multifunctional protein containing an N-terminal 164 residue domain that is shared with the P protein and a distinct C-terminal domain that is cysteine-rich and which is highly conserved among Paramyxoviruses. We report the recovery from Vero cells [interferon (IFN) nonproducing cells] of a recombinant SV5 (rSV5) that lacks the V protein C-terminal specific domain (rSV5VDeltaC). In Vero cells rSV5VDeltaC forms large plaques and grows at a rate and titer similar to those of rSV5. In BHK or CV-1 cells rSV5VDeltaC forms small plaques and grows poorly. However, even when grown in Vero cells rSV5VDeltaC reverts to pseudo-wild-type virus in four to five passages, indicating the importance of the V protein for successful replication of SV5. Whereas rSV5 grows in many cell types with minimal cytopathic effect (CPE), rSV5VDeltaC causes extensive CPE in the same cell types. To overcome the antiviral state induced by IFN, many viruses have evolved mechanisms to counteract the effects of IFN by blocking the production of IFN and abrogating IFN signaling. Whereas rSV5 blocks IFN signaling by mediating the degradation of STAT1, rSV5VDeltaC does not cause the degradation of STAT1 and IFN signaling occurs through formation of the ISGF3 transcription complex. Furthermore, we find that rSV5 infection of cells prevents production of IFN-beta. The transcription factor IRF-3 which is required for transcription of the IFN-beta gene is not translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in rSV5-infected cells. In contrast, in rSV5VDeltaC-infected cells IRF-3 is localized predominantly in the nucleus and IFN-beta is produced. By using ectopic expression of IRF-3, it was shown that after dsRNA treatment and expression of the V protein IRF-3 remained in the cytoplasm, whereas after dsRNA treatment and expression of the P protein (which lacks the C-terminal cysteine-rich domain) IRF-3 was localized predominantly in the nucleus. Thus, SV5 blocks two distinct pathways of the innate immune response, both of which require the presence of the C-terminal specific cysteine-rich domain of the multifunctional SV5 V protein. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
4961;8031455;The use of 32P-postlabelling to detect DNA adducts produced by experimental anticancer drugs: DNA-directed nitrogen mustards.;DNA alkylation by four acridine-linked 'DNA-targeted' aniline mustard derivatives has been studied by 32P-postlabelling. P1 nuclease digestion proved much more efficient than butanol extraction for enhancing the yield of adducted bases for these somewhat hydrophilic compounds. The yield of adducts was maximal after approximately 4 h digestion with micrococcal nuclease/spleen phosphodiesterase and remained relatively constant after that up to 24 h, suggesting that the adducts formed are stable under these conditions. There was some variation in the rates of phosphorylation of the adducts by T4 polynucleotide kinase, with optimal labelling generally occurring after 1 h. The (CH2)5O-linked half-mustard derivative 1 gave five nucleotide 3'-diphosphate adduct spots with calf thymus DNA. Two of these were identified as the adenine N1 and N3 adducts, corresponding to those previously identified as the main base adducts formed by 1 following acid digestion studies. The corresponding full mustard also gave five adduct spots. In contrast, the (CH2)3-linked half-mustard 3 gave only two adduct spots, the most intense of which was identified as a guanine adduct. The corresponding full mustard 4 gave three adduct spots, two of which were identified as guanine adducts. These results agree well with those obtained for the same compounds by the more tedious methods of acid digestion to base adducts, followed by isolation on HPLC, and show that the technique of 32P-labelling can be usefully applied to the study of alkylation of DNA by this class of 'targeted' mustards.;-;-;-;hard_0

4968;22442143;The AT-hook motif-containing protein AHL22 regulates flowering initiation by modifying FLOWERING LOCUS T chromatin in Arabidopsis.;Coordination of the onset of flowering with developmental status and seasonal cues is critical for reproductive success in plants. Molecular genetic studies on Arabidopsis mutants that have alterations in flowering time have identified a wide array of genes that belong to distinct genetic flowering pathways. The flowering time genes are regulated through versatile molecular and biochemical mechanisms, such as controlled RNA metabolism and chromatin modifications. Recent studies have shown that a group of AT-hook DNA-binding motif-containing proteins plays a role in plant developmental processes and stress responses. Here, we demonstrate that the AT-hook protein AHL22 (AT-hook motif nuclear localized 22) regulates flowering time by modifying FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) chromatin in Arabidopsis. AHL22 binds to a stretch of the AT-rich sequence in the FT locus. It interacts with a subset of histone deacetylases. An Arabidopsis mutant overexpressing the AHL22 gene (OE-AHL22) exhibited delayed flowering, and FT transcription was significantly reduced in the mutant. Consistent with the delayed flowering and FT suppression in the OE-AHL22 mutant, histone 3 (H3) acetylation was reduced and H3 lysine 9 dimethylation was elevated in the FT chromatin. We propose that AHL22 acts as a chromatin remodeling factor that modifies the architecture of FT chromatin by modulating both H3 acetylation and methylation. ;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Molecular cloning of the homologues from Drosophila melanogaster and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.;Phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activator (PTPA), a 37 kDa cytosolic protein that specifically activates the phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activity of the dimeric form of PP2A, was cloned from Drosophila melanogaster and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Sequence alignment of PTPA from yeast to human revealed highly conserved regions including the type B fragment of the putative PTPA ATP binding site. We generated PTPA deletion mutants of these conserved regions as well as point mutations within regions that were suggested to be functionally important. The recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli and subsequently purified. Activity measurements, linked with immunological detection, revealed that most of the well-conserved regions are essential for PTPA activity. However, neither the type A fragment of the putative ATP binding site nor the cysteine-rich region, present in all but the Drosophila and yeast homologues, appeared to be essential for PTPA activity. Moreover, we observed that PTPA truncated at glycine266 behaves as a dominant negative mutant since it is inhibitory to the wild-type PTPA.;polycysteine;phosphatase activity;-;LCR_with_function

4973;15824120;SUMOylation of the polyglutamine repeat protein, ataxin-1, is dependent on a functional nuclear localization signal.;SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) is a member of the ubiquitin family of proteins. SUMO targets include proteins involved in numerous roles including nuclear transport and transcriptional regulation. The previous finding that mutant ataxin-1[82Q] disrupted promyelocytic leukemia (PML) oncogenic domains prompted us to determine whether ataxin-1 disrupts another component of PML oncogenic domains, Sp100 (100-kDa Speckled protein). Similar to the PML protein, mutant ataxin-1[82Q] redistributed Sp100 to mutant ataxin-1[82Q] nuclear inclusions. Based on the ability of PML and Sp100 to be covalently modified by SUMO, we investigated the ability of ataxin-1 to be SUMOylated. SUMO-1 was found to covalently modify the polyglutamine repeat protein ataxin-1. There was a decrease in ataxin-1 SUMOylation in the presence of the expanded polyglutamine tract, ataxin-1[82Q]. The phospho-mutant, ataxin-1[82Q]-S776A, restored SUMO levels to those of wild-type ataxin-1[30Q]. SUMOylation of ataxin-1 was dependent on a functional nuclear localization signal. Ataxin-1 SUMOylation was mapped to at least five lysine residues. Lys(16), Lys(194) preceding the polyglutamine tract, Lys(610)/Lys(697) in the C-terminal ataxin high mobility group domain, and Lys(746) all contribute to ataxin-1 SUMOylation. ;polyglutamine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

It was established that the heterogeneity of poly-Hb-PLP is mainly depicted by polydispersion of molecular weight and less by the changes in the isoelectric properties. The qualitative difference has been shown between the immunochemical properties of the native hemoglobin and poly-Hb-PLP, which gives the suggestion of the formation of new antigenic determinants as a result of chemical modification and of more expressed antigenicity of modified hemoglobin compared with native protein. Poly-Hb-PLP has wide antigenic spectrum that corresponds to its structural heterogeneity. The data obtained suggest that the decrease in the antigenic activity of poly-Hb-PLP can be achieved by the lowering of the part of high molecular weight components. ;polyhistidine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
4983;30541149;Factor cooperation for chromosome discrimination in Drosophila.;Transcription regulators select their genomic binding sites from a large pool of similar, non-functional sequences. Although general principles that allow such discrimination are known, the complexity of DNA elements often precludes a prediction of functional sites. The process of dosage compensation in Drosophila allows exploring the rules underlying binding site selectivity. The male-specific-lethal (MSL) Dosage Compensation Complex (DCC) selectively binds to some 300 X chromosomal 'High Affinity Sites' (HAS) containing GA-rich 'MSL recognition elements' (MREs), but disregards thousands of other MRE sequences in the genome. The DNA-binding subunit MSL2 alone identifies a subset of MREs, but fails to recognize most MREs within HAS. The 'Chromatin-linked adaptor for MSL proteins' (CLAMP) also interacts with many MREs genome-wide and promotes DCC binding to HAS. Using genome-wide DNA-immunoprecipitation we describe extensive cooperativity between both factors, depending on the nature of the binding sites. These are explained by physical interaction between MSL2 and CLAMP. In vivo, both factors cooperate to compete with nucleosome formation at HAS. The male-specific MSL2 thus synergises with a ubiquitous GA-repeat binding protein for refined X/autosome discrimination. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
4986;18797134;BMP2-induced gene profiling in dental epithelial cell line.;Tooth development is regulated by epithelial-mesenchymal interactions and their reciprocal molecular signaling. Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) is known as one of the inducers for tooth development. To analyze the molecular mechanisms of BMP2 on ameloblast differentiation (amelogenesis), we performed microarray analyses using rat dental epithelial cell line, HAT-7. After confirming that BMP2 could activate the canonical BMP-Smads signaling in HAT-7 cells, we analyzed the effects of BMP2 on 14,815 gene expressions and profiled them. Seventy-three genes were up-regulated and 28 genes were down-regulated by BMP2 treatment for 24 hours in HAT-7 cells. Functional classification revealed that 18% of up-regulated genes were ECM/adhesion molecules present in the enamel organ. Furthermore, we examined the expression of several differentiation markers in dental epithelial four cell-lineages including inner enamel epithelium (ameloblasts), stratum intermedium, stratum reticulum, and outer enamel epithelium. The results indicated that BMP2 might induce at least two different cell-lineage markers including a BMP antagonist expressed in HAT-7 cells, suggesting that BMP2 could accelerate amelogenesis via BMP signaling.;-;-;-;hard_0
4987;9581940;Feeding lactating primiparous sows to establish three divergent metabolic states: II. Effect on nitrogen partitioning and skeletal muscle composition.;"We established an experimental model to study nitrogen (N) partitioning in lactating primiparous sows alimented to three levels of nutrient intake. Thirty-six sows fitted with a gastric cannula and fed a 15.4 MJ DE/kg and 18.6% CP diet were allocated to one of three treatments after farrowing: 1) ad libitum-fed; 2) restricted-fed to 55% of the ad libitum feed intake; and 3) superalimented to at least 125% of the ad libitum feed intake. These feed intakes were successfully achieved throughout lactation. Nitrogen balance was studied for three 5-d periods starting on d 2, 11, and 19 of lactation, and a triceps muscle biopsy was taken on d 26. For all treatments, N intake increased, milk N production increased, urinary N losses decreased, but fecal N losses increased as the 28-d lactation progressed. Restricted-fed sows had the lowest fecal N and urinary losses and mobilized the most maternal protein (-23.0 vs -7.4 +/- 6.5 g N/d for ad libitum-fed sows) during lactation. As a consequence of these economies, and extensive protein mobilization, restricted-fed sows were able to maintain milk N production similar to that of sows on the other treatments. Superalimented sows did not mobilize protein, had the poorest protein digestibility, directed the least digestible N toward milk (40.1 vs 78.3% in restricted-fed sows), and produced amounts of milk N similar to those produced by sows on the other treatments. The treatment differences in N retention measured by N balance were reflected in differences in skeletal muscle variables and urinary creatinine. Skeletal muscle cell size (protein:DNA ratio) and protein synthetic capacity (RNA:DNA ratio) increased in response to feed intake. The protein:DNA ratio increased (P < .01) linearly and the RNA:DNA ratio increased (P < .05) in a curvilinear manner. These data suggest that primiparous sows partition additional retained N toward their maternal reserves rather than milk N. They also suggest that sows fed inadequate N intakes maintain milk production by mobilizing maternal protein reserves. Such sows also conserve maternal N during lactation, possibly by reducing muscle protein synthesis.";-;-;-;hard_0
4989;19306002;A 43-bp A/T-rich element upstream of the kinesin gene AtKP1 promoter functions as a silencer in Arabidopsis.;The expression of the Arabidopsis thaliana kinesin-like protein 1 (AtKP1) gene is restricted to tender tissues. We used a 5'-deletion assay to identify and characterize the regulatory regions controlling tissue-specific AtKP1 expression. Multiple enhancer regions, located 470- and 2,808-bp upstream of the translational start codon, were critical for activation, while a silencer region located at -2,987 to -2,808 (A + T = 71%) was required for repression. Within this 180-bp fragment, a 43-bp element (termed KPRE, A + T = 58%) mediated repression of the CaMV35S promoter by using a gain-of-function approach that was orientation-dependent in leaves and orientation-independent in roots. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that the GAGAAATT octamer (corresponding to neucleotides -2,908 - -2,900) in KPRE was the core negative regulatory motif for interacting with DNA-binding proteins in leaves and roots. However, using a second gain-of-function experiment with KPRE fused to CaMV35S, we found that the mutant negatively affected transcription in transgenic leaves and positively affected transcription in transgenic roots. This indicated that these two modes mediate repressive regulation in leaves and roots, respectively. The EMSA experiment using different mutant KPRE as probes confirmed that two distinct sets of proteins bound to KPRE at an overlapping site AGAAAT in the leaf. Taken together, these data suggest that two different modes control the negatively transcriptional regulation of KPRE in leaves and roots, and provide new insight into the mechanism of transcriptional repression of A/T-rich sequences in higher plants. ;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
4990;26681201;From Insect to Man: Photorhabdus Sheds Light on the Emergence of Human Pathogenicity.;"Photorhabdus are highly effective insect pathogenic bacteria that exist in a mutualistic relationship with Heterorhabditid nematodes. Unlike other members of the genus, Photorhabdus asymbiotica can also infect humans. Most Photorhabdus cannot replicate above 34°C, limiting their host-range to poikilothermic invertebrates. In contrast, P. asymbiotica must necessarily be able to replicate at 37°C or above. Many well-studied mammalian pathogens use the elevated temperature of their host as a signal to regulate the necessary changes in gene expression required for infection. Here we use RNA-seq, proteomics and phenotype microarrays to examine temperature dependent differences in transcription, translation and phenotype of P. asymbiotica at 28°C versus 37°C, relevant to the insect or human hosts respectively. Our findings reveal relatively few temperature dependant differences in gene expression. There is however a striking difference in metabolism at 37°C, with a significant reduction in the range of carbon and nitrogen sources that otherwise support respiration at 28°C. We propose that the key adaptation that enables P. asymbiotica to infect humans is to aggressively acquire amino acids, peptides and other nutrients from the human host, employing a so called ""nutritional virulence"" strategy. This would simultaneously cripple the host immune response while providing nutrients sufficient for reproduction. This might explain the severity of ulcerated lesions observed in clinical cases of Photorhabdosis. Furthermore, while P. asymbiotica can invade mammalian cells they must also resist immediate killing by humoral immunity components in serum. We observed an increase in the production of the insect Phenol-oxidase inhibitor Rhabduscin normally deployed to inhibit the melanisation immune cascade. Crucially we demonstrated this molecule also facilitates protection against killing by the alternative human complement pathway.";-;-;-;hard_0
5000;3246349;Senescence in Podospora anserina: a possible role for nucleic acid interacting proteins suggested by the sequence analysis of a mitochondrial DNA region specifically amplified in senescent cultures.;In Podospora anserina, the phenomenon of senescence was previously shown to be correlated with the presence of a senescence-specific DNA (sen-DNA) resulting from the amplification of some regions (alpha, beta, gamma, epsilon) of the mitochondrial chromosome. The beta region gives rise to sen-DNAs with variable sizes and junctions which share a 1,100-bp common sequence. Here we report the complete nucleotide sequence of one 4-kb beta sen-DNA. Included in the sequence are a large part of the first intron open reading frame (ORF) of the gene ND4L and three short unidentified ORFs more precisely located in the common beta region. The primary structure of the polypeptide possibly encoded by one of them is very similar to the glycine-rich domains present in various single-stranded DNA-binding proteins. The comparison of the information content of this beta sen-DNA with that of other previously sequenced sen-DNAs suggests that the role in the senescence process attributed to the sen-DNAs could be related to the overproduction of a variety of proteins which interact with nucleic acids.; polyglycine ;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
5005;8029301;Blocking effects of ethanol on stress-induced activation of rat mesoprefrontal dopamine neurons.;We investigated the effects of ethanol on stress-induced activation of the brain dopamine (DA) systems in rats. Ethanol (0.5 and 1.0 g/kg) was injected IP 25 min before sacrifice (5 min before 20-min immobilization stress). Ethanol treatment by itself did not affect the levels of either DA or its major metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), in the mesoprefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, olfactory tubercle, or caudate putamen. Immobilization stress for 20 min caused increases in DOPAC levels in the prefrontal cortex (160% of control) and cingulate cortex (135% of control), but not in the olfactory tubercle or caudate putamen. The stress had no effects on DA levels in any of the four brain regions studied. Pretreatment with ethanol blocked, in a dose-dependent manner, the stress-induced increases in DOPAC levels in the mesoprefrontal cortex. The present data suggest that ethanol exhibits a blocking effect on stress-induced activation of the mesoprefrontal DA neurons.

Plasmids from a cDNA library generated with poly(A)+ RNA of a mouse fibrosarcoma line CMS5j and pdl3027 (polyoma T antigen) were co-transfected into L cells.

The assessment of blood pressure (BP) response during exercise test is an important diagnostic instrument in cardiovascular system evaluation. The study aim was to determine normal values of BP response to submaximal, multistage exercise test in healthy adults with regard to their age, gender, and workload. Materials and Methods. The study was conducted in randomly selected normotensive subjects (n = 1015), 512 females and 498 males, aged 18-64 years (mean age 42.1 ± 12.7 years) divided into five age groups. All subjects were clinically healthy with no chronic diseases diagnosed. Exercise stress tests were performed using Monark bicycle ergometer until a minimum of 85% of physical capacity was reached. BP was measured at rest and at peak of each exercise test stage. Results. The relations between BP, age, and workload during exercise test were determined by linear regression analysis and can be illustrated by the equations: systolic BP (mmHg) = 0.346 × load (W) + 135.76 for males and systolic BP (mmHg) = 0.103 × load (W) + 155.72 for females. Conclusions. Systolic BP increases significantly and proportionally to workload increase during exercise test in healthy adults.

5010;10678928;Pathogenic mechanism of mouse brain damage caused by oral infection with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157:H7.;In a previous study, we showed that infection with Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing Escherichia coli O157:H7 (strain Sm(r)N-9) caused neurologic symptoms in malnourished mice with positive immunoreactions of Stx2 in brain tissues. The present study explores the mechanism of how Stx injures the vascular endothelium to enter the central nervous system in mice. Oral infection with strain Sm(r)N-9 elicited a tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) response in the blood as early as 2 days after infection, while Stx was first detected at 3 days postinfection. In the brain, TNF-alpha was detected at day 3, and its quantity was increased over the next 3 days. Frozen sections of the brains from moribound mice contained high numbers of apoptotic cells. Glycolipids recognized by an anti-Gb3 monoclonal antibody were extracted from the brain, and purified Stx2 was able to bind to the glycolipids. In human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) cultured with fluorescein-labeled Stx2 (100 ng/ml), TNF-alpha (20 U/ml) significantly facilitated the intracellular compartmentalization of fluorescence during 24 h of incubation, suggesting the enhanced intracellular processing of Stx2. Consequently, higher levels of apoptosis in HUVEC were found at 48 h. Short-term exposure of HUVEC to Stx2 abrogated their apoptotic response to subsequent incubation with TNF-alpha alone or TNF-alpha and Stx2. In contrast, primary exposure of HUVEC to TNF-alpha followed by exposure to Stx2 alone or TNF-alpha and Stx2 induced apoptosis at the same level as obtained after 48-h incubation with these two agents. These results suggest that the rapid production of circulating TNF-alpha after infection induces a state of competence in vascular endothelial cells to undergo apoptosis, which would be finally achieved by subsequent elevation of Stx in the blood. In this synergistic action, target cells must be first exposed to TNF-alpha. Such cell injury may be a prerequisite to brain damage after infection with Stx-producing E. coli O157:H7.;-;-;-;hard_0

5016;33766547;Research progress on the regulation of nutrition and immunity by microRNAs in fish.;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of highly conserved, endogenous non-coding single-stranded small RNA molecules with a length of 18-25 nucleotides. MiRNAs can negatively regulate the target gene through complementary pairing with the mRNA. It has been more than 20 years since the discovery of miRNA molecules, and many achievements have been made in fish research. This paper reviews the research progress in the regulation of fish nutrition and immunity by miRNAs in recent years. MiRNAs regulate the synthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, and are involved in the metabolism of glucose, lipids, as well as cholesterol in fish. Moreover, miRNAs play various roles in antibacterial and antiviral immunity of fish. They can promote the immune response of fish, but may also participate in the immune escape mechanism of bacteria or viruses. One important aspect of miRNAs regulation on fish immunity is mediated by targeting pattern recognition receptors and downstream signaling factors. Together, current results indicate that miRNAs are widely involved in the complex regulatory network of fish. Further studies on fish miRNAs may deepen our understanding of the regulatory network of fish nutrition and immunity, and have the potential to promote the development of microRNA-based products and detection reagents that can be applied in aquaculture industry.;-;-;-;hard_0
5020;8270131;Insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity is reduced in monocytes from non-obese normoglycaemic insulin-resistant subjects.;Insulin sensitivity has been quantified by i.v. insulin tolerance test (0.1 U/kg of body weight) in 18 (11 male/7 female) non-obese (body mass index range 19-25 kg/m2) normoglycaemic subjects. We then compared the tyrosine kinase activity and internalization of insulin receptor in monocytes from the six most insulin-sensitive (group 1) and the six most insulin-resistant (group 3) subjects. Tyrosine kinase activity was measured on immunopurified receptors using 32P-ATP and poly-glutamic acid 4: tyrosine 1, sodium salt (poly-glu-tyr 4:1). Insulin internalization was studied by incubating cells with 1 nmol/l 125I-insulin and measuring total cell-bound and intracellular 125I-insulin by an acid dissociation procedure. Basal (in the absence of insulin) receptor kinase activity was similar in both groups. Maximal (in the presence of 100 nmol/l insulin) kinase activity was 41% lower in group 3 (13.8 +/- 3.6 fmoles 32P-ATP incorporated vs 23.3 +/- 4.0, p = 0.1). Delta increment of receptor kinase activity after insulin stimulation (calculated by subtracting basal from maximal activity) was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced in group 3 (21.3 +/- 3.8 vs 11.1 +/- 2.1) and significantly (p < 0.05) correlated to the in vivo insulin sensitivity. Both total cell-bound (0.70 +/- 0.09% of total radioactivity added vs 0.83 +/- 0.15) and intracellular (0.39 +/- 0.05 vs 0.44 +/- 0.09) 125I-insulin were similar in the two groups. These data suggest that in non-obese, normoglycaemic subjects a defective insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity may contribute to the development of insulin resistance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS);polyglutamic;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
5024;27997579;The C-Terminal SynMuv/DdDUF926 Domain Regulates the Function of the N-Terminal Domain of DdNKAP.;NKAP (NF-κB activating protein) is a highly conserved SR (serine/arginine-rich) protein involved in transcriptional control and splicing in mammals. We identified DdNKAP, the Dictyostelium discoideum ortholog of mammalian NKAP, as interacting partner of the nuclear envelope protein SUN-1. DdNKAP harbors a number of basic RDR/RDRS repeats in its N-terminal domain and the SynMuv/DUF926 domain at its C-terminus. We describe a novel and direct interaction between DdNKAP and Prp19 (Pre mRNA processing factor 19) which might be relevant for the observed DdNKAP ubiquitination. Genome wide analysis using cross-linking immunoprecipitation-high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-seq) revealed DdNKAP association with intergenic regions, exons, introns and non-coding RNAs. Ectopic expression of DdNKAP and its domains affects several developmental aspects like stream formation, aggregation, and chemotaxis. We conclude that DdNKAP is a multifunctional protein, which might influence Dictyostelium development through its interaction with RNA and RNA binding proteins. Mutants overexpressing full length DdNKAP and the N-terminal domain alone (DdN-NKAP) showed opposite phenotypes in development and opposite expression profiles of several genes and rRNAs. The observed interaction between DdN-NKAP and the DdDUF926 domain indicates that the DdDUF926 domain acts as negative regulator of the N-terminus. ;polyarginine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
5030;26920689;Acid-Sensing Ion Channels as Potential Pharmacological Targets in Peripheral and Central Nervous System Diseases.;Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are widely expressed in the body and represent good sensors for detecting protons. The pH drop in the nervous system is equivalent to ischemia and acidosis, and ASICs are very good detectors in discriminating slight changes in acidity. ASICs are important pharmacological targets being involved in a variety of pathophysiological processes affecting both the peripheral nervous system (e.g., peripheral pain, diabetic neuropathy) and the central nervous system (e.g., stroke, epilepsy, migraine, anxiety, fear, depression, neurodegenerative diseases, etc.). This review discusses the role played by ASICs in different pathologies and the pharmacological agents acting on ASICs that might represent promising drugs. As the majority of above-mentioned pathologies involve not only neuronal dysfunctions but also microvascular alterations, in the next future, ASICs may be also considered as potential pharmacological targets at the vasculature level. Perspectives and limitations in the use of ASICs antagonists and modulators as pharmaceutical agents are also discussed.;-;-;-;hard_0
5040;18662672;Physcomitrella HMGA-type proteins display structural differences compared to their higher plant counterparts.;High mobility group (HMG) proteins of the HMGA family are chromatin-associated proteins that act as architectural factors in nucleoprotein structures involved in gene transcription. To date, HMGA-type proteins have been studied in various higher plant species, but not in lower plants. We have identified two HMGA-type proteins, HMGA1 and HMGA2, encoded in the genome of the moss model Physcomitrella patens. Compared to higher plant HMGA proteins, the two Physcomitrella proteins display some structural differences. Thus, the moss HMGA proteins have six (rather than four) AT-hook DNA-binding motifs and their N-terminal domain lacks similarity to linker histone H1. HMGA2 is expressed in moss protonema and it localises to the cell nucleus. Typical of HMGA proteins, HMGA2 interacts preferentially with A/T-rich DNA, when compared with G/C-rich DNA. In cotransformation assays in Physcomitrella protoplasts, HMGA2 stimulated reporter gene expression. In summary, our data show that functional HMGA-type proteins occur in Physcomitrella. ;polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
5041;8948650;Molecular analysis of RNA polymerase alpha subunit gene from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2).;The rpoA gene, encoding the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase, was cloned from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). It is preceded by rpsK and followed by rplQ, encoding ribosomal proteins S11 and L17, respectively, similar to the gene order in Bacillus subtilis. The rpoA gene specifies a protein of 339 amino acids with deduced molecular mass of 36,510 Da, exhibiting 64.3 and 70.7% similarity over its entire length to Escherichia coli and B. subtilis alpha subunits, respectively. Using T7 expression system, we overexpressed the S. coelicolor alpha protein in E. coli. A small fraction of this protein was found to be assembled into E. coli RNA polymerase. Antibody against S. coelicolor alpha protein crossreacted with that of B. subtilis more than with the E. coli alpha subunit. The ability of recombinant alpha protein to assemble beta and beta' subunits into core enzyme in vitro was examined by measuring the core enzyme activity. Maximal reconstitution was obtained at alpha2:beta+beta' ratio of 1:2.3, indicating that the recombinant alpha protein is fully functional for subunit assembly. Similar results were also obtained for natural alpha protein. Limited proteolysis with endoproteinase Glu-C revealed that S. coelicolor alpha contains a tightly folded N-terminal domain and the C-terminal region is more protease-sensitive than that of E. coli alpha.;-;-;-;hard_0
5042;9177049;A novel proline-rich glycoprotein associated with the extracellular matrix of vascular bundles of Brassica petioles.;A panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAC204, MAC236, MAC265) which recognise extracellular matrix glycoproteins implicated in plant-microbe interactions has been used to study glycoprotein antigens in petioles of turnip (Brassica campestris L.). While MAC204 recognised two glycoproteins (gp120 and gp45) with apparent M(r) 120,000 and 45,000 in petiole extracts made with 2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol (Tris) buffer containing sodium dodecyl sulfate, MAC236 recognised gp120 but not gp45, and MAC265 gave no or only weak reactivity. Tissue dissection studies established that gp120 was predominantly associated with the vascular bundle whereas gp45 was largely associated with the pith. This was consistent with results from tissue prints probed with MAC204 and MAC236 which also suggested a vascular localisation for gp120. Immunoelectronmicroscopy showed that MAC204 and MAC236 both labelled three-way junctions between cells of the phloem and sclerid fibres. Both gp120 and gp45 were shown to carry epitopes in common with known hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins. Unlike gp45, gp120 could be extracted from petioles with Tris buffer alone and then isolated from this extract by trichloroacetic acid treatment (which left gp120 soluble), followed by size-exclusion and ion-exchange chromatography. Amino acid analysis revealed gp120 to be a novel glycoprotein, particularly rich in proline, lysine, valine and threonine but relatively poor in hydroxyproline. The most abundant sugars were arabinose and galactose. The potential role of this very basic cell surface glycoprotein in plant defence against microbes is discussed. ;polyproline;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

The thoracolumbar outflow (Th12-L3) of the centers for emission and psychogenic erection is usually damaged in this procedure. About 12% of the radically lymph node dissected patients complained of permanent erectile disturbances; 85% of the radically lymph node dissected patients revealed ejaculatory disorders, 58% of them with a total loss of ejaculation. About 50% of them showed a considerable psychic involvement. In 12 patients a modified lymph node dissection procedure was performed with the intention to preserve ejaculatory capability. Nevertheless 6 (50%) of them revealed postoperative ejaculatory failure, 3 of them with a total loss of ejaculation. Thus our own experiences and a review of the literature indicate that this modified lymph node dissection often fails in its purpose and can not always be considered a valuable procedure for preservation of ejaculation. The administration of sympathomimetic drugs and/or imipramine is a promising approach in the treatment of ejaculatory failure.";-;-;-;hard_0

5054;8607335;Second trimester routine ultrasound and abnormal findings.;"OBJECTIVE
To estimate the detection rate of abnormal findings, especially fetal anomalies, at second trimester ultrasound screening performed in a way representative of Swedish antenatal clinics.


DESIGN
A prospective study carried out over two years in Uppsala county, Sweden, including 8,228 unselected pregnant women (8,345 fetuses). The ultrasound scans were performed by specially trained midwives.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
The number of abnormalities suspected by the midwives and the number of abnormalities confirmed by the obstetricians were registered, as was pregnancy outcome for these cases.


RESULTS
Midwives reported suspected abnormalities at the screening procedure in 59 cases (0.7%), abnormalities were confirmed by obstetricians in 42 cases (0.5%, of which 0.36% were fetal malformations). Seventeen of these 42 pregnancies were terminated and 11 ended with miscarriages or intrauterine fetal deaths. Fourteen of the 42 pregnancies ended with a live born infant, of which two died postnatally.


CONCLUSIONS
The described ultrasound screening procedure led to suspected abnormalities in 0.7% of the scanned cases and to confirmed abnormalities in 0.5% of the cases. The outcome for the confirmed abnormalities was poor, as 71% were either terminated or ended with miscarriage or perinatal death.";-;-;-;hard_0
5056;9758708;A novel alternative spliced variant of the transcription factor AP2alpha is expressed in the murine ocular lens.;The AP2alpha gene encodes a transcription factor containing a basic, helix-span-helix DNA-binding/dimerization domain, which is developmentally regulated and retinoic acid inducible. Recent reports about AP2alpha null mice indicate that AP2alpha plays an important role in embryogenesis, especially in craniofacial development and midline fusion. Ocular development is also affected in these null mice. As AP2alpha may be involved in transcriptional regulation in the lens, it was important to examine the expression of the AP2alpha gene in the lens. Four AP2alpha mRNA variants have been previously isolated from whole mouse embryos. Variants 1, 3, and 4 are transcriptional activators that are transcribed from different promoters and variant 2 is a repressor lacking the activation domain encoded by exon 2. Using in situ-PCR, we found that AP2alpha is expressed in the lens epithelia but not in the lens fibers. RT-PCR analysis of lens mRNA with amplimers specific for each variant revealed that AP2alpha variants 1, 2, and 3 are expressed in newborn mouse lenses. However, variant 4 is not expressed in the lens. In this report we characterized a novel isoform, which we named variant 5, expressed in the lens and kidney. Variant 5, which is generated by alternative splicing, may function as a repressor due to the partial deletion of the proline-rich transactivation domain encoded by exon 2. This is the first molecular characterization of AP2alpha gene expression in the lens. Our results indicate that two activator and two repressor AP2alpha isoforms may play a role in regulating gene expression in the lens.;polyproline;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
5057;20368355;EKLF directly activates the p21WAF1/CIP1 gene by proximal promoter and novel intronic regulatory regions during erythroid differentiation.;The switch from proliferation to differentiation during the terminal stages of erythropoiesis is a tightly controlled process that relies in part on transcription factor-mediated activation of cell cycle components. EKLF is a key transcription factor that is necessary for the initial establishment of the red cell phenotype. Here, we find that EKLF also plays a role during the subsequent differentiation process, as it induces p21(WAF1/CIP1) expression independent of p53 to regulate the changes in the cell cycle underlying erythroid maturation. EKLF activates p21 not only by directly binding to an EKLF site within a previously characterized GC-rich region in the p21 proximal promoter but also by occupancy at a novel, phylogenetically conserved region that contains consensus CACCC core motifs located downstream from the p21 TATA box. Our findings demonstrate that EKLF, likely in coordination with other transcription factors, directly contributes to the complex set of events that occur at the final erythroid cell divisions and accentuates terminal differentiation directly by activation of CDK inhibitors such as p21. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

Sp1 has also been implicated in the formation of a nucleosome-free region in Simian virus 40 (SV40) minichromosomes. To investigate the potential functions of Sp1 in remodeling chromatin structures, Sp1 was analyzed for the ability to bind its recognition sites (GC boxes) in DNA fragments reconstituted into nucleosome cores. Sp1 was found to bind to the GC boxes of the SV40 early promoter when this element was reconstituted into nucleosome cores. The affinity of Sp1 for the nucleosomal SV40 early promoter DNA was reduced approximately 10-20-fold relative to naked DNA. A peptide containing only the zinc fingers of Sp1 was also capable of binding nucleosomal DNA, indicating that the glutamine-rich and serine/threonine-rich domains of Sp1 are not required for nucleosome binding. The binding of Sp1 to nucleosome cores resulted in the formation of a ternary Sp1-nucleosome complex.";polyglutamine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function

In cell culture, HHV8 is primarily latent, and viral genes associated with lytic replication are not expressed. Two lytic origins of DNA replication (oriLyt) are present within the HHV8 genome and are composed of an AT-rich region adjacent to GC-rich DNA sequences. We have now identified essential cis- and trans-acting elements required for oriLyt-dependent DNA replication. The transient replication assay was used to show that two AT-rich elements, three consensus AP1 transcription factor-binding sites, an ORF50 response element (RE), and a consensus TATA box motif are essential for efficient origin-dependent DNA replication. Transient transfection of luciferase reporter constructs indicated that the downstream region of the HHV8 oriLyt responds to ORF50 and suggests that part of the oriLyt may be an enhancer/promoter. In addition, a transient cotransfection-replication assay elucidated the set of trans-acting factors required for lytic DNA replication. These factors consist of homologues to the core replication proteins: ORF6 (ssDNA binding protein), ORF9 (DNA polymerase), ORF40-41 (primase-associated factor), ORF44 (helicase), ORF56 (primase), and ORF59 (polymerase processivity factor) common to all herpesviruses along with ORF50 (K-Rta) and K8 (K-bZIP). ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

Patients treated with azelaic/glycolic acid experienced a significantly greater reduction in the number of papules, as well as a greater reduction in the number of inflammatory lesions, than those treated with tretinoin. Overall global improvement was approximately 25% in both groups. In the physician evaluations, treatment with azelaic/glycolic acid was found to cause significantly less dryness, scaling, and erythema than tretinoin. Patients also reported significantly less dryness, redness, and peeling with azelaic/glycolic acid. Significantly more patients in the azelaic/glycolic acid group than the tretinoin group reported that they felt attractive.

5063;8269149;Assessing the severity of aortic valve stenosis by spectral analysis of cardiac murmurs (spectral vibrocardiography). Part I: Technical aspects.;Assessing the severity of aortic stenosis remains an important clinical problem. The turbulent pressure fluctuations generated by the confined jet down-stream of the stenotic valve produce vibrations in the aortic wall. These vibrations are transmitted through the chest to the skin surface, where they can be measured as systolic ejection murmurs. The purpose of the present study was to find the relationship between the severity of aortic valve stenosis and the frequency content of the precordial systolic murmurs, and to evaluate the transthoracic attenuation of murmurs and its variation from patient to patient. Twenty-four patients with clinical signs of aortic stenosis underwent cardiac catheterization to measure the peak transvalvular pressure difference. The mean energy density spectrum of the measured systolic precordial murmurs was calculated and the murmur energy ratio between 100-500 Hz and 20-500 Hz was correlated to the transvalvular pressure difference. The inter-individual variability of the transthoracic attenuation was evaluated by calculating the transthoracic transfer function from simultaneous measurements of precordial vibrations at the second right intercostal space and intravascular recordings of high frequency pressure fluctuations in the ascending aorta. The transvalvular pressure difference and the square root of the murmur energy ratio correlated well (r = 0.81, SEE = 27 mmHg). In the frequency range from 10-500 Hz the transthoracic transfer function could be modelled by a low-pass filter function with a low frequency attenuation of 36 +/- 7.7 dB (mean +/- SD), a corner frequency of 26 +/- 12 Hz and an attenuation slope of -29 +/- 7.9 dB/decade. Spectral analysis of systolic murmurs might be an attractive non-invasive addition to the array of techniques already in use for assessing the severity of aortic stenosis. It is a simple and cost effective technique, and requires less skill and time for data analysis than conventional methods.;-;-;-;hard_0
5064;19109157;Epigenetic regulation of Foxp3 expression in regulatory T cells by DNA methylation.;Foxp3, a winged-helix family transcription factor, serves as the master switch for CD4(+) regulatory T cells (Treg). We identified a unique and evolutionarily conserved CpG-rich island of the Foxp3 nonintronic upstream enhancer and discovered that a specific site within it was unmethylated in natural Treg (nTreg) but heavily methylated in naive CD4(+) T cells, activated CD4(+) T cells, and peripheral TGFbeta-induced Treg in which it was bound by DNMT1, DNMT3b, MeCP2, and MBD2. Demethylation of this CpG site using the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Aza) induced acetylation of histone 3, interaction with TIEG1 and Sp1, and resulted in strong and stable induction of Foxp3. Conversely, IL-6 resulted in methylation of this site and repression of Foxp3 expression. Aza plus TGFbeta-induced Treg resembled nTreg, expressing similar receptors, cytokines, and stable suppressive activity. Strong Foxp3 expression and suppressor activity could be induced in a variety of T cells, including human CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells. Epigenetic regulation of Foxp3 can be predictably controlled with DNMT inhibitors to generate functional, stable, and specific Treg. ;polyglycine;helix;-;LCR_with_function

Characteristics of 5-HT3Rs appear to be heterogeneous among species, but human 5-HT3R cDNA has not been identified. We isolated a cDNA encoding 5-HT3R from human hippocampus. The mouse 5-HT3R gene has been reported to generate two alternative splicing isoforms that differ by six amino acids. All of our isolated human clones corresponded to the shorter isoform. Amino acid identities with mouse neuroblastoma N1E-115 and rat brain 5-HT3Rs were 84% for each. Southern blot analysis of human genomic DNA suggested that our cloned transcript encoded a human counterpart for the rodent 5-HT3Rs. This gene was assigned to chromosome 11 using polymerase chain reaction analysis of a human/rodent somatic cell hybrid panel. With the use of Northern blot analysis, 5-HT3R transcripts were identified in human small intestine, colon, and brain regions including hippocampus, amygdala, and striatum. In human heart, 5-HT3R expression was not detectable even with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, although it was detectable in mouse heart. Transfection of COS-1 with human 5-HT3R cDNA induced specific binding of the 5-HT3R-selective radioligand [3H]YM060. Human 5-HT3R showed typical characteristics of the 5-HT3R, but its affinity for the 5-HT3R agonist m-chlorophenylbiguanide was much lower than that of rat 5-HT3R. When injected with human 5-HT3R cRNA, the oocytes responded to 5-HT3R agonists with a rapidly developing inward current. The potency of the agonists to induce inward current paralleled that to compete with the radioligand binding, and 2-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine, a partial agonist for mouse 5-HT3R, was a full agonist for human 5-HT3R. Our data revealed that the 5-HT3R molecule has interspecies differences in both tissue distribution and functional profile.;-;-;-;hard_0
5070;3710426;The mechanism of elevated alkaline phosphatase activity after bile duct ligation in the rat.;Alkaline phosphatase activity in the liver and intestine increases after bile duct ligation, reportedly by increased enzyme synthesis. To ascertain the mechanism of this increased synthesis in the absence of a cDNA clone encoding the enzyme, we have estimated the concentration of liver and intestinal alkaline phosphatase mRNA by translational analysis. Monospecific antiserum to rat placental alkaline phosphatase was raised. The resulting antiserum precipitated two peptides of 53 and 56 kd after translation of liver poly(A) + RNA. The precipitation of both peptides was blocked by the single 64 kd placental alkaline phosphatase. Processing of the cell-free products by microsomal membranes produced peptides of 62 and 64 kd. Antiserum to rat intestinal alkaline phosphatase also identified two peptides as products of intestinal RNA translation. After bile duct ligation, we confirmed a transient 2-fold increase in alkaline phosphatase activity in the intestine and a more constant 7-fold increase in the liver. However, the alkaline phosphatase mRNA concentration remained unchanged in both organs. We conclude that increased alkaline phosphatase synthesis after bile duct ligation results from an enhanced rate of translation of mRNA.; polyalanine ;phosphatase activity;-;LCR_with_function

In this study, 136 putative bZIP transcription members were identified in Brassica rapa. The bZIP family can be divided into nine groups according to the specific amino acid rich domain in B. rapa and Arabidopsis thaliana. To screen the cold stress responsive BrbZIP genes, we evaluated whether the transcription patterns of the BrbZIP genes were enhanced by cold treatment in the inbred lines, Chiifu and Kenshin, by microarray data analysis and qRT-PCR. The expression level of six genes increased significantly in Kenshin, but these genes were unchanged in Chiifu. These findings suggest that the six genes that encoded proteins containing N-rich regions might be involved in cold stress response.

5075;8912905;Transplanted glial scar impedes olfactory bulb reinnervation.;The olfactory system is the only region of the mammalian central nervous system in which degeneration of the primary sensory neurons results in the development of new neurons and reinnervation of the secondary sensory neurons. Axotomy of the olfactory nerve at the cribriform plate does not cause the formation of a glial scar which blocks nerve regeneration. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a glial scar that formed in the optic nerve would suppress axonal regeneration when transplanted to the site of olfactory nerve axotomy. Primary olfactory neurons were axotomized along the cribriform plate in adult rats. A compact glial scar formed by transection of an adult rat optic nerve 50 to 60 days prior to removal was transplanted into the olfactory nerve axotomy site. The rats were allowed to survive for 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks. Transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) from the nasal cavity by the olfactory neurons was used to examine the temporal and spatial pattern of regeneration of the olfactory nerve after axotomy and axotomy followed by glial scar transplantation. Twenty-one days after olfactory nerve axotomy, HRP was found in the glomerular layer where the primary olfactory axons synapse on the apical dendrites of the secondary olfactory neurons. In the presence of the transplanted glial scar, HRP labeling was not found in certain glomeruli even at 4 weeks postaxotomy. Glial scars formed within the optic nerve impede reinnervation of the olfactory bulb by neurons which have an exceptional regenerative capacity due in part to the ensheathing glia.;-;-;-;hard_0

In the present study, interactions between specific oriS DNA sequences and proteins in uninfected cell extracts were characterized. The formation of one predominant protein-DNA complex, M, was demonstrated in gel shift assays following incubation of uninfected cell extracts with site I DNA. The cellular protein(s) that comprises complex M has been designated origin factor I (OF-I). The OF-I binding site was shown to partially overlap the OBP binding site within site I. Complexes with mobilities indistinguishable from that of complex M also formed with site II and III DNAs in gel shift assays. oriS-containing plasmid DNA mutated in the OF-I binding site exhibited reduced replication efficiency in transient assays, demonstrating a role for this site in oriS function. The OF-I binding site is highly homologous to binding sites for the cellular CCAAT DNA-binding proteins.

A significant and different fall in HbF over the age range studied was noted between females (47%) and males (23%). The difference in mean HbF between the genders was less marked after age 40 years and a small rise in HbF production was measured in females between ages 50 and 54 years.;-;-;-;hard_0
5078;29035136;Functional Identification of Allograft Inflammatory Factor 1-Like Gene in Luning Chicken.;Allograft inflammatory factor-1 (AIF-1) is an inflammation-related protein mainly produced by immune cells, such as monocyte/macrophages and activated T lymphocytes. It is essential for the survival and proinflammatory activity of immune cells. However, the function of AIF-1 in chicken still has not been defined. In the present study, AIF-1-like (AIF1L) gene was identified in Luning chicken. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the molecular weight of the chicken AIF-1 protein was 16290.8 Da. AIF1L contained a Ca2+ binding EF hand and could interact with actin filament. Its transcript was found in all tested tissues including spleen, brain, heart, kidney, liver, thymus, bursa of Fabricius, lung, and a relative low-level expression was detected in leg muscle. Furthermore, AIF1L expression in peripheral blood lymphocyte was depressed in a dose-dependent manner with cadmium exposure and peripheral blood lymphocyte viability decrease displayed a similar pattern with AIF1L expression. The results indicated that newly identified chicken AIF1L might be associated with lymphocyte viability.;-;-;-;hard_0
5081;19541910;Next-generation tag sequencing for cancer gene expression profiling.;We describe a new method, Tag-seq, which employs ultra high-throughput sequencing of 21 base pair cDNA tags for sensitive and cost-effective gene expression profiling. We compared Tag-seq data to LongSAGE data and observed improved representation of several classes of rare transcripts, including transcription factors, antisense transcripts, and intronic sequences, the latter possibly representing novel exons or genes. We observed increases in the diversity, abundance, and dynamic range of such rare transcripts and took advantage of the greater dynamic range of expression to identify, in cancers and normal libraries, altered expression ratios of alternative transcript isoforms. The strand-specific information of Tag-seq reads further allowed us to detect altered expression ratios of sense and antisense (S-AS) transcripts between cancer and normal libraries. S-AS transcripts were enriched in known cancer genes, while transcript isoforms were enriched in miRNA targeting sites. We found that transcript abundance had a stronger GC-bias in LongSAGE than Tag-seq, such that AT-rich tags were less abundant than GC-rich tags in LongSAGE. Tag-seq also performed better in gene discovery, identifying >98% of genes detected by LongSAGE and profiling a distinct subset of the transcriptome characterized by AT-rich genes, which was expressed at levels below those detectable by LongSAGE. Overall, Tag-seq is sensitive to rare transcripts, has less sequence composition bias relative to LongSAGE, and allows differential expression analysis for a greater range of transcripts, including transcripts encoding important regulatory molecules. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
5083;7491047;Mortality after prostatectomy: selection and surgical approach.;Observational studies have found higher long-term mortality after transurethral prostatectomy (TURP) than after open prostatectomy (OP) and that this difference remained after statistical adjustment for comorbidity. This higher mortality has been attributed to the transurethral procedure itself. This association is reassessed here. Time-sequenced hospital and death records were analysed for 13,815 men undergoing prostatectomy (not for cancer) during the years 1963-85. TURP had a lower 30-day case-fatality rate than had OP, a similar 90-day rate, but TURP had a higher one-year rate. By inference, any excess mortality after TURP must begin shortly after the first postoperative month. However, plotting mortality expressed as SMRs, for the three years after operation showed no increase in long-term mortality after TURP, nor was there any concomitant increase in one-year death rates after prostatectomy as TURP replaced OP. Long-term mortality after TURP was close to that expected from background population rates: after SMR for TURP, for the second and third postoperative years, was 100 (95% CI 93-107). In contrast, long-term mortality after OP was lower than expected from population rates with a corresponding SMR of 79 (95% CI 71-88). The apparent excess in long-term mortality after TURP is unlikely to be caused by the operation itself. It is more likely to reflect relatively low long-term mortality in OP patients as a consequence of OP patients having been relatively fitter than those having TURP.;-;-;-;hard_0
5088;15835918;Tandem mass spectrometry for the examination of the posttranslational modifications of high-mobility group A1 proteins: symmetric and asymmetric dimethylation of Arg25 in HMGA1a protein.;High-mobility group (HMG) A1a and A1b proteins are among a family of HMGA proteins that bind to the minor groove of AT-rich regions of DNA. Here we employed tandem mass spectrometry and determined without ambiguity the sites of phosphorylation and the nature of methylation of HMGA1 proteins that were isolated from the PC-3 human prostate cancer cells. We showed by LC-MS/MS that Ser101 and Ser102 were completely phosphorylated in HMGA1a protein, whereas only a portion of the protein was phosphorylated at Ser98. We also found that the HMGA1b protein was phosphorylated at the corresponding sites, that is, Ser90, Ser91 and Ser87. In addition, Arg25, which is within the first DNA-binding AT-hook domain of HMGA1a, was both mono- and dimethylated. Moreover, both symmetric and asymmetric dimethylations were observed. The closely related HMGA1b protein, however, was not methylated. The unambiguous identification of the sites of phosphorylation and the nature of methylation facilitates the future examination of the biological implications of the HMGA1 proteins. ;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
5089;31237705;The Distinct Conformational Landscapes of 4S-Substituted Prolines That Promote an endo Ring Pucker.;4-Substitution on proline directly impacts protein main chain conformational preferences. The structural effects of N-acyl substitution and of 4-substitution were examined by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography on minimal molecules with a proline 4S-nitrobenzoate. The effects of N-acyl substitution on conformation were attenuated in the 4S-nitrobenzoate context, due to the minimal role of the n→π* interaction in stabilizing extended conformations. By X-ray crystallography, an extended conformation was observed for most molecules. The formyl derivative adopted a δ conformation that is observed at the i+2 position of β-turns. Computational analysis indicated that the structures observed crystallographically represent the inherent conformational preferences of 4S-substituted prolines with electron-withdrawing 4-position substituents. The divergent conformational preferences of 4R- and 4S-substituted prolines suggest their wider structure-specific application in molecular design. In particular, the proline endo ring pucker favored by 4S-substituted prolines uniquely promotes the δ conformation [(ϕ, ψ) ≈(-80°, 0°)] found in β-turns. In contrast to other acyl capping groups, the pivaloyl group strongly promoted trans amide bond and polyproline II helix conformation, with a close n→π* interaction in the crystalline state, despite the endo ring pucker, suggesting its special capabilities in promoting compact conformations in ϕ due to its strongly electron-donating character. ;polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function

5093;19223538;Activation of ribosomal RNA transcription by hepatitis C virus involves upstream binding factor phosphorylation via induction of cyclin D1.;Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes chronic infection in humans leading to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. rRNA transcription, catalyzed by RNA polymerase I (Pol I), plays a critical role in ribosome biogenesis, and changes in Pol I transcription rate are associated with profound alterations in the growth rate of the cell. Because rRNA synthesis is intimately linked to cell growth and frequently up-regulated in many cancers, we hypothesized that HCV might have the ability to activate rRNA synthesis in infected cells. We show here that rRNA promoter-mediated transcription is significantly (10- to 12-fold) activated in human liver-derived cells following infection with type 2 JFH-1 HCV or transfection with the subgenomic type 1 HCV replicon. Further analysis revealed that HCV nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) was responsible for activation of rRNA transcription. Both the NH(2)-terminal amphipathic helix and the polyproline motifs of NS5A seem to be essential for rRNA transcription activation. The NS5A-dependent activation of rRNA transcription seems to be due to hyperphosphorylation and consequent activation of upstream binding factor (UBF), a Pol I DNA binding transcription factor. We further show that hyperphosphorylation of UBF occurs as a result of up-regulation of both cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 by the HCV NS5A polypeptide. These results suggest that the endoplasmic reticulum-associated NS5A is able to transduce signals into the nucleoplasm via UBF hyperphosphorylation leading to rRNA transcription activation. These results could, at least in part, explain a mechanism by which HCV contributes to transformation of liver cells. ;polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function

Soon, these drugs will join cyclosporine and OKT3 as significant advancements in our battle against allograft loss and dysfunction caused by rejection.

5097;10085328;Synchronization of local neural networks in the somatosensory cortex: A comparison of stationary and moving stimuli.;Spontaneous and stimulus-induced responses were recorded from neighboring groups of neurons by an array of electrodes in the primary (SI) somatosensory cortex of intact, halothane-anesthetized cats. Cross-correlation analysis was used to characterize the coordination of spontaneous activity and the responses to peripheral stimulation with moving or stationary air jets. Although synchronization was detected in only 10% (88 of 880) of the pairs of single neurons that were recorded, cross-correlation analysis of multiunit responses revealed significant levels of synchronization in 64% of the 123 recorded electrode pairs. Compared with spontaneous activity, both stationary and moving air jets caused substantial increases in the rate, proportion, and temporal precision of synchronized activity in local regions of SI cortex. Among populations of neurons that were synchronized by both types of air-jet stimulation, the mean rate of synchronized activity was significantly higher during moving air-jet stimulation than during stationary air-jet stimulation. Moving air jets also produced significantly higher correlation coefficients than stationary air jets in the raw cross-correlograms (CCGs) but not in the shift-corrected CCGs. The incidence and rate of stimulus-induced synchronization varied with the distance separating the recording sites. For sites separated by </=300 microm, 80% of the multiunit responses displayed significant levels of synchronization during both types of air-jet stimulation. For sites separated by >/=500 microm, only 37% of the multiunit responses were synchronized by discrete stimulation with a single air jet. Measurements of the multiunit CCG peak half-widths showed that the correlated activity produced by moving air jets had slightly less temporal variability than that produced by stationary air jets. These results indicate that moving stimuli produce greater levels of synchronization than stationary stimuli among local groups of SI neurons and suggest that neuronal synchronization may supplement the changes in firing rate which code intensity and other attributes of a cutaneous stimulus.;-;-;-;hard_0
5098;7355797;Sulphate, acid-base, and mineral balances of obese women during weight loss.;Four obese women, each at least 50% above their expected weight for height were maintained in the metabolic unit for 63 days on liquid formula diets of differing protein and calorie content. We made the following findings: 1) When 12 g protein nitrogen was consumed, 1 mEq of acid was excreted in the urine for every 2 mEq of urinary sulphate. 2) On a protein-free diet more acid was excreted in the urine than could be accounted for by oxidation of sulphur to the sulphate which was excreted in the urine. 3) Both increased consumption of protein and a restriction of dietary calories was associated with an increase of urinary acid. 4) Urinary sulphur excretion was closely correlated with nitrogen intake and urinary urea nitrogen excretion. However, on a protein-free diet the ratio of total nitrogen to sulphur in the urine was greater than when 12 g protein nitrogen was consumed. 5) There is some evidence that when total calorie intake was reduced at a level of 12 g protein nitrogen intake, the ratio of urinary urea nitrogen to urinary sulfur decreased. This suggests selective retention of some nonsulphur containing amino acids and/or selective oxidation of sulphur-containing amino acids. 6) In general, urinary calcium and magnesium excretions were depressed both with a decrease in protein consumption and a decrease in caloric intake. 7) The urinary excretions of calcium and magnesium showed a tendency to fall during the 63 days of the experiment. 8) The urinary and fecal phosphorus excretion remained constant during the various metabolic periods of the experiment.;-;-;-;hard_0

5110;8132570;A point mutation leads to an unpaired cysteine residue and a molecular weight polymorphism of a functional platelet beta 3 integrin subunit. The Sra alloantigen system of GPIIIa.;Recently, we described a low frequency platelet alloantigen on human platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) IIIa, termed Sra, that was involved in neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia. To identify the molecular nature of the Sra alloantigen, we analyzed the nucleotide sequence of polymerase chain reaction-amplified GPIIIa mRNA, and found a C2004-->T substitution in seven Sra positive individuals which results in an Arg636-->Cys polymorphism within the cysteine-rich region of GPIIIa. Analysis of allele-specific recombinant forms of GPIIIa that differed only at amino acid residue 636 showed that anti-Sra alloantibodies reacted with the Cys636, but not the Arg636, recombinant form of GPIIIa. Interestingly, under reducing conditions, the Cys636 form of GPIIIa migrated with a slightly increased apparent molecular weight compared with the Arg636 form. Following treatment with Endoglycosidase H, both allelic forms of GPIIIa exhibited the same mobility, however the Sra epitope was lost. Sra positive platelets express the same number of GPIIb-IIIa complexes on their surface as wild-type Sra negative platelets, and also aggregate normally in response to a variety of platelet agonists. Based upon these results, we conclude that 1) GPIIIa residue 636 specifically controls the formation and expression of the Sra alloantigenic determinant, and 2) an unpaired cysteine residue alters the N-linked glycosylation pattern of the extracellular domain of GPIIIa, but affects neither the degree of surface expression nor the adhesive function of the GPIIb-IIIa complex.;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
5111;22582024;Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors and Mithramycin A Impact a Similar Neuroprotective Pathway at a Crossroad between Cancer and Neurodegeneration.;Mithramycin A (MTM) and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are effective therapeutic agents for cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. MTM is a FDA approved aureolic acid-type antibiotic that binds to GC-rich DNA sequences and interferes with Sp1 transcription factor binding to its target sites (GC box). HDACi, on the other hand, modulate the activity of class I and II histone deacetylases. They mediate their protective function, in part, by regulating the acetylation status of histones or transcription factors, including Sp1, and in turn chromatin accessibility to the transcriptional machinery. Because these two classes of structurally and functionally diverse compounds mediate similar therapeutic functions, we investigated whether they act on redundant or synergistic pathways to protect neurons from oxidative death. Non-protective doses of each of the drugs do not synergize to create resistance to oxidative death suggesting that these distinct agents act via a similar pathway. Accordingly, we found that protection by MTM and HDACi is associated with diminished expression of the oncogene, Myc and enhanced expression of a tumor suppressor, p21(waf1/cip1). We also find that neuroprotection by MTM or Myc knockdown is associated with downregulation of class I HDAC levels. Our results support a model in which the established antitumor drug MTM or canonical HDACi act via distinct mechanisms to converge on the downregulation of HDAC levels or activity respectively. These findings support the conclusion that an imbalance in histone acetylase and HDAC activity in favor of HDACs is key not only for oncogenic transformation, but also neurodegeneration. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

If compliance is low, the cystometric filling rate has to be slow in order to obtain a physiologically representative pressure.

5114;2541769;Localized chemical hyperreactivity in supercoiled DNA: evidence for base unpairing in sequences that induce low-salt cruciform extrusion.;Certain A + T-rich DNA sequences (C-type inducing sequences) cause adjacent inverted repeats to undergo cruciform extrusion by a particular pathway (C-type extrusion), which is characterized by large activation energies and extrusion at low salt concentrations and relatively low temperatures. When they are supercoiled, these sequences become reactive toward the normally single-strand-selective reagents bromoacetaldehyde, glyoxal, osmium tetraoxide, and sodium bisulfite. The following evidence is presented: (1) The most reactive sequences are those to the left of the inverted repeat. (2) Chemical reactivity is suppressed by either sodium chloride or micromolar concentrations of distamycin. The suppression of reactivity closely parallels that of C-type cruciform extrusion. (3) Chemical reactivity requires a threshold level of negative supercoiling. The threshold superhelix density depends on the prevailing salt concentration. (4) Analysis of temperature dependences suggests that reaction with osmium tetraoxide involves transient unstacking events, while bromoacetaldehyde requires larger scale helix opening. Thus a variety of opening events may occur in the supercoiled A + T-rich sequences, from small-amplitude breathing to low-frequency, large-amplitude openings. The latter appear to be responsible for C-type cruciform extrusion. ;polythreonine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
5117;25885816;Defective structural RNA processing in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.;Surveillance of integrity of the basic elements of the cell including DNA, RNA, and proteins is a critical element of cellular physiology. Mechanisms of surveillance of DNA and protein integrity are well understood. Surveillance of structural RNAs making up the vast majority of RNA in a cell is less well understood. Here, we sought to explore integrity of processing of structural RNAs in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and other inflammatory diseases. We employed mononuclear cells obtained from subjects with RRMS and cell lines. We used quantitative-PCR and whole genome RNA sequencing to define defects in structural RNA surveillance and siRNAs to deplete target proteins. We report profound defects in surveillance of structural RNAs in RRMS exemplified by elevated levels of poly(A) + Y1-RNA, poly(A) + 18S rRNA and 28S rRNAs, elevated levels of misprocessed 18S and 28S rRNAs and levels of the U-class of small nuclear RNAs. Multiple sclerosis is also associated with genome-wide defects in mRNA splicing. Ro60 and La proteins, which exist in ribonucleoprotein particles and play different roles in quality control of structural RNAs, are also deficient in RRMS. In cell lines, silencing of the genes encoding Ro60 and La proteins gives rise to these same defects in surveillance of structural RNAs. Our results establish that profound defects in structural RNA surveillance exist in RRMS and establish a causal link between Ro60 and La proteins and integrity of structural RNAs. ;polyalanine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

The case of polyglycine, polyalanine, and poly-alpha-aminoisobutyric acid in vacuo.;"Fully quantum mechanical calculations exploiting periodic boundary conditions (PBC) have been applied to the study of four different regular structures (alpha- and 3(10)-helix, fully extended and repeated gamma-turns) of the infinite polypeptides of glycine, alanine, and alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) in vacuo. alpha-Helix is predicted to be the most stable conformer for polyalanine and polyglycine, being stabilized over the 3(10)-helix mainly by more favorable dipole-dipole interactions. Contrary to previous suggestions, steric effects and hydrogen-bond strengths are comparable for both helix structures. 3(10)-Helix is preferred for poly-Aib, since in this case alpha-helix is strongly distorted due to unfavorable intrachain repulsions. Extended structures and repeated gamma-turns are much less stable than helix structures for all of the polypeptides examined, mainly due to the absence of favorable long-range interactions. The optimized geometries are in good agreement with the available experimental data and reveal a remarkable dependence on the nature of the residue forming the polypeptides; at the same time the electronic and structural parameters of each residue strongly depend on the secondary structure of the polypeptides.

This report presents the 2754-nucleotide (nt) sequence of a HindIII restriction fragment containing pcaD, the 801-bp gene encoding beta-ketoadipate enol-lactone hydrolase I. The deduced primary structure of A. calcoaceticus PcaD shares 44% amino acid (aa) sequence identity with the aligned primary structure of CatD (beta-ketoadipate enol-lactone hydrolase II) from the same organism, and the overall nt sequence identity of the two genes is 51.8%. In the 56% of the genes where selection for identical aa residues was not imposed, pcaD and catD have diverged so extensively that nt sequence identity of the aligned segments is only 28.2%; the G+C contents of these segments from the respective genes differ by 8%. Conserved within the aligned PcaD and CatD aa sequences is a Ser residue corresponding to the nucleophile within the alpha/beta-fold of many hydrolytic enzymes. In this region of primary structure, PcaD and CatD appear to have maintained some different aa sequences derived from a common ancestor. Conservation of the different aa sequences during extreme evolutionary divergence suggests that separate segments of primary structure, conserved within either PcaD or CatD, may be functionally incompatible within recombinant enzymes. Consequently, selection for avoidance of genetic exchange between pcaD and catD could account for the thorough nt substitution in regions where identical aa were not selected. Sequence repetitions within pcaD suggest that the multiple mutations required for its extensive divergence from catD were achieved in part by acquisition of a complex DNA slippage structure.";-;-;-;hard_0

Studies were conducted in anesthetized, paralyzed, ventilated rats, with blood gases controlled and AP maintained in the autoregulated range. Electrolytic lesions were placed unilaterally in the BF at the level of the lateral preoptic region lying in rostral portions of the medial forebrain bundle and resulted in a reduction of up to 47% of the choline acetyltransferase activity in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex. rCBF was measured in homogenates of 9 paired brain regions by the 14C-iodoantipyrine technique. In unlesioned rats, FN stimulation symmetrically and significantly (P less than 0.05) increased rCBF in all brain regions with the greatest increase (to 180%) in the frontal cortex. Two days following a unilateral BF lesion, FN stimulation failed to increase rCBF in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex distal to the BF lesion. In contrast, rCBF was increased to an almost comparable degree in the remainder of the brain. BF lesions alone resulted in a 18-23% reduction in cortical rCBF ipsilaterally (P less than 0.025). BF lesions did not alter the cerebrovascular vasodilation elicited by CO2 nor perturb autoregulation. The cortical vasodilation elicited by FN stimulation is mediated by intrinsic neuronal pathways and depends upon the integrity of neurons, possibly cholinergic, originating in, or passing through, the BF.;-;-;-;hard_0
5146;2026146;Chloroplast mRNA 3' end processing requires a nuclear-encoded RNA-binding protein.;The protein coding regions of plastid mRNAs in higher plants are generally flanked by 3' inverted repeat sequences. In spinach chloroplast mRNAs, these inverted repeat sequences can fold into stem-loop structures and serve as signals for the correct processing of the mature mRNA 3' ends. The inverted repeat sequences are also required to stabilize 5' upstream mRNA segments, and interact with chloroplast protein in vitro. To dissect the molecular components involved in chloroplast mRNA 3' end processing and stability, a spinach chloroplast protein extract containing mRNA 3' end processing activity was fractionated by FPLC and RNA affinity chromatography. The purified fraction consisted of several proteins and was capable of processing the 3' ends of the psbA, rbcL, petD and rps14 mRNAs. This protein fraction was enriched for a 28 kd RNA-binding protein (28RNP) which interacts with both the precursor and mature 3' ends of the four mRNAs. Using specific antibodies to this protein, the poly(A) RNA-derived cDNA for the 28RNP was cloned and sequenced. The predicted amino acid sequence for the 28RNP reveals two conserved RNA-binding domains, including the consensus sequences RNP-CS1 and CS2, and a novel acidic and glycine-rich N-terminal domain. The accumulation of the nuclear-encoded 28RNP mRNA and protein are developmentally regulated in spinach cotyledons, leaves, root and stem, and are enhanced during light-dependent chloroplast development. The general correlation between accumulation of the 28RNP and plastid mRNA during development, together with the result that depletion of the 28RNP from the chloroplast protein extract interferes with the correct 3' end processing of several chloroplast mRNAs, suggests that the 28RNP is required for plastid mRNA 3' end processing and/or stability. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
5147;9271364;Roles of NO and Ca2+-activated K+ channels in coronary vasodilation induced by 17beta-estradiol in ischemic heart failure.;Estrogen induces the generation of nitric oxide (NO) and produces coronary vasodilation by opening the Ca2+-activated K+ (K[Ca]) channels. The hypothesis that 17beta-estradiol produces NO and activates K(Ca) channels during coronary hypoperfusion was investigated. In open-chest dogs, the left anterior descending coronary artery was perfused through an extracorporeal bypass tube from the left carotid artery. 17beta-Estradiol was infused into the bypass tube for 20 min after coronary blood flow was reduced by partial occlusion of the bypass tube. 17beta-Estradiol increased the difference in NO concentrations between the coronary venous and arterial blood as well as coronary blood flow. The lactate extraction ratio and pH of coronary venous blood were both also increased by 17beta-estradiol, indicating a reduction in myocardial anaerobic metabolism. Whereas the increase in the coronary arteriovenous difference in NO concentration was completely attenuated by N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, an inhibitor of NO synthase), the increase in coronary blood flow induced by 17beta-estradiol was only partially attenuated by L-NAME. The combination of L-NAME and iberiotoxin (a blocker of high-conductance K(Ca) channels) completely abolished the coronary vasodilatory effect of 17beta-estradiol. The data indicate that during coronary hypoperfusion in canine hearts, 17beta-estradiol increases coronary blood flow and improves metabolic dysfunction by increasing NO release and opening K(Ca) channels.;-;-;-;hard_0
5151;22536444;PKCα binds G3BP2 and regulates stress granule formation following cellular stress.;Protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms regulate a number of processes crucial for the fate of a cell. In this study we identify previously unrecognized interaction partners of PKCα and a novel role for PKCα in the regulation of stress granule formation during cellular stress. Three RNA-binding proteins, cytoplasmic poly(A)(+) binding protein (PABPC1), IGF-II mRNA binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3), and RasGAP binding protein 2 (G3BP2) all co-precipitate with PKCα. RNase treatment abolished the association with IGF2BP3 and PABPC1 whereas the PKCα-G3BP2 interaction was largely resistant to this. Furthermore, interactions between recombinant PKCα and G3BP2 indicated that the interaction is direct and PKCα can phosphorylate G3BP2 in vitro. The binding is mediated via the regulatory domain of PKCα and the C-terminal RNA-binding domain of G3BP2. Both proteins relocate to and co-localize in stress granules, but not to P-bodies, when cells are subjected to stress. Heat shock-induced stress granule assembly and phosphorylation of eIF2α are suppressed following downregulation of PKCα by siRNA. In conclusion this study identifies novel interaction partners of PKCα and a novel role for PKCα in regulation of stress granules. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

5154;31824001;Use of the Consistency Check in the Vector Verification Method.;"The consistency check is a type of frequency check in which full use is made of the space group symmetry. It is designed for application to a symmetry map, to a tentative atom map, to the results of superpositions, or to any pseudoelectron-density map. Like the frequency check, its purpose is to aid in the analysis of one of the above maps by assigning a relative weight (relative weight equals the number of other peaks that the given peak is consistent with) to the peaks in these maps. To determine the relative weight, each peak in the map is compared with each of the others to see if it is consistent. Two peaks are considered consistent with each other, if and only if, the set of unique vectors between the two is present in the Patterson map. The method is equivalent to doing a full set of symmetry superpositions at each peak in a symmetry map or a tentative atom map; counting the number of points in the resulting map; and outputting this number at the initial peak position. No assumptions other than that for space group symmetry are required to apply the consistency check to a symmetry map. The resulting map, which has been calculated in a routine fashion directly from the Patterson map, may then be conveniently used as the starting point for the structure analysis of an unknown compound.";-;-;-;hard_0
5155;7723010;Structural studies of HIV-1 Tat protein.;Tat (trans-activator) proteins are early RNA binding proteins regulating lentiviral transcription. These proteins are necessary components in the life cycle of all known lentiviruses, such as the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) or the equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV). Tat proteins are thus ideal targets for drugs intervening with lentiviral growth. The consensus RNA binding motif (TAR, trans-activation responsive element) of HIV-1 is well characterized. Structural features of the 86 amino acid HIV-1, Zaire 2 isolate (HV1Z2) Tat protein in solution were determined by two dimensional (2D) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods and molecular dynamics (MD) calculations. In general, sequence regions corresponded to structural domains of the protein. It exhibited a hydrophobic core of 16 amino acids and a glutamine-rich domain of 17 amino acids. Part of the NH2 terminus, Val4 to Pro14, was sandwiched between these domains. Two highly flexible domains corresponded to a cysteine-rich and a basic sequence region. The 16 amino acid sequence of the core region is strictly conserved among the known Tat proteins, and the three-dimensional fold of these amino acids of HV1Z2 Tat protein was highly similar to the structure of the corresponding EIAV Tat domain. HV1Z2 Tat protein contained a well defined COOH-terminal Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) loop similar to the recently determined decorsin RGD loop. ;polyglutamine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
5156;6288101;Chromatin structure interferes with excision of abnormal bases from DNA.;Cell-free extracts of human lymphoblastoid cells NL3 excised almost all uracil residues from free DNA with misincorporated dUMP, but only about half the uracil residues from nuclei, chromatin and reconstituted chromatin with dUMP-misincorporated DNA. This difference in susceptibility to uracil-DNA glycosylase of free and complexed DNAs was similar to the difference in susceptibility of free and complexed methylated DNAs to 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase. Methylated poly(dA-dT) was also protected by formation of complexes with calf thymus chromosomal proteins. It seems that the nucleosome structure prevents the action of DNA glycosylases. The very high sensitivity of PBS1 phage DNA, which contains uracil as a natural component, in complexes with calf thymus chromosomal proteins as well as in the free form [1] was confirmed. This high sensitivity seems ascribable to the high uracil content of PBS1 DNA. Methylated nucleosome monomers and dimers, and reconstituted nucleosome monomers containing methylated DNA of about 150 bp length, were considerably more resistant to 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase than chromatin reconstituted from methylated DNA of longer chain length. This may be due to the lower proportion of linker regions of free form stretches of the DNA chain in nucleosome oligomers.;-;-;-;hard_0

The clone corresponded to sequence for the -COOH-terminal 117 amino acids of an HLA-ABC alpha-chain. It differed in at least 15 positions from the published HLA-B7 amino acid sequence but in only two residues when compared to the partial HLA-A2 protein sequence, and was identical to the HLA-A3 protein sequence derived from the nucleotide sequence of the gene. It also differed from some published human HLA-ABC sequences by the addition of three extra -COOH-terminal amino acids: cysteine-lysine-valine. The clone may correspond to either the HLA-A1 allele, for which independent sequence information is not available, or to HLA-A2, in which case there are possible explanations for the discrepancies. Comparison of the pHLA-A sequence with genomic HLA sequences suggests variations in splicing at the end of the protein coding region in some HLA-ABC heavy chain genes, and the use of alternative poly(A) addition sites.; polyalanine ;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

The extrajunctional spread of end-plate depolarization induced by acetyl) choline (ACh) applied in the bathing solution was studied on frog (Rana esculenta-skeletal muscle fibers. 2. The characteristics of this spread were determined on sartorius muscles mounted in a chamber where the end-plate free pelvic part was separated by a rubber membrane from the end-plate containing tibial one. There was no change in membrane potential if ACh was applied selectively on the pelvic part, even at a concentration of 10 mmol/l. However, on applying 1 mmol/l ACh on the tibial part, depolarization spreading over to the pelvic part was observed. 3. The peak values of ACh depolarization were not modified by tetrodotoxin (TTX) at a concentration of 32 nmol/l, whereas it was decreased by 35% in the presence of 3.1 mumol/l TTX. 4. ACh depolarization measured on the extrajunctional membrane in the presence of TTX is the result of the electronic spread of end-plate depolarization. The length constant of this spread was about the same as the length constant determined by square pulse analysis. 5. When the generation and propagation of action potentials accompanying ACh depolarization were not blocked either by TTX or Na-free Ringer solution, the depolarization values observed on the pelvic part were slightly higher than what could have been expected on the basis of electrotonic behaviour. 6. The above results imply the absence of ACh receptors from the extrajunctional membrane of twitch fibres. Deviations from the electrotonic spread are due to the action potentials accompanying ACh depolarization.;-;-;-;hard_0

5171;11248025;An initial ATP-independent step in the unwinding of a herpes simplex virus type I origin of replication by a complex of the viral origin-binding protein and single-strand DNA-binding protein.;Using a spectrophotometric assay that measures the hyperchromicity that accompanies the unwinding of a DNA duplex, we have identified an ATP-independent step in the unwinding of a herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) origin of replication, Ori(s), by a complex of the HSV-1 origin binding protein (UL9 protein) and the HSV-1 single-strand DNA binding protein (ICP8). The sequence unwound is the 18-bp A + T-rich segment that links the two high-affinity UL9 protein binding sites, boxes I and II of Ori(s). P1 nuclease sensitivity of Ori(s) and single-strand DNA-dependent ATPase measurements of the UL9 protein indicate that, at 37 degrees C, the A + T-rich segment is sufficiently single stranded to permit the binding of ICP8. Binding of the UL9 protein to boxes I and II then results in the formation of the UL9 protein-ICP8 complex, that can, in the absence of ATP, promote unwinding of the A + T-rich segment. On addition of ATP, the helicase activity of the UL9 protein-ICP8 complex can unwind boxes I and II, permitting access of the replication machinery to the Ori(s) sequences. ;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
5172;30074341;[Research and Implementation of Wood Species Recognition System with Wood Near Infrared Spectral Reflection Features].;"This paper proposes a novel wood species recognition scheme based on the spectral reflection features of wood surface, aiming to address the following three issues in terms of the noise filtering, feature selection and radian’s optimal design . First, noises occur in some bands of wood spectral reflection curve so that these noisy bands should be deleted. Second, the wood spectral band is 350~2 500 nm, which is a 2 150D vector with a spectral sampling interval of 1 nm. Therefore, both noise filtering and feature selection should be performed to wood spectral data. In this paper, to simultaneously and efficiently solve the two problems of feature selection and noise filtering, both a feature selection procedure and a noise filtering procedure are performed by solving the eigenvalues of dispersion matrix. This scheme is novel and produces a good outcome. Third, to make the spectral reflection curves picked up by the spectral instrument have the best pattern recognition information; an optimal design is performed for the indoor radian’s mounting height. The genetic algorithm is used to solve the optimal radian’s height so that the spectral reflection curves have the best classification information for wood species. Therefore, the optimal design scheme for the radian’s mounting height can improve the pattern classification accuracy of the wood species to some extents, which is novel with excellent executive feasibility. Many experiments made with our developed software system on the five ordinary wood species in northeast region of China (i.e., including Betula platyphylla, Populus davidiana, Pinus Sylvestris, Picea jezoensis, Larix gmelinii) are performed for approximately 105 times. It indicates that the overall recognition rate reaches to a good recognition accuracy of 95% for five wood species with an ideal recognition velocity. The selected feature wavelengths by using of our feature selection algorithm based on dispersion matrix are mainly in the near infrared band.";-;-;-;hard_0

We sequenced ~1150-Mb genome at ~40-fold coverage using the Roche 454 GS-FLX and Illumina GAIIx sequencers. The sequences were assembled into contigs with N50 = 1.6 kb (total contig assembly reached to 1024 Mb) and scaffolds with N50 = 14.5 kb. The pearl oyster genome is AT-rich, with a GC content of 34%. DNA transposons, retrotransposons, and tandem repeat elements occupied 0.4, 1.5, and 7.9% of the genome, respectively (a total of 9.8%). Version 1.0 of the P. fucata draft genome contains 23 257 complete gene models, 70% of which are supported by the corresponding expressed sequence tags. The genes include those reported to have an association with bio-mineralization. Genes encoding transcription factors and signal transduction molecules are present in numbers comparable with genomes of other metazoans. Genome-wide molecular phylogeny suggests that the lophotrochozoan represents a distinct clade from ecdysozoans. Our draft genome of the pearl oyster thus provides a platform for the identification of selection markers and genes for calcification, knowledge of which will be important in the pearl industry. ;polythreonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
5178;21362639;Effect of the transposable element environment of human genes on gene length and expression.;Independent lines of investigation have documented effects of both transposable elements (TEs) and gene length (GL) on gene expression. However, TE gene fractions are highly correlated with GL, suggesting that they cannot be considered independently. We evaluated the TE environment of human genes and GL jointly in an attempt to tease apart their relative effects. TE gene fractions and GL were compared with the overall level of gene expression and the breadth of expression across tissues. GL is strongly correlated with overall expression level but weakly correlated with the breadth of expression, confirming the selection hypothesis that attributes the compactness of highly expressed genes to selection for economy of transcription. However, TE gene fractions overall, and for the L1 family in particular, show stronger anticorrelations with expression level than GL, indicating that GL may not be the most important target of selection for transcriptional economy. These results suggest a specific mechanism, removal of TEs, by which highly expressed genes are selectively tuned for efficiency. MIR elements are the only family of TEs with gene fractions that show a positive correlation with tissue-specific expression, suggesting that they may provide regulatory sequences that help to control human gene expression. Consistent with this notion, MIR fractions are relatively enriched close to transcription start sites and associated with coexpression in specific sets of related tissues. Our results confirm the overall relevance of the TE environment to gene expression and point to distinct mechanisms by which different TE families may contribute to gene regulation.;-;-;-;hard_0
5179;26123245;Physiologically relevant factors influence tau phosphorylation by leucine-rich repeat kinase 2.;Hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of tau are observed in multiple neurodegenerative diseases termed tauopathies. Tau has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and parkinsonisms. Some PD patients with mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene exhibit tau pathology. Mutations in LRRK2 are a major risk factor for PD, but LRRK2 protein function remains unclear. The most common mutation, G2019S, is located in the kinase domain of LRRK2 and enhances kinase activity in vitro. This suggests that the kinase activity of LRRK2 may underlie its cellular toxicity. Recently, in vitro studies have suggested a direct interaction between tubulin-bound tau and LRRK2 that results in tau phosphorylation at one identified site. Here we present data suggesting that microtubules (MTs) enhance LRRK2-mediated tau phosphorylation at three different epitopes. We also explore the effect of divalent cations as catalytic cofactors for G2019S LRRK2-mediated tau phosphorylation and show that manganese does not support kinase activity but inhibits the efficient ability of magnesium to catalyze LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of tau. These results suggest that cofactors such as MTs and cations in the cellular milieu have an important impact on LRRK2-tau interactions and resultant tau phosphorylation. ;polyleucine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function

5182;29972781;The RNA-Binding Protein Scp160p Facilitates Aggregation of Many Endogenous Q/N-Rich Proteins.;The RNA-binding protein Scp160p is the yeast homolog of the conserved vigilin protein family. These proteins influence a variety of nuclear and cytoplasmic functions. One of Scp160p's reported roles is to increase translation elongation efficiency in a manner related to codon usage. Thus, it can affect translation speed and co-translational folding of nascent peptides. We used polyglutamine (polyQ) reporters to assess Scp160p's effect on protein synthesis and observed that, in the absence of Scp160p, aggregation of polyQ is reduced and toxicity is abolished. We additionally took a proteomic approach and analyzed the impact of Scp160p on the aggregation of endogenous proteins under normal growth conditions. In the absence of Scp160p, aggregation of many Q/N-rich proteins was reduced. Because aggregation mediated by these regions can be important for the proteins' functions, Scp160p may affect many processes via aggregation of Q/N-rich proteins. ;polyglutamine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
5187;17702765;Muscleblind-like 1 interacts with RNA hairpins in splicing target and pathogenic RNAs.;The MBNL and CELF proteins act antagonistically to control the alternative splicing of specific exons during mammalian postnatal development. This process is dysregulated in myotonic dystrophy because MBNL proteins are sequestered by (CUG)n and (CCUG)n RNAs expressed from mutant DMPK and ZNF9 genes, respectively. While these observations predict that MBNL proteins have a higher affinity for these pathogenic RNAs versus their normal splicing targets, we demonstrate that MBNL1 possesses comparably high affinities for (CUG)n and (CAG)n RNAs as well as a splicing target, Tnnt3. Mapping of a MBNL1-binding site upstream of the Tnnt3 fetal exon indicates that a preferred binding site for this protein is a GC-rich RNA hairpin containing a pyrimidine mismatch. To investigate how pathogenic RNAs sequester MBNL1 in DM1 cells, we used a combination of chemical/enzymatic structure probing and electron microscopy to determine that MBNL1 forms a ring-like structure which binds to the dsCUG helix. While the MBNL1 N-terminal region is required for RNA binding, the C-terminal region mediates homotypic interactions which may stabilize intra- and/or inter-ring interactions. Our results provide a mechanistic basis for dsCUG-induced MBNL1 sequestration and highlight a striking similarity in the binding sites for MBNL proteins on splicing precursor and pathogenic RNAs. ;polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

5193;19470742;Extranuclear coactivator signaling confers insensitivity to tamoxifen.;"Tamoxifen is one of many standard therapeutic options currently available for estrogen receptor-alpha-positive breast cancer patients. Emerging data have suggested that levels of estrogen receptor coregulatory proteins play a significant role in acquiring resistance to antiestrogen action. It has been suggested that high levels of estrogen receptor coactivators and its mislocalization may enhance the estrogen agonist activity of tamoxifen and contribute to tamoxifen resistance. In an effort to understand the impact of nongenomic signaling and its contribution to hormone resistance in a whole-animal setting, we generated a transgenic mouse expressing a cytoplasmic version of proline-, glutamic acid-, and leucine-rich protein-1 (PELP1) mutant defective in its nuclear translocation (PELP1-cyto) and implanted these mice with tamoxifen pellets to assess its responsiveness. We show that mammary glands from these mice developed widespread hyperplasia with increased cell proliferation and enhanced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and AKT as early as 12 weeks of age. Treatment with tamoxifen did not inhibit this hyperplasia; instead, such treatment exaggerated hyperplasia with an enhanced degree of alteration, indicative of hypersensitivity to tamoxifen. Analysis of molecular markers in the transgenic mammary glands from the tamoxifen-treated transgenic mice showed higher levels of proliferation markers proliferating cell nuclear antigen and activated mitogen-activated protein kinase than in untreated PELP1-cyto cell-derived mice. We also found that nude mice with MCF-7/PELP1-cyto cell-derived tumor xenografts did not respond to tamoxifen. Using immunohistochemical analysis, we found that 43% of human breast tumor samples had high levels of cytoplasmic PELP1, which shows a positive correlation between tumor grade and proliferation. Patients whose tumors had high levels of cytoplasmic PELP1 exhibited a tendency to respond poorly to tamoxifen compared with patients whose tumors had low levels of cytoplasmic PELP1. These findings suggest that PELP1 localization could be used as a determinant of hormone sensitivity or vulnerability. The establishment of the PELP1-cyto transgenic mouse model is expected to facilitate the development of preclinical approaches for effective intervention of breast tumors using cytoplasmic coregulators and active nongenomic signaling.

5194;9722505;Glutamine-rich domains activate transcription in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.;"Activation domains of eukaryotic transcription factors can be classified into at least three distinct types based on their amino acid composition: acidic, proline-rich, and glutamine-rich. Acidic activators, such as yeast GAL4 and GCN4 and herpes simplex virus VP16, have been shown to stimulate transcription in various higher and lower eukaryotic cells. Similarly, proline-rich activators also function in both mammalian and yeast cells. These activators are regarded to possess ""universal"" activating potentials. By contrast, several studies have suggested that glutamine-rich activators such as human Sp1 are active in higher (mammalian) but not lower (yeast) eukaryotic cells. One interpretation is that lower eukaryotic cells lack a critical co-factor necessary for a glutamine-rich domain. This reasoning is counter-intuitive because many native yeast activator proteins contain glutamine-rich domains. Here, we have investigated the activity of a glutamine-rich GAL4-Sp1 domain A (Sp1A) hybrid protein in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that GAL4-Sp1A activated a GAL1-lacZ reporter by more than 200-fold over basal when the reporter was carried on a 2mu vector. The generality of the Sp1A results is supported by our finding that yeast glutamine-rich domains from HAP2 and MCM1 are also transcriptionally active in S. cerevisiae. Interestingly, we found that glutamine-rich domains are considerably less potent when responsive promoters (i.e. GAL1-lacZ) are integrated into yeast chromosome. Thus our results segregate the inherent transcriptional activity of a glutamine-rich domain in yeast S. cerevisiae from its apparent lack of activity when assayed on chromosomally embedded promoters.";polyproline;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

Here we show that efflux of two specific poly(A)-rich mRNAs (actin and beta-tubulin) from isolated L-cell nuclei is almost totally dependent on the presence of ATP, while efflux of poly(A)-free histone mRNA (H4, H2B, and H1) also occurs to a marked extent in the absence of this nucleotide. Measurements of temperature dependence of transport rate revealed an activation energy of 56.1 kJ/mol for actin mRNA, while the activation energy for histone-H4-mRNA efflux was in the same range as that found for ATP-induced release of RNA from demembranated nuclei (about 15-20 kJ/mol). Addition of nonhydrolyzable nucleotide analogs of ATP to the in vitro system used for measurement of RNA transport did not result in release of nonhistone mRNA (actin), but enhanced the efflux of H4 mRNA to approximately the same extent as ATP. Although not absolutely required, addition of ATP stimulated the rate of export of histone mRNA about twofold. Only the poly(A)-rich RNA, but not the poly(A)-free RNA, released from isolated nuclei was found to compete with poly(A) for the nuclear envelope mRNA-binding site, indicating the mechanism of transport for both RNA classes to be distinct. Export of both nonhistone and histone mRNA was found to be inhibited by a monoclonal antibody against a p60 nuclear-pore-complex antigen. This antibody had no effect on the nucleoside triphosphatase, mediating transport of poly(A)-rich mRNA. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
5197;8663276;ATP and SH3 binding sites in the protein kinase of the large subunit of herpes simplex virus type 2 of ribonucleotide reductase (ICP10).;The large subunit of herpes simplex virus type 2 ribonucleotide reductase (ICP10) is a multifunctional protein. It consists of a ribonucleotide reductase and a serine/threonine protein kinase (PK) domain, which has three proline-rich motifs consistent with SH3-binding sites at positions 140, 149, and 396. We used site-directed mutagenesis to identify amino acids required for kinase activity and interaction with signaling proteins. Mutation of Lys176 or Lys259 reduced PK activity (5-8-fold) and binding of the 14C-labeled ATP analog rho-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl 5'-adenosine (FSBA) but did not abrogate them. Enzymatic activity and FSBA binding were abrogated by mutation of both Lys residues, suggesting that either one can bind ATP. Mutation of Glu209 (PK catalytic motif III) virtually abrogated kinase activity in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ ions, suggesting that Glu209 functions in ion-dependent PK activity. ICP10 bound the adaptor protein Grb2 in vitro. Mutation of the ICP10 proline-rich motifs at positions 396 and 149 reduced Grb2 binding 20- and 2-fold, respectively. Binding was abrogated by mutation of both motifs. Grb2 binding to wild type ICP10 was competed by a peptide for the Grb2 C-terminal SH3 motif, indicating that it involves the Grb2 C-terminal SH3.;polyproline;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
5199;6139171;Inhibition of Ca2+-dependent protein kinase and Ca2+/Mg2+-ATPase in cardiac sarcolemma by the anti-calmodulin drug calmidazolium.;Sarcolemma (SL) vesicles, isolated from pig heart, contain both a Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM-PK) and a Ca2+-dependent Mg2+-ATPase (Ca2+/Mg2+)-ATPase). Some of their properties have been compared: their affinity for Ca2+ ions, dependence on exogenous calmodulin (CaM) and sensitivity to the anti-CaM drug calmidazolium (R24571). The properties of Ca2+-CaM-dependent brain phosphodiesterase (PDE) have also been examined. R24571 appeared to be the most potent inhibitor from brain PDE. For the three enzymes studied, exogenously added CaM was able to antagonize the R24571 inhibition, although the efficiency to counteract was rather low in the case of the SL Ca2+/Mg2+-ATPase. R24571 decreased the affinity of the Ca2+/Mg2+-ATPase for Ca2+ ions (KCa 0.35 versus 0.75 microM) and exerted an inhibition non-competitive with Ca2+ ions on the other CaM-dependent enzymes. Membrane-bound CaM, which is involved in controlling the Ca2+/Mg2+-ATPase, appeared to be present in a stoichiometry varying from 1:1 to 1:4 compared to the 32P-intermediate of the ATPase. R24571 treatment of SL vesicles selectively solubilized a number of proteins in the molecular range of 13-20 kD, which may include CaM. The results suggest that different mechanisms are involved in the CaM control of the two SL enzymes studied.;-;-;-;hard_0

Like many chloroplast mRNAs, the spinach petD mRNA contains a 3'UTR stem-loop structure that determines correct 3' processing of the pre-mRNA and stability of the mature mRNA. RNA-protein interactions with this structure may be involved in the regulation of petD mRNA processing and/or stability. In this report, a spinach chloroplast 41 kD protein has been identified as a component of the petD mRNA 3'stem-loop:protein complex. The 41 kD protein has been purified and four internal peptide sequences were obtained. Based on the peptide sequences, a 585 bp fragment was amplified from a spinach cDNA library by PCR. And, a 1404 bp cDNA clone was then isolated by using the initial PCR fragment as probe. Nucleic acid sequence analysis of the cDNA clone identified an ORF encoding a predicted 36 kD mature protein. An apparent N-terminal transit peptide in the coding region and a 3' poly(A) tail exist in the cDNA clone indicated that this chloroplast protein as nuclear encoded. The mature protein was expressed in E. coli, and the expressed product with a molecular mass of 41 kD was purified. A gel mobility shift assay demonstrated that the expressed 41 kD protein interacts with the petD mRNA 3' UTR to form an RNA-protein complex.; polyalanine ;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
5208;8181061;Epigenetic regulation of the maize Spm transposable element: novel activation of a methylated promoter by TnpA.;Spm is epigenetically inactivated by C-methylation near its transcription start site. We have investigated the interaction between TnpA, an autoregulatory protein that can reactivate a silent Spm, and the promoter of the element. The promoter undergoes rapid de novo methylation and inactivation in stably transformed plants, but only if it includes a GC-rich sequence down-stream of the promoter. TnpA activates the inactive, methylated promoter and leads to reduced methylation. By contrast, TnpA represses the active, unmethylated Spm promoter. Only the internal DNA-binding and dimerization domains of the protein are required for repression, while activation requires an additional C-terminal sequence. TnpA is therefore a unique regulatory protein with a conventional transcriptional repressor activity and a novel ability to activate a methylated, inactive promoter. ;polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
5211;1620316;Informed consent: is it a myth?;"The issue of informed consent at it relates to neurosurgical professional malpractice liability and litigation has been of concern for 20 years or more. The problem persists, and the subject has been addressed by providing patient education with full disclosure regarding neurosurgical procedures. In the process of imparting informed consent, the authors studied the effectiveness of specific neurosurgical health care teaching. One hundred six persons undergoing anterior cervical fusion or lumbar laminectomy were instructed by a neurosurgeon and clinical nurse specialist with a master's degree in neurosurgery. Written testing was performed in each case immediately after a formal teaching session before surgery. Questions were simple and covered only four general topics: 1) diagnosis and surgical techniques; 2) operative risks; 3) postoperative care; and 4) goals and benefits relating to surgery. The mean score on testing immediate retention of information revealed a 43.5% overall performance rate. When patients were tested approximately 6 weeks later, the score dropped to 38.4%. This was statistically significant (chi 2, P less than 0.05). The authors encourage the concept of patient education. The data in the current study, however, suggest that the reasonable and prudent neurosurgeon making a concerted effort at patient education, with the assistance of a professional educator, cannot necessarily expect accurate patient or family recall or comprehension.

5214;7981219;Costabilization of peptide and RNA structure in an HIV Rev peptide-RRE complex.;An arginine-rich peptide corresponding to amino acids 34-50 of the human immunodeficiency virus Rev protein has been shown to bind specifically to its RNA-binding site (RRE) when the peptide is in an alpha-helical conformation. Mutation of any one of six amino acids (Thr34, Arg35, Arg38, Arg39, Asn40, or Arg44) was shown to strongly decrease specific RNA-binding affinity in vitro, suggesting that these residues may contact specific bases or distinct structural features of the RNA. We now show that the four arginine side chains, and not just their charge, are important for specific binding in vivo, and present evidence that three additional arginines (Arg46, Arg48, and Arg50) may make electrostatic contacts to the RRE. RNA-binding specificity of the Rev peptide is temperature-dependent in vitro, correlating with alpha-helix unfolding. Circular dichroism experiments indicate that the peptide helical structure is stabilized when bound specifically to the RRE and that the RNA undergoes a conformational change upon binding. Because the structures of the peptide and RNA in this model system appear to be mutually stabilized upon binding, it is suggested that the entire complex may be viewed as a single folding unit. ;polyarginine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
5216;3160834;Immunopurification and characterization of a neuronal heparan sulfate proteoglycan.;We have identified a unique heparan sulfate (HeS) proteoglycan synthesized by the neuronal-like cell line PC12. The proteoglycan, purified with monoclonal antibodies from medium conditioned by PC12 cells, has an apparent molecular weight of 350,000, and it contains a Mr 80,000 core protein and HeS side chains of Mr 15,000 each. The purified molecule has the same apparent size and density as it has in conditioned medium. HeS proteoglycans that are indistinguishable antigenically but very difficult to solubilize are found on the external surface and in the interior of PC12 cells and neurons. Mild proteolysis converts the surface proteoglycan into a molecule closely resembling that found in the medium. The same surface antigens are also present on a subpopulation of T-cells and on a non-neuronal accessory cell found in dorsal root ganglion cultures. The PC12 cell line and the non-neuronal dorsal root ganglion cells secrete a factor into medium that, after adsorption to polylysine-coated surfaces, induces rapid neurite out-growth by primary sympathetic neurons. The monoclonal antibodies used to purify the neuronal HeS proteoglycan from PC12 cells are capable of depleting this conditioned medium of its neurite-promoting activity. These studies suggest that a HeS proteoglycan synthesized and secreted by neurons and certain accessory cells plays a role in regulating neurite outgrowth. ;polylysine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

The LC-MS separation was performed on a reversed phase column (L-column ODS; 150 mm x 4.6-mm i.d.) using a gradient mobile phase system of 100mM ammonium acetate for 1 min then linear ramps to 100mM ammonium acetate including 40% acetonitrile at 20 min. Extraction was conducted by solid-phase extraction using a Sep-pak C18 cartridge. The drugs were eluted with 2 mliters of 40% acetonitrile in 100 mM ammonium acetate, pH3 (adjusted with acetic acid), from the cartridge. A 50-microL volume of the eluate was injected into the LC-MS. The recoveries by this extraction were 88 to 99%. The mass spectra of methamphetamine, amphetamine, ephedrine, methylephedrine, morphine, 6-acetylmorphine, cocaine, and benzoylecgonine showed the quasi-molecular [M + H]+ ion as the base peak, whereas morphine-3-glucuronide and morphine-6-glucuronide showed [MH-glucuronide]+ ion as the base peak. The calibration graphs were linear and reproducible. Detection limits of these drugs ranged from 2 to 40 ng/mliters by selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode and from 50 to 400 ng/mliters by scan mode.

The groove defines a flexible, hydrophobic environment that is likely to contribute to the structural plasticity necessary for SRP to bind signal sequences of different lengths and amino acid sequence.

5225;9748284;The N-terminal methionine is a major determinant of the DNA binding specificity of MEF-2C.;"Members of the MEF-2 family of transcriptional regulators positively modulate the activity of basic helix-loop-helix proteins in both myogenic and neurogenic cell lineages. Previous work had shown that MEF-2C(2-117), a protein fragment comprising the dimerization and DNA-binding domains of MEF-2C but lacking the N-terminal methionine, bound to AT-rich DNA sequences with high affinity. MEF-2C(2-117) did not discriminate between different AT-rich sequences. We now report the in vitro DNA binding properties of a MEF-2C fragment containing the N-terminal methionine. Measurements of the apparent dissociation constants of the complexes of GG-MEF-2C(1-117) revealed that different AT-rich sequences are bound with different affinities; in particular MEF site containing DNA (CTATAAATAG) is bound preferentially to DNA containing a SRF site (CATAAATG). Strikingly, when the shorter AT run consisted of six alternating thymines and adenines, almost wild-type affinity was observed. Irrespective of the particular DNA sequence, all circular dichroism spectra of the DNA complexes of GG-MEF-2C(1-117) were superimposable and characterized by an identical maximal ellipticity at 269.5 nm, suggesting similar DNA conformations. Bending analysis by circular permutation assay revealed that on complex formation MEF-2C(2-117) induced cognate DNA to bend by 49 degrees, while heterologous DNA remained unbent. In the presence of the N-terminal methionine, however, all DNA sequences were bent by 70 degrees. The above results suggest an important function for the N-terminal methionine in properly orientating MEF-2C on the DNA.";polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

5230;7590244;The 160-kD subunit of human cleavage-polyadenylation specificity factor coordinates pre-mRNA 3'-end formation.;Cleavage-polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) is a multisubunit protein that plays a central role in 3' processing of mammalian pre-mRNAs. CPSF recognizes the AAUAAA signal in the pre-mRNA and interacts with other proteins to facilitate both RNA cleavage and poly(A) synthesis. Here we describe the isolation of cDNAs encoding the largest subunit of CPSF (160K) as well as characterization of the protein product. Antibodies raised against the recombinant protein inhibit polyadenylation in vitro, which can be restored by purified CPSF. Extending previous studies, which suggested that 160K contacts the pre-mRNA, we show that purified recombinant 160K can, by itself, bind preferentially to AAUAAA-containing RNAs. While the sequence of 160K reveals similarities to the RNP1 and RNP2 motifs found in many RNA-binding proteins, no clear match to a known RNA-binding domain was found, and RNA recognition is therefore likely mediated by a highly diverged or novel structure. We also show that 160K binds specifically to both the 77K (suppressor of forked) subunit of the cleavage factor CstF and to poly(A) polymerase (PAP). These results provide explanations for previously observed cooperative interactions between CPSF and CstF, which are responsible for poly(A) site specification, and between CPSF and PAP, which are necessary for synthesis of the poly(A) tail. Also supporting a direct role for 160K in these interactions is the fact that 160K by itself retains partial ability to cooperate with CstF in binding pre-mRNA and, unexpectedly, inhibits PAP activity in in vitro assays. We discuss the significance of these multiple functions and also a possible evolutionary link between yeast and mammalian polyadenylation suggested by the properties and sequence of 160K.; polyalanine ;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
5231;16472769;Two GC-rich boxes in huC promoter play distinct roles in controlling its neuronal specific expression in zebrafish embryos.;HuC, a vertebrate ortholog of Drosophila elav gene, encodes an RNA binding protein and is involved in early neurogenesis. Zebrafish huC is expressed in distinct neurons, including Rohon-Beard (RB) sensory neurons, interneurons and motoneurons, during primary neurogenesis, and in all neurons later during secondary neurogenesis. In this study, we identify two GC-rich box elements, proximal GC (p-GC) box from -172 to -149 and distal GC (d-GC) box from -218 to -208, in zebrafish huC promoter. Using transgenic approach, we demonstrate that deletion of the p-GC box from the promoter results in loss of expression of the reporter GFP in neurons while deletion of the d-GC box leads to GFP expression only in dorsal RB sensory neurons. These results suggest that the p-GC box alone confers transcriptional activity of huC promoter in primary RB neurons and the d-GC is required for huC transcription in the full spectrum of spinal cord neurons. Further studies are needed to identify specific Sp1-like transcription factors that bind to these GC boxes and activate huC transcription. ;polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

MEF from Balb/c and C57BL mice were more susceptible to MCMV than those from C3H and CBA mice. This was evident regardless of whether replication was measured by cytopathic effect (c.p.e.) score, virus yield, plaque count, plaque size or time of onset of c.p.e. The growth of MCMV in tracheal organ cultures from different mouse strains was similar to that observed in MEF from these strains. The replication in MEF when measured by c.p.e. score and virus yield was affected by the density of the cell cultures. The strain of mouse used to produce MCMV also affected the comparative sensitivity of MEF to the virus. This appeared to be due to reduced growth of MCMV in its homologous MEF type, an unexpected result. In contrast, cell density had little effect on the replication of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), but again the in vitro susceptibility of MEF reflected the in vivo susceptibility of mouse strains to infection with this virus.;-;-;-;hard_0

The intrahepatic branches of the portal vein were found to delineate the subdivision of the liver into lobes, segments and subsegments which correspond to the 'mirror image' of the normal liver. The arterial irrigation derives from the mirror image constituting peculiar patterns in each of the specimens. In the first specimen, the left hepatic artery irrigates the superior subsegments of the right lobe, which depends on the right branch of the portal vein. In the second specimen, a voluminous anastomotic intrahepatic channel was noted between the right hepatic artery and the subsegmental posterior inferior branch of the left hepatic artery.

The majority of alcoholics with chronic hepatitis C virus infection displayed virus-related histological changes very similar to those in chronic hepatitis C, including frequent lymphoid follicles (34.7%) or aggregates (93.3%) in the portal tracts, mild necroinflammatory change (76.1%) in the parenchyma, and lymphocytosis in sinusoids (83.7%). Liver cell dysplasia and irregular regenerative activity of hepatocytes were rarely observed. The effects of alcohol on the liver were found to be minimal in the majority. These findings could suggest that the hepatic injury in the majority of alcoholics with chronic hepatitis C virus infection in Japan is due to persistent hepatitis C virus infection rather than to alcoholic injury. In addition, our study disclosed that the perivenular fibrosis which is designated as a histological characteristic of alcoholic liver disease is frequently observed in chronic hepatitis C.

5237;25679350;The functional roles of the three copper sites associated with the methionine-rich insert in the multicopper oxidase CueO from E. coli.;"CueO from Escherichia coli is a multicopper oxidase (MCO) involved in copper tolerance under aerobic conditions. It features the four typical copper atoms that act as electron transfer (T1) and dioxygen reduction (T2, T3; trinuclear) sites. In addition, it displays a methionine- and histidine-rich insert that includes a helix that blocks physical access to the T1 site. In crystalline form, the insert provides at least three additional Met-rich Cu(I) binding sites Cu5 (sCu), Cu6 and Cu7 that are proposed to facilitate rapid oxidation of bound Cu(I) to Cu(II) (S. K. Singh, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 2011, 43, 37849-37857). The activities of variants featuring mutations at sites Cu5 (D360M, M355LD360N), Cu6 (M358,362S), Cu7 (M364,368S) and Cu6,7 (M358,362,364,368S) were compared to that of the wild type form using three different air-stable model substrates (2,6-dimethoxyphenol, [Cu(I)(Bca)2](3-) and Cu(I)Cu(II)-PcoC, a periplasmic Cu(I) binding protein from E. coli). The results demonstrate that the three copper sites play related but distinct roles in CueO oxidase activities. The internal Cu5 site is part of the essential electron transfer pathway connecting surface-exposed sites Cu6 and Cu7 to site T1. Both Cu6 and Cu7 are dominant substrate-docking-oxidation (SDO) sites on the protein surface. However, under physiologically relevant conditions, the SDO function of Cu6 relies largely on an electron transfer pathway via Cu7 to Cu5. These Met-rich sites in CueO provide a robust cuprous oxidase function for control of Cu(I) toxicity. ";polyhistidine;helix;-;LCR_with_function

5244;8532536;Identification of a novel TGF-beta-regulated gene encoding a putative zinc finger protein in human osteoblasts.;The TGF-beta family of growth factors has been extensively studied and found to play major roles in bone physiology and disease. A novel, TGF-beta-inducible early gene (TIEG) in normal human fetal osteoblasts (hFOB) has been identified using differential-display PCR. Using this differentially expressed cDNA fragment of TIEG to screen a hOB cDNA library, a near full-length cDNA for this gene was isolated. Northern analyses indicated that the steady-state levels of the 3.5 kb TIEG mRNA increased within 30 min of TGF-beta treatment of human osteoblasts and reached a maximum of 10-fold above control levels at 120 min post-treatment. This regulation was independent of new protein synthesis. Computer sequence analyses indicates that TIEG mRNA encodes for a 480 amino-acid protein. The TIEG protein contains three zinc finger motifs, several proline-rich src homology-3 (SH3) binding domains at the C-terminal end, and is homologous in this region to the zinc finger-containing transcription factor family of genes. A growth factor/cytokine-specific induction of TIEG has been shown. TIEG expression in hFOB cells was highly induced by TGF-beta and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), with a moderate induction by epidermal growth factor (EGF), but no induction by other growth factors/cytokines was observed. In addition to osteoblastic cells, high levels of TIEG expression were detected in skeletal muscle tissue, while low or no detectable levels were found in brain, lung, liver or kidney. Because TIEG is an early induced putative transcription factor gene, and shows a growth factor induction and tissue specificity, its protein product might play an important role as a signalling molecule in osteoblastic cells. ;polyproline;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

The resulting free energies show that only Ala and Glu- prove to be helix stabilizing, while all other side chains are neutral or destabilizing. This agrees with results from studies of alanine-rich peptide modela, but not the previous Glu-Lys block oligomers in which Leu and Met also stabilize helix. The helix propensity scale derived from the previous block oligomers correlated well with the frequencies of occurrence of different side chains in helical sequences of proteins, whereas the values from the present series do not.

The analyses of plasma and erythrocyte samples require a very sensitive method relative to physiological concentrations and rigorous sampling conditions in order to achieve accurate results. In the cases reported in the literature, total oxypurine levels (hypoxanthine + xanthine) have been generally measured in plasma and urine by an enzymatic spectrophotometric method. In our studies, using HPLC, we found that xanthine is the major oxypurine compound in plasma and urine samples from patients with xanthinuria. In erythrocytes, a biological sample which has not been analysed up to now, we found that xanthine is present at high concentrations whereas it is not detectable in erythrocytes from healthy subjects.;-;-;-;hard_0
5249;24728567;Computational identification of novel microRNAs and targets in Glycine max.;Plant miRNAs, the endogenous non-coding small RNAs of about 20-24 nucleotides, play important roles in multiple biological processes by acting as negative regulators of their targeted mRNAs. Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) is one of the important oil crops of the world, in which many miRNAs have been obtained through the computational prediction or experiments. However, the miRNA genes identified for soybean are still far from saturation, and their biological functions are largely unknown. Here, a total of 48 candidates of miRNAs were identified following a range of strict filtering criteria. Detailed sequence analysis showed that G. max pre-miRNAs vary in length from 47 to 380 nt, embody mature miRNAs that differ in their physical location within the pre-miRNAs. In this study, twenty miRNAs were confirmed by microarray and three miRNAs were further validated by poly(A)-tailed RT-PCR. Comparative sequence analysis of soybean miRNA sequences showed that uracil is the dominant base in the first position at the 5' end of the mature miRNAs, and the base may have an important functional role in miRNA biogenesis and/or miRNA-mediated gene regulation. Finally, we predicted potential targets of these miRNAs. These target genes were predicted to encode transcription factors, resistance protein, heat shock protein, protein kinase, transporter, zinc finger protein and others, which might play important roles in soybean development and stress response.  ;polyalanine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
5253;27282379;Comparative expression patterns and diagnostic efficacies of SR splicing factors and HNRNPA1 in gastric and colorectal cancer.;Serine/arginine-rich splicing factors (SRSFs) and HNRNPA1 have oncogenic properties. However, their proteomic expressions and practical priority in gastric cancer (GC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) are mostly unknown. To apply SFs in clinics, effective marker selection and characterization of properties in the target organ are essential. We concurrently analyzed SRSF1, 3, and 5-7, and HNRNPA1, together with the conventional tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), in stomach and colorectal tissue samples (n = 420) using semiquantitative immunoblot, subcellular fractionation, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction methods. In the semiquantitative immunoblot analysis, HNRNPA1 and SRSF7 levels were significantly higher in GC than in gastric normal mucosa, and SRSF7 levels were higher in intestinal-type compared with diffuse-type of gastric adenocarcinoma. Of the SFs, only HNRNPA1 presented greater than 50 % upregulation (cancer/normal mucosa > 2-fold) incidences and CEA-comparable, acceptable (>70 %) detection accuracy (74 %) for GC. All SF protein levels were significantly higher in CRC than in colorectal normal mucosa, and HNRNPA1 levels were higher in low-stage CRC compared with high-stage CRC. Among the SFs, HNRNPA1 and SRSF3 presented the two highest upregulation incidences (88 % and 74 %, respectively) and detection accuracy (90 % and 84 %, respectively) for CRC. The detection accuracy of HNRNPA1 was comparable to that of CEA in low (≤ II)-stage CRC but was inferior to that of CEA in high (>II)-stage CRC. Extranuclear distributions of HNRNPA1 and SRSF6 (cytosol/microsome) differed from those of other SRSFs (membrane/organelle) in both cancers. In an analysis of the six SF mRNAs, all mRNAs presented unacceptable detection accuracies (≤70 %) in both cancers, and all mRNAs except SRSF6 were disproportionate to the corresponding protein levels in GC. Our results provide a comprehensive insight into the six SF expression profiles in GC and indicate that, among the SFs, HNRNPA1, but not HNRNPA1 mRNA, is the most effective, novel GC marker. Regardless of the good to excellent detection accuracy of SRSF3 and HNRNPA1 in CRC, the SFs have lower practical priority than CEA, especially for high-stage CRC detection. ;polyarginine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
5254;7899074;Cis- and trans-acting elements determining induction of the genes of the gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) utilization pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.;In S. cerevisiae, gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) induces transcription of the UGA genes required for its utilization as a nitrogen source. Analysis of the 5' region of the UGA1 and UGA4 genes led to the identification of a conserved GC-rich sequence (UASGABA) essential to induction by gamma-aminobutyrate. Alone, this UASGABA element also supported some levels of reporter gene transcription in the presence of gamma-aminobutyrate. To be effective, UASGABA requires two positive-acting proteins that both contain a Cys6-Zn2 type zinc-finger motif, namely pathway-specific Uga3p and pleiotropic Uga35p(Dal81p/DurLp). Further analysis of the UGA4 gene revealed that Gln3p, a global nitrogen regulatory protein containing a GATA zinc-finger domain, is required in order to reach high levels of gamma-aminobutyrate-induced transcription. The Gln3p factor exerts its function mainly through a cluster of 5'-GAT(A/T)A-3'(UASGATA) situated just upstream from UASGABA. The role of Gln3p is less predominant in UGA1 than in UGA4 gene expression. We propose that tight coupling between the UASGABA and UASGATA elements enables the cell to integrate, according to its nitrogen status, the induced expression levels of UGA4.;polycysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function

5262;8663417;Solvent-accessible residues on the metal ion-dependent adhesion site face of integrin CR3 mediate its binding to the neutrophil inhibitory factor.;Neutrophil adhesion-dependent functions such as chemotaxis, spreading, and phagocytosis are inhibited by neutrophil inhibitory factor (NIF), a glycoprotein produced by the hookworm Ancylostoma caninum. The NIF binding site has been localized to the A-domain of integrin CR3 (CD11b/CD18) and shown to be metal-dependent. The recently solved crystal structure of the A-domain from CD11b revealed a putative metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) on the top of the structure. To determine if NIF binds to the A-domain at its MIDAS face, amino acid substitutions involving 24 residues present in surface loops and adjacent helices in the structure were created. The expressed CD11b A-domain and CR3 heterodimers were then tested in a blinded manner for their ability to bind to biotinylated NIF. The solvent-exposed Gly143, Asp149, Glu178-Glu179, and Arg208, all located on the MIDAS face, in close proximity to the metal ion, were involved in CR3-NIF interaction. These data show that the natural integrin antagonist, NIF, binds to CR3 through the MIDAS region and identify putative contact residues in this region that could be targeted therapeutically.;-;-;-;hard_0
5263;7967514;A sensitive multilayer immunoalkaline phosphatase method for detection of P-glycoprotein in leukemic and tumor cells in the bone marrow.;"BACKGROUND
Relatively low levels of the multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein have correlated with poor prognosis in rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, acute myelogenous leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma and breast carcinoma. A sensitive, nonradioactive method, less costly and time-consuming than the present molecular biologic techniques, is desirable for direct measurement of P-glycoprotein in tumor cells versus normal cells.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
We have devised an immunoalkaline phosphatase method using four antibody layers to amplify the primary signal considerably and refined staining conditions to optimize the 'signal-to-noise' ratio. Immunoalkaline phosphatase is preferred to immunoperoxidase for testing leukemic and tumor cells in bone marrow, because it avoids myeloperoxidase staining in myeloblasts and myeloid progenitors that interferes with P-glycoprotein interpretation.


RESULTS
Multilayer immunoalkaline phosphatase detected low levels of P-glycoprotein overexpression, that could not be identified by conventional immunoperoxidase or immunoblot, in a low-resistance (8-fold) cell line with a barely detectable transcript. Our technique also detected increased P-glycoprotein in malignant cells in bone marrow of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (10/11), acute myelogenous leukemia (2/2), lymphoma (1/1), neuroblastoma (7/7), and rhabdomyosarcoma (2/2). Increased P-glycoprotein was not identified at diagnosis in 6 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and two with stage IV and three with stage IVS neuroblastoma that remained relapse-free in the long-term, but was detected in 4 patients with stage IV neuroblastoma and three with rhabdomyosarcoma who ultimately relapsed.


CONCLUSIONS
Our new technique is more sensitive than conventional immunoperoxidase and immunoblot for assaying P-glycoprotein in low-resistance cell lines. It may be potentially applicable for detecting low levels of P-glycoprotein overexpression in leukemic and tumor cells in bone marrow. Early identification of low levels of multidrug resistance may be clinically relevant by allowing poor-prognostic patients to receive alternative therapy.";-;-;-;hard_0
5264;9343233;The N-terminal side of the origin-binding domain of simian virus 40 large T antigen is involved in A/T untwisting.;We investigated the role of the N-terminal side of simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen's origin-binding domain in the initiation of virus DNA replication by analyzing the biochemical activities of mutants containing single point substitutions or deletions in this region. Four mutants with substitutions at residues between 121 and 135 were partially defective in untwisting the A/T-rich track on the late side of the origin but were normal in melting the imperfect palindrome (IP) region on the early side. Deletion of the N-terminal 109 amino acids had no effect on either activity, whereas a longer deletion, up to residue 123, greatly reduced A/T untwisting but not IP melting. These results indicate that the region from residue 121 to 135 is important for A/T untwisting but not for IP melting and demonstrate that these activities are separable. Two point substitution mutants (126PS and 135PL) were characterized further by testing them for origin DNA binding, origin unwinding, oligomerization, and helicase activity. These two mutants were completely defective in origin (form U(R)) unwinding but normal in the other activities. Our results demonstrate that a failure to normally untwist the A/T track is correlated with a defect in origin unwinding. Further, they indicate that some mutants with substitutions in the region from residue 121 to 135 interact with origin DNA incorrectly, perhaps by failing to make appropriate contacts with the A/T-rich DNA.;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
5265;15780972;Two novel arginine/serine (SR) proteins in maize are differentially spliced and utilize non-canonical splice sites.;The serine-arginine (SR)-rich splicing proteins are highly conserved RNA binding nuclear phosphor-proteins that play important roles in both regular and alternative splicing. Here we describe two novel putative SR genes from maize, designated zmRSp31A and zmRSp31B. Both genes contain characteristic RNA binding motifs RNP-1 and RNP-2, a serine/arginine-rich (RS) domain and share significant sequence similarity to the Arabidopsis atRSp31 family of SR proteins. Both zmRSp31A and zmRSp31B produce multiple transcripts by alternative splicing, of which majority of the alternatively spliced transcripts utilize non-canonical splice sites. zmRSp31A and zmRSp31B produce at least six and four transcripts, respectively, of which only one corresponds to the wild type proteins for each gene. All the alternatively spliced transcripts of both the genes, with one exception, are predicted to encode small truncated proteins containing only the RNP-2 domain of their first RNA recognition motif and completely lack the carboxyl terminal RS domain. We provide evidence that some of the alternatively spliced transcripts of both genes are associated with polysomes and interact with the translational machinery. ;polyarginine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
5270;8155783;[A calcium channel in the rat liver inner mitochondrial membrane. Effective diameter and selectivity under various conditions].;The pore with an effective diameter of 6.0 A is a Ca(2+)-channel of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Transport of nonelectrolytes through the pore is inhibited by ruthenium red, a specific Ca2+ transport inhibitor, and by polyanions which bind to the positively charged regions in the pore localized on the outer side of the inner mitochondrial membrane. The selectivity of Ca2+ ion transport into intact mitochondria is due to the binding of Ca2+ ions by the glycoprotein at the mouth of the pore as well as to electrostatic interactions of monovalent cations (electrostatic repulsion) and Cl- ions (strong binding) with the positively charged region of the ion-selective filter of the pore. Under normal conditions SCN- and NO3- ions are transferred through the pore at a high rate. Removal of Mg2+ ions and the rise in pH diminish the electrostatic repulsion of the monovalent cations and Cl- ions from the positively charged region of the pore. Depending on conditions, the pore can function as a monovalent ion transport system or as a mechanism of Cl- ion transfer through the inner mitochondrial membrane.;-;-;-;hard_0

The 2.1-kilobase (kb) cDNA encoded a serine-rich polypeptide of 477 amino acids that was 52% identical to the human protein. Southern and Northern (RNA) blot analyses indicated the presence of a single receptor gene and a single predominant 2.3-kb receptor transcript. Human embryonic kidney fibroblasts, stably transfected with the murine IFN-gamma receptor cDNA, expressed murine IFN-gamma receptors as detected by flow cytometry with either ligand or a receptor-specific monoclonal antibody. Nontransfected cells bound neither ligand nor antibody. Radioligand-binding analysis demonstrated that the transfectants expressed 530,000 murine IFN-gamma receptors per cell and bound murine IFN-gamma with a Ka of 1 x 10(9) M-1. However, despite high-level expression of murine IFN-gamma receptors, the transfected human cells responded only to human and not to murine IFN-gamma as detected by enhancement of major histocompatibility class I antigen expression and induction of antiviral activity. These results thus document the isolation and expression of a full-length murine IFN-gamma receptor cDNA and suggest that additional species-specific components may be necessary to form a biologically active IFN-gamma receptor.;polyserine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

The effects of lesion and housing conditions were investigated in the Morris maze spatial orientation task. Fimbria lesions increased the latency to reach the platform during acquisition in both experiments, which indicates that functional recovery of the Morris maze impairment does not occur in 7 months time. Post-operative impoverishment for 2 weeks or for 7 months reduced the lesion induced deficit in Morris maze acquisition, while it had a more general effect in the trial without platform. Interestingly, the impoverishment effects were not more severe after 7 months, but even less easily detected. These findings are interpreted as if impoverishment effects the reactiveness of animals to external stimuli, which may help the animal to compensate for the lesion-induced-deficit in Morris maze learning.;-;-;-;hard_0
5288;25120063;ARID3B expression in primary breast cancers and breast cancer-derived cell lines.;ARID3B (AT-rich interaction domain 3) is a member of the family of ARID proteins, which constitutes evolutionarily conserved transcription factors implicated in normal development, differentiation, cell cycle regulation and chromatin remodeling. In addition, ARID3B has been linked to cellular immortalization, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumorigenesis. Given the emerging role of ARID3B in tumor development, we examined its expression in primary patient-derived breast cancer samples and breast cancer-derived cell lines. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect ARID3B expression in 63 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) invasive breast cancer samples. In addition, a panel of 6 (estrogen receptor-positive and -negative, ERBB2-positive and -negative) breast cancer-derived cell lines and immortalized non-tumorigenic epithelial breast cells were used for ARID3B expression analysis using RT-PCR. Specific primers and Western blotting were used to detect ARID3B isoforms. Using IHC, nuclear, cytoplasmic and low levels of membranous ARID3B staining were detected in all 63 primary invasive breast tumors. Nuclear ARID3B staining positively correlated with estrogen receptor (ER) status and negatively correlated with tumor grade, mitotic index and ERBB2 status of the patients. Increased nuclear expression of ARID3B was confirmed in breast cancer-derived cell lines expressing ERα. In addition, two out of three ERBB2-positive breast cancer cell lines were found to lack full length ARID3B. Three ARID3B isoforms were found to be present in normal breast epithelial cells as well as in breast cancer cells. We report a positive correlation between ER positivity and nuclear ARID3B expression in primary breast cancers, along with a negative correlation with the ERBB2 status. Very similar correlations were noted in breast cancer-derived cell lines. Since in the recent past ARID3B expression has increasingly been related to cancer-associated proteins and microRNAs, knowledge on ARID3B expression and function may be instrumental for gaining further insight into potentially important cancer-related networks. ;polythreonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

Cell suspensions were analyzed by flow cytometry or plated onto poly-D-lysine-coated culture dishes for either nuclear staining or immunocytochemistry. Experiments on functional Na+ channels and GABAA receptor expression were carried out using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) and a negatively charged fluorescent indicator dye (oxonol). FACS analysis of embryonic cell suspensions at E13-17 consistently revealed one major subpopulation accounting for 85-90% of the events and one minor subpopulation (10-15% of the total). When sorted, the major subpopulation consisted of phase-bright cells of 5-7 microns diameter some of which had neurites. The minor population consisted of phase-dark cells and resealed membranes of 0.5-4 microns diameter as well as debris. Almost all the cells obtained in the high FALS (forward-angle light scatter) subpopulation at E17 expressed 200-kDa neurofilament and tetanus toxin antigens while the small diameter cells seldom expressed tetanus toxin and particles never did. A small number of GABA-containing neurons were detected in the telencephalon at E13 (3%) and in the developing striatum at E14 (6%). All of the GABA-containing neurons expressed neurofilament.

5291;14625308;Sequential autophosphorylation steps in the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 regulate its availability as an adapter in interleukin-1 signaling.;The interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK-1) is an important adapter in the signaling complex of the Toll/interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor family. Formation of the signaling IL-1 receptor complex results in the activation and hyperphosphorylation of IRAK-1, which leads to a pronounced shift of its apparent molecular mass in gel electrophoresis. Presently, the individual residues phosphorylated in IRAK-1 and the consequences for IRAK-1 function are unknown. We define sequential phosphorylation steps in IRAK-1, which are, in vitro, autophosphorylation. First, IRAK-1 is phosphorylated at Thr209. By fluorescence energy transfer experiments, we demonstrate that Thr209 phosphorylation results in a conformational change of the kinase domain, permitting further phosphorylations to take place. Substitution of Thr209 by alanine results in a kinase-inactive IRAK-1. Second, Thr387 in the activation loop is phosphorylated, leading to full enzymatic activity. Third, IRAK-1 autophosphorylates several times in the proline-, serine-, and threonine-rich ProST region between the N-terminal death domain and kinase domain. Hyperphosphorylation of this region leads to dissociation of IRAK-1 from the upstream adapters MyD88 and Tollip but leaves its interaction with the downstream adapter TRAF6 unaffected. This identifies IRAK-1 as a novel type of adapter protein, which employs its own kinase activity to introduce negative charges adjacent to the protein interaction domain, which anchors IRAK-1 at the active receptor complex. Thus, IRAK-1 regulates its own availability as an adapter molecule by sequential autophosphorylation. ;polythreonine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function

We demonstrate that expression of both the E1 and E2 open reading frames are necessary and sufficient for replication of a plasmid construct containing a genomic 291-bp fragment in both cell types. The roles of the E1 and E2 proteins in replication were further examined by overexpressing the gene products in a glutathione-S-transferase bacterial expression system. In addition to a full-length E1 protein, a truncated E1 protein (E1*) which consisted of the amino-terminal 268 aa was synthesized. Both E1 and E1* were found to complex efficiently with the E2 protein in vivo and in vitro. In addition, site-specific DNA binding by both the E2 and E1 proteins to HPV-31b origin containing DNA was observed. The E1* protein, however, failed to bind HPV-31b DNA specifically and could not cooperate with E2 for replication in transient assays. DNase I footprinting demonstrated that the E1 protein of HPV-31b bound to an A/T-rich region (nucleotides 7905-24) which shares similarities with the binding site for the bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) E1 protein.

However, a curvilinear relationship exists: Those with higher caring are respondents who scored both at the highest and the lowest levels of maternal care. Moreover, levels of caring within nursing schools appear to moderate caring ability developed at home. A caring school climate is the strongest predictor of caring ability (r = 0.16, P < .01).

5298;17785442;Human TOB, an antiproliferative transcription factor, is a poly(A)-binding protein-dependent positive regulator of cytoplasmic mRNA deadenylation.;In mammalian cells, mRNA decay begins with deadenylation, which involves two consecutive phases mediated by the PAN2-PAN3 and the CCR4-CAF1 complexes, respectively. The regulation of the critical deadenylation step and its relationship with RNA-processing bodies (P-bodies), which are thought to be a site where poly(A)-shortened mRNAs get degraded, are poorly understood. Using the Tet-Off transcriptional pulsing approach to investigate mRNA decay in mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, we found that TOB, an antiproliferative transcription factor, enhances mRNA deadenylation in vivo. Results from glutathione S-transferase pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicate that TOB can simultaneously interact with the poly(A) nuclease complex CCR4-CAF1 and the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein, PABPC1. Combining these findings with those from mutagenesis studies, we further identified the protein motifs on TOB and PABPC1 that are necessary for their interaction and found that interaction with PABPC1 is necessary for TOB's deadenylation-enhancing effect. Moreover, our immunofluorescence microscopy results revealed that TOB colocalizes with P-bodies, suggesting a role of TOB in linking deadenylation to the P-bodies. Our findings reveal a new mechanism by which the fate of mammalian mRNA is modulated at the deadenylation step by a protein that recruits poly(A) nuclease(s) to the 3' poly(A) tail-PABP complex. ;polyalanine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

Here, we have compared the role and specificity of TBK1 in the type I IFN response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), polyI:C, and viral challenge by examining IRF3 nuclear translocation, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 phosphorylation, and induction of IFN-regulated genes. The LPS and polyI:C-induced IFN responses were abolished and delayed, respectively, in macrophages from mice with a targeted disruption of the TBK1 gene. When challenged with Sendai virus, the IFN response was normal in TBK1(-/-) macrophages, but defective in TBK1(-/-) embryonic fibroblasts. Although both TBK1 and IKK-i are expressed in macrophages, only TBK1 but not IKK-i was detected in embryonic fibroblasts by Northern blotting analysis. Furthermore, the IFN response in TBK1(-/-) embryonic fibroblasts can be restored by reconstitution with wild-type IKK-i but not a mutant IKK-i lacking kinase activity. Thus, our studies suggest that TBK1 plays an important role in the Toll-like receptor-mediated IFN response and is redundant with IKK-i in the response of certain cell types to viral infection. ;polyisoleucine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
5305;9382404;Quantitative synthesis in systematic reviews.;The final common pathway for most systematic reviews is a statistical summary of the data, or meta-analysis. The complex methods used in meta-analyses should always be complemented by clinical acumen and common sense in designing the protocol of a systematic review, deciding which data can be combined, and determining whether data should be combined. Both continuous and binary data can be pooled. Most meta-analyses summarize data from randomized trials, but other applications, such as the evaluation of diagnostic test performance and observational studies, have also been developed. The statistical methods of meta-analysis aim at evaluating the diversity (heterogeneity) among the results of different studies, exploring and explaining observed heterogeneity, and estimating a common pooled effect with increased precision. Fixed-effects models assume that an intervention has a single true effect, whereas random-effects models assume that an effect may vary across studies. Meta-regression analyses, by using each study rather than each patient as a unit of observation, can help to evaluate the effect of individual variables on the magnitude of an observed effect and thus may sometimes explain why study results differ.

5308;7766216;Strategies for circumventing transplant rejection: modification of cells, tissues and organs.;New technologies may permit the therapeutic use of transplanted cells or whole organs to be extended to the treatment of a wider range of diseases and a greater number of individuals. At present, the replacement of failing organs or the treatment of disease by transplantation is restricted by the need for co-administration of toxic immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection, and the limited availability of donor organs. Recent advances, however, suggest that genetically engineered or immunologically modified donor organs or cells can eliminate the need for host immunosuppression and can allow organ and cell survival across species. Transplantation could thus become a widespread therapeutic approach in the next century.;-;-;-;hard_0
5309;19298209;Cytoprotective and antioxidant activity of seabuckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) flavones against tert-butyl hydroperoxide-induced cytotoxicity in lymphocytes.;This study was designed to determine the cytoprotective activity of flavones of seabuckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) against tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tert-BOOH), used as an oxidant to induce oxidative damage, with lymphocytes as the model system. Addition of tert-BOOH (250 microM) to the cells resulted in enhanced cytotoxicity and free radical production. The intracellular calcium levels, caspase activity, and apoptosis were significantly increased following tert-BOOH treatment. Seabuckthorn flavones at the concentration of 100 microg/mL significantly inhibited tert-BOOH-induced cytotoxicity and free radical production and also restored the antioxidant status to that of control cells. Seabuckthorn flavones also significantly restricted tert-BOOH-induced apoptosis by decreasing intracellular calcium levels and caspase activity. The extract also decreased tert-BOOH-induced formation of DNA breaks by 30%. These observations suggest that the flavones of seabuckthorn have marked cytoprotective properties, which could be attributed to the antioxidant activity.;-;-;-;hard_0

An exploratory subanalysis of the ODIN trial was performed to evaluate the efficacy of darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) 800/100 mg OD versus 600/100 mg BID in patients who were NNRTI-experienced but PI-naïve. Methods. ODIN was a phase III, 48-week study comparing DRV/r OD versus BID in 590 treatment-experienced patients with no DRV resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) at screening. Patients received DRV/r 800/100 mg OD or DRV/r 600/100 mg BID plus ≥2 NRTIs. Of the 590 patients randomized, 272 (46%) were NNRTI-experienced but PI-naïve. Results. Overall, 272 patients received DRV/r OD (n = 135) or BID (n = 137) plus ≥2 optimised NRTIs. The mean age was 39 years; 35% were female; 27% were Black, 24% Caucasian, 26% Oriental/Asian, and 23% other races; 17% were recruited in South Africa; and 48% had non-B HIV-1 subtypes. Mean baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA load was 4.10 log10⁡ copies/mL; median CD4 cell count was 258 cells/μL. At week 48, 111/135 (82%) of DRV/r OD and 109/137 (80%) of DRV/r BID patients achieved an HIV-1 RNA load <50 copies/mL. No patient developed primary PI RAMs. Conclusion. DRV/r 800/100 mg OD in combination with ≥2 optimised NRTIs led to virological suppression <50 copies/mL in 82% of NNRTI-experienced, PI-naïve patients by week 48.";-;-;-;hard_0
5313;7509078;Induction of RNA-binding proteins in mammalian cells by DNA-damaging agents.;"A technique to detect RNA-binding proteins (RBP) involving hybridization of RNA probe to proteins transferred to a membrane was used to study RBP in different mammalian cells and in cells after genotoxic stress. With this approach, up to 13 proteins of different sizes were detected in crude nuclear extracts by using a viral RNA probe consisting of the trans-activation-responsive (TAR) element of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The TAR RNA probe contains a stem-loop structure found in nascent HIV-1 transcripts. A G+C-rich probe with similar structure also bound to many of these RBP. Only a 102-kDa protein strongly bound to other RNA probes lacking this structure, while a probe with an A+U-rich stem-loop structure fail to bind most RBP, thus indicating a RNA secondary structure preference. The expression of these RBP varied substantially in nine different human and hamster cell lines, with no detectable RBP in two human myeloid lines. Evidence for induction of these RBP was found in six of seven lines after treatment with DNA-damaging agents; UV radiation was the most effective agent. In Chinese hamster ovary cells, which showed the strongest response, all five RBP present in untreated cells rapidly increased in activity after UV irradiation, and eight additional RBP were detected. The induction of these RBP by DNA-damaging agents indicates one or more possible roles for these proteins in the cellular response to genotoxic stress and in viral activation after such stress.

5316;9741196;[Rhabdomyolysis: clinical features, causes, complications and treatment].;Rhabdomyolysis is a condition affecting body homeostasis that results from impaired supply of muscles with energy, nutritional factors and blood. Complex pathophysiological mechanism causes that extended myolysis may complicate different clinical conditions, such as: crush syndrome, excessive physical effort (work, seizures), toxic effect of drugs and toxins, water-electrolyte disturbances, congenital enzymatic deficiencies etc. It seems that on the cellular level, essential role is played by excessively high intracytoplasmatic calcium level, which affects metabolic processes. So high calcium level is a consequence of muscular cell injury irrespective to its reason. It manifests clinically as muscular weakness, pal and oedema and laboratory tests reveal elevated CK, GOT, GPT, aldolase and LDH levels as well as dark brown urine colour. Demonstration of elevated serum myoglobin level or its presence in urine directly confirms development of rhabdomyolysis. In unfavorable conditions, rhabdomyolysis may result in acute renal failure. Appropriately early and adequate water supply and alkalization plays an essential role in prevention of impairment in renal function. In advanced phase of renal failure, hemodialysis is a standard treatment.;-;-;-;hard_0
5317;33746031;Biotechnological applications of versatile plant lipid transfer proteins (LTPs).;Plant AMPs are usually cysteine-rich, and can be classified in several classes, including lipid transfer proteins (LTPs). LTPs are small plant cationic peptides, and can be classified in two subclasses, LTP1 (9-10 kDa) and LTP2 (7 kDa). They have been identified and isolated from various plant species and can be involved in a number of processes, including responses against several phytopathogens. LTP1 presents 4 parallel α- helices and a 310-helix fragment. These structures form a tunnel with large and small entrances. LTP2 presents 3 parallel α- helices, which form a cavity with triangular structure. Both LTP subclasses present a hydrophobic cavity, which makes interaction with different lipids and general hydrophobic molecules possible. Several studies report a broad spectrum of activity of plant LTPs, including antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antitumoral, and insecticidal activity. Thus, these molecules can be employed in human and animal health as an alternative to the conventional treatment of disease, well as providing the source of novel drugs. However, employing peptides in human health can present challenges, such as the toxicity of peptides, the difference between the results found in in vitro assays and in pre-clinical or clinical tests and their low efficiency against Gram-negative bacteria. In this context, plant LTPs can be an interesting alternative means by which to bypass such challenges. This review addresses the versatility of plant LTPs, their broad spectrum of activities and their potential applications in human and animal health and in agricultural production, and examines challenges in their biotechnological application.;polycysteine;helix;-;LCR_with_function

5319;8751933;Role of lipopolysaccharide in colonization of the mouse intestine by Salmonella typhimurium studied by in situ hybridization.;An avirulent, streptomycin-resistant Salmonella typhimurium strain, SL5319, and its lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-deficient mutant strain, SL5325, differ in their ability to colonize the large intestines of streptomycin-treated mice. When fed to mice independently, the strains colonize equally well, but when fed together, the LPS-deficient mutant is outcompeted by the wild-type strain during establishment in the gut (J.J. Nevola, B.A.D. Stocker, D.C. Laux, and P.S. Cohen, Infect. Immun. 50:152-159, 1985). In the present study, the spatial distribution in the intestinal mucosal layer of the two strains was visualized by specific hybridization to bacterial rRNA in histological sections of mouse colon and cecum. The first day after infection, 9.8% of the smooth SL5319 cells observed in mucus were found to be associated with the mouse epithelial cells, but three days after infection, the corresponding fraction of adhering bacteria was reduced to 2.1%. The LPS-deficient S. typhimurium strain was confined to the part of the mucosal layer closest to the colonic lumen and was not observed to adhere to the epithelium either at day 1 or 3 after infection. Quantitative determinations of the distance from the S. typhimurium cells to the epithelial wall confirmed that the average distance for the rough S. typhimurium SL5325 was much larger than for its smooth counterpart, S. typhimurium SL5319. Quantification of the hybridization signal from bacteria isolated from the cecal mucus revealed that the two strains had the same ribosome concentration, indicating that they have the same potential for growth in the intestinal environment. On the basis of these observations, we suggest that the better colonization ability of the strain carrying wild-type LPS is due to the better abilities to penetrate the intestinal mucosal layer and to subsequently bind to the epithelial cells in vivo.;-;-;-;hard_0
5320;22527206;Pantoprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, delays fracture healing in mice.;Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which are widely used in the treatment of dyspeptic problems, have been shown to reduce osteoclast activity. There is no information, however, on whether PPIs affect fracture healing. We therefore studied the effect of the PPI pantoprazole on callus formation and biomechanics during fracture repair. Bone healing was analyzed in a murine fracture model using radiological, biomechanical, histomorphometric, and protein biochemical analyses at 2 and 5 weeks after fracture. Twenty-one mice received 100 mg/kg body weight pantoprazole i.p. daily. Controls (n = 21) received equivalent amounts of vehicle. In pantoprazole-treated animals biomechanical analysis revealed a significantly reduced bending stiffness at 5 weeks after fracture compared to controls. This was associated with a significantly lower amount of bony tissue within the callus and higher amounts of cartilaginous and fibrous tissue. Western blot analysis showed reduced expression of the bone formation markers bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2, BMP-4, and cysteine-rich protein (CYR61). In addition, significantly lower expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen indicated reduced cell proliferation after pantoprazole treatment. Of interest, the reduced expression of bone formation markers was associated with a significantly diminished expression of RANKL, indicating osteoclast inhibition. Pantoprazole delays fracture healing by affecting both bone formation and bone remodeling. ;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
5325;8765978;High-affinity growth hormone binding protein, insulin-like growth factor I and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 in adults with growth hormone deficiency.;"The high-affinity growth hormone binding protein (GHBP) circulates in human blood and represents the extracellular domain of the growth hormone (GH) receptor. The effects of GH deficiency on GHBP in adults are not clear. The aim of this study was to evaluate serum GHBP levels in adults with GH deficiency and to assess whether GHBP measurement may contribute to the diagnosis of adult GH deficiency, based on a two-step model. We measured insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) and GHBP levels in serum samples of 36 patients with adult-onset GH deficiency. The GHBP levels were measured by FPLC size-exclusion chromatography; IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels were measured by RIA. Serum GHBP levels were elevated above the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval in 26 patients, whereas IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels were low in 10 patients and in 16 patients, respectively. The combination of low serum IGF-I and low IGFBP-3 levels was found in 10 patients. In nine patients, serum IGF-I levels were low, with elevated GHBP levels. Low serum IGF-I, low IGFBP-3 and elevated GHBP levels were found in five patients. Only four out of 36 patients had serum IGF-I, IGFBP-3 and GHBP levels that were within the 95% confidence interval of the control values. We conclude that adults with acquired GH deficiency have elevated GHBP levels in comparison to healthy subjects. We suggest that measurement of GHBP levels might contribute to the diagnosis of adult GH deficiency, though further research is required to study the additional value of GHBP measurements.";-;-;-;hard_0
5326;24882058;Highly sensitive immunoassay based on controlled rehydration of patterned reagents in a 2-dimensional paper network.;We have demonstrated a multistep 2-dimensional paper network immunoassay based on controlled rehydration of patterned, dried reagents. Previous work has shown that signal enhancement improves the limit of detection in 2-dimensional paper network assays, but until now, reagents have only been included as wet or dried in separate conjugate pads placed at the upstream end of the assay device. Wet reagents are not ideal for point-of-care because they must be refrigerated and typically limit automation and require more user steps. Conjugate pads allow drying but do not offer any control of the reagent distribution upon rehydration and can be a source of error when pads do not contact the assay membrane uniformly. Furthermore, each reagent is dried on a separate pad, increasing the fabrication complexity when implementing multistep assays that require several different reagents. Conversely, our novel method allows for consistent, controlled rehydration from patterned reagent storage depots directly within the paper membrane. In this assay demonstration, four separate reagents were patterned in different regions of the assay device: a gold-antibody conjugate used for antigen detection and three different signal enhancement components that must not be mixed until immediately before use. To show the viability of patterning and drying reagents directly onto a paper device for dry reagent storage and subsequent controlled release, we tested this device with the malaria antigen Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) as an example of target analyte. In this demonstration, the signal enhancement step increases the visible signal by roughly 3-fold and decreases the analytical limit of detection by 2.75-fold.  ;polyhistidine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
5329;18061953;Clinical applications and availability of CD4+ T cell count testing in sub-Saharan Africa.;"The absolute CD4+ T cell count in adults and CD4+ T cell percentage of lymphocytes (CD4%) in pediatrics compliment clinical history and physical examination to inform decisions about initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART). In addition, these immunologic markers predict host susceptibility to specific opportunistic infections, selected drug toxicities, and mortality. These benefits argue strongly for the availability of CD4+ T cell testing capacity in all settings where HIV infection is treated. Several currently available flow cytometry-based devices, and novel CD4+ T cell enumeration techniques such as the panleucogating CD4 are especially suitable for resource-constrained settings. At this time, unfortunately, the landscape of HIV care in sub-Saharan Africa is a mosaic characterized by large areas where CD4+ T cell testing capacity is limited or unavailable, and small, but growing, pockets where the capacity exists. Routine HIV quantification is currently unaffordable and unsustainable in the great majority of the region; therefore, a reliance on CD4+ T cell testing is inevitable for now. To this end, correcting the disparities in CD4+ T cell testing capacity and defining the minimum laboratory requirements for the safe use of antiretroviral drugs through well-designed clinical studies are some of the most urgent priorities of the ongoing global scale-up of ART.";-;-;-;hard_0
5336;9365118;Novel lymphocyte-specific CC chemokines and their receptors.;By using a cloning method termed the signal sequence trap as well as by searching for chemokine homologous sequences in the database of expressed sequence tags, cDNA fragments potentially encoding novel CC chemokines were initially identified. Using these sequences, we have cloned five novel human CC chemokines termed TARC, LARC, ELC, SLC, and PARC. These chemokines are constitutively expressed especially in some lymphoid tissues with individually unique expression patterns. The recombinant proteins are all found to be selectively chemotactic for lymphocytes but not for monocytes or neutrophils. Each chemokine appears to interact with a class of receptors on lymphocytes that is not shared by any other chemokines so far tested. Furthermore, we have identified CCR4 as the specific receptor for TARC, GPR-CY4/DRY6/CKR-L3/STRL22 as that for LARC (CCR6), and EBI1/BLR2 as that for ELC (CCR7). Only the gene for PARC is mapped to the traditional CC chemokine gene cluster at chromosome 17q11.2, whereas those for TARC, LARC, ELC, and SLC are localized at different loci. Collectively, these five CC chemokines may constitute a new category of CC chemokines that are involved in trafficking and homing of particular subsets of lymphocytes in particular lymphoid tissue microenvironments.;-;-;-;hard_0

Newborn infants were allocated into two groups: group A: all premature infants (n = 83) of less than or equal to 34 weeks' gestation or less and group B: neonates (n = 36) of more than 34 weeks' gestation presenting with abnormal neurological signs. Group A: the overall incidence of periventricular haemorrhage (PVH) was 47% (15 grade I, 16 grade II, 3 grade III, 1 Plexus choroid haemorrhage, 1 isolated intraventricular haemorrhage). Infants of 30 weeks or less were at highest risk to develop a PVH. The degree of severity did not depend on gestational age. Repeated scans accurately timed the onset of PVH; 67% developed a PVH within the first 24 hours of life and 31% within the first 6 hours. A post-haemorrhagic ventricular dilatation was noted in 50% of the 28 infants who survived more than 28 days (4 transient, 7 arrested and 3 rapidly progressive). Group B: 15 of 36 infants had US abnormalities. Cerebral lesions were miscellaneous. Diagnosis of PVH, leukomalacia, agenesis of corpus callosum, calcifications in the basal ganglia, hydranencephaly were made and confirmed at autopsy in 9 fatal cases.

5340;2828514;Biochemical and biophysical characteristics of Rio Bravo virus (Flaviviridae).;"Rio Bravo (RB) virus has been assigned to the family Flaviviridae on the basis of its antigenic relatedness to other members of this family. RB virus, unlike most members of the Flaviviridae, is believed not to have an arthropod vector. We examined biochemical and biophysical characteristics of RB virus to determine whether it should be assigned to the Flaviviridae and to compare it with arthropod-borne flaviviruses. Purified RB virus banded at a density of 1.18 g/ml in sucrose and had a sedimentation coefficient of about 200 S. Virions, negatively stained with ammonium molybdate, were spherical, had diameters of 42 nm, and appeared to be surrounded by envelopes bearing surface projections. The loss of infectivity after infectious virus was incubated with diethyl ether or sodium deoxycholate confirmed the presence of envelopes. Partially purified RB virions contained single-stranded RNA, lacking 3' poly(A) tracts, that sedimented in a 15% to 30% sucrose gradient as one discrete band with a sedimentation coefficient of about 40 S. Most of the viral proteins in preparations of purified virus and in immunoprecipitates had similar electrophoretic mobilities and glycosylation patterns to known flavivirus proteins. Therefore, they were assigned the following tentative designations using the nomenclature for flavivirus proteins: gp52 and gp47, envelope proteins; gp46, non-structural protein 1; p25, gp20(prM), precursor to membrane protein; gp less than 18K. Putative core and membrane proteins were not identified. These physical and biochemical characteristics of RB virus are remarkably similar to those of the arthropod-borne members of the Flaviviridae and they confirm the classification of RB virus in this family. This is the first report of biochemical and physical properties of a non-arthropod-borne member of the Flaviviridae. ";polyalanine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

5346;30726218;Prevalence of malaria and hepatitis B among pregnant women in Northern Ghana: Comparing RDTs with PCR.;"High prevalence of malaria and hepatitis B has been reported among pregnant women in Ghana. In endemic areas, the diagnoses of malaria and hepatitis B among pregnant women on antenatal visits are done using histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), respectively, which are, however, reported to give some false positive results. Also, socio-economic determinants have been drawn from these RDTs results which may have questionable implications. Thus, this study was aimed at evaluating the prevalence of malaria and hepatitis B by comparing RDTs with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) outcomes, and relating the PCR prevalence with socio-economic status among pregnant women in Northern Ghana. We screened 2071 pregnant women on their first antenatal visit for Plasmodium falciparum and hepatitis B virus (HBV) using HRP2 and HBsAg RDTs, and confirming the infections with PCR. Socio-economic and obstetric information were collected using a pre-tested questionnaire, and associations with the infections were determined using Pearson's chi-square and multinomial logistic regression analyses at a significance level of p<0.05. The prevalence of the infections by RDTs/PCR was: 14.1%/13.4% for P. falciparum mono-infection, 7.9%/7.5% for HBV mono-infection, and 1.9%/1.7% for P. falciparum/HBV co-infection. No statistical difference in prevalence rates were observed between the RDTs and PCRs (χ2  =  0.119, p = 0.73 for malaria and χ2  =  0.139, p = 0.709 for hepatitis B). Compared with PCRs, the sensitivity/specificity of the RDTs was 97.5%/99.1% and 97.9%/99.4% for HRP2 and HBsAg respectively. Socio-economic status was observed not to influence HBV mono-infection among the pregnant women (educational status: AOR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.52-1.16, p = 0.222; economic status: AOR = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.72-1.56, p = 0.739; financial status: AOR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.44-1.00, p = 0.052). However, pregnant women with formal education were at a lower risk for P. falciparum mono-infection (AOR = 0.48, 95% CI  =  0.32-0.71, p<0.001) and P. falciparum/HBV co-infection (AOR = 0.27, 95% CI  =  0.11-0.67, p = 0.005). Also those with good financial status were also at a lower risk for P. falciparum mono-infection (AOR = 0.52, 95% CI  =  0.36-0.74, p<0.001). Our data has shown that, the RDTs are comparable to PCR and can give a representative picture of the prevalence of malaria and hepatitis B in endemic countries. Also, our results support the facts that improving socio-economic status is paramount in eliminating malaria in endemic settings. However, socio-economic status did not influence the prevalence of HBV mono-infection among pregnant women in Northern Ghana. ";polyhistidine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
5349;17084529;Early dysregulation of cripto-1 and immunomodulatory genes in the cerebral cortex in a macaque model of neuroAIDS.;Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and related primate lentiviruses are known to enter the central nervous system (CNS) during the primary phase of infection. Neuroinvasion by simian immunodeficiency virus and simian human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) is characterized by transient meningitis and astrocytosis. In this report, we used targeted cytokine cDNA arrays to analyze cortical brain tissue from four pig-tailed macaques inoculated for 2 weeks with pathogenic SHIV(50OLNV) and a normal age-matched pig-tailed macaque. Our results revealed that eight genes were significantly upregulated in all four macaques. These included: leukocyte interferon inducible peptide, corticotrophin releasing factor receptor 1, interleukin 6, CDW40 antigen, cysteine-rich fibroblast growth factor, neurotrophin 3, ciliary neurotrophin factor receptor and cripto-1. The upregulation of three of these genes was confirmed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Since cripto-1 had not been previously identified within specific cell types within the primate central nervous system, we performed immunohistochemical studies, which revealed the presence of cripto-1 in neurons. RT-PCR studies demonstrated that cripto-1 mRNA was widely expressed in the CNS. These results indicate that immunomodulatory genes are upregulated during the primary phase of infection of the central nervous system. Cripto-1, which acts as a survival factor in tumor cells and may be neuroprotective, is expressed in neurons within the CNS and is upregulated during viral invasion. ;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

In this study, the special structure of THMS was used to realize efficient fluorescence quenching and excellent signal unit transformation to complete the output of signal FAM. In the absence of Hg2+, hairpin probe (HP) containing thymine-rich (T-rich) ssDNA strand can induce the dissociation of the THMS, causing FAM far away from BHQ1 and increasing fluorescence intensity. Nevertheless, Hg2+ could bind to the thymine (T) base to form the dsDNA with T-Hg2+-T structure that stimulates Exo III to digest it from the blunt 3'-terminus to 5'-terminus, causing Hg2+ to be released from the dsDNA. The released Hg2+ could initiate the next cycling, allowing a large number of hairpin probes to be cleaved by Exo III to form ssDNA. These ssDNA could inhibit the switch dissociation of THMS, causing a dramatic decrease in the fluorescence signal. This allowed for the highly sensitive detection of Hg2+ at concentrations as low as 1.04 pM. In addition, the sensing showed a linear detection range of 0.01-50 nM and was used for the assay of Hg2+ in real samples of Xiangjiang river water and tap water.

Currently, there are no effective, globally applicable vaccines against PEDV. Here, we tested a recombinant PEDV vaccine candidate based on the expression of the core neutralising epitope (COE) of PEDV conjugated to polymeric immunoglobulin G scaffold (PIGS) in glycoengineered Nicotiana be nthamiana plants. The biological activity of COE-PIGS was demonstrated by binding to C1q component of the complement system, as well as the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in vitro. The recombinant COE-PIGS induced humoral and cellular immune responses specific for PEDV after both systemic and mucosal vaccination.

5363;10358169;Fyn membrane localization is necessary to induce the constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of Sam68 in the nucleus of T lymphocytes.;A close relationship between Sam68, a tyrosine and proline-rich RNA-binding protein, and Src protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) has already been established, also in T lymphocytes. A constitutive phosphorylation of the molecule has also been documented in various transformed T cells, which probably reflects an increased expression of PTK of the Src family. Using the hybridoma T cell line, T8.1, or Jurkat T cells, we investigated the respective contribution of the two Src kinases Fyn and Lck, expressed in T cells, in this phenomenon. By overexpressing the two proteins, we show that the constitutive phosphorylation of Sam68 in vivo directly correlates with cellular Fyn levels, but not with Lck expression, despite the capacity of the PTK to strongly phosphorylate the molecule in vitro. Overexpressed Fyn is mainly localized at the cell membrane. We find that Sam68 phosphorylation, including in the nuclear fraction in which the molecule is predominantly expressed, is lost with a delocalized Fyn mutant deleted of its N-terminal membrane-anchoring domain. Finally, we demonstrate, using a construct encoding a Sam68 molecule without its nuclear localization signal, that nuclear expression of Sam68 is not required for phosphorylation. We conclude that the constitutive phosphorylation of Sam68 in T cells is a Fyn-dependent process occurring in a cell-membrane compartment from which phospho-Sam68 molecules can thereafter accumulate into the nucleus. ;polyproline;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
5367;23679108;Small, highly active DNAs that hydrolyze DNA.;DNA phosphoester bonds are exceedingly resistant to hydrolysis in the absence of chemical or enzymatic catalysts. This property is particularly important for organisms with large genomes, as resistance to hydrolytic degradation permits the long-term storage of genetic information. Here we report the creation and analysis of two classes of engineered deoxyribozymes that selectively and rapidly hydrolyze DNA. Members of class I deoxyribozymes carry a catalytic core composed of only 15 conserved nucleotides and attain an observed rate constant (k(obs)) of ~1 min(-1) when incubated near neutral pH in the presence of Zn(2+). Natural DNA sequences conforming to the class I consensus sequence and structure were found that undergo hydrolysis under selection conditions (2 mM Zn(2+), pH 7), which demonstrates that the inherent structure of certain DNA regions might promote catalytic reactions, leading to genomic instability.;-;-;-;hard_0
5368;1846101;Diabetes-associated impairment of hepatic insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity: a study of mechanisms.;Insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity solubilized from liver of control and streptozotocin diabetic rats was studied using histone H2b and poly-Glu-Tyr (4:1) as phosphoacceptors. Both substrates inhibited autophosphorylation and exogenous kinase activity when added before, but not after, receptor activation with ATP. When H2b was added before ATP, insulin stimulated exogenous kinase activity of diabetic-derived receptors was significantly higher (approximately 50%) than control values at low H2b concentrations, but significantly lower (approximately 50%) than control values at high H2b concentrations, suggesting a decrease in the apparent Km and maximal velocity of the diabetic receptor tyrosine kinase toward H2b. When receptors were allowed to maximally autophosphorylate before the addition of H2b, the maximal H2b kinase activity of diabetic-derived receptors was only approximately 25% lower than that of controls. These effects were not attributable to altered ATP kinetics. Insulin receptor kinase activity toward the substrate poly-Glu-Tyr (4:1) was unaltered by insulinopenic diabetes. Insulin receptor alpha-beta dimers were not detectable in either control or diabetic-derived preparations. We conclude that the impairment of hepatic insulin receptor kinase activity associated with insulinopenic diabetes reflects a decreased ability to maximally activate, which is enhanced when the receptor is activated in the presence of some substrates, e.g. H2b. Impaired signalling by the diabetic-derived receptor appears to be dependent on the type of substrate and its concentration.;polyglutamine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
5369;9178768;The genetic penetrance of the activated neu oncogene for the induction of mammary cancer in vivo.;"Carcinogenesis is most often viewed as a multistage disease process. An exception to this was suggested for neu transformation of mammary cells in a transgenic model (Muller et al., 1988); however, this interpretation is controversial (Bouchard et al., 1989). In order to better define neu mammary transformation in vivo, we directly measured the genetic penetrance of the neu oncogene. Mammary cells in situ were infected with replication-defective retroviral vectors carrying the activated neu oncogene (pJRneu). A limiting dilution in vivo transplantation assay was used to measure the percentage of mammary clonogenic (stem-like) cells that stably and functionally integrated this vector. Based on this, the percentage of clonogens integrating and expressing neu that could progress to mammary carcinomas was quantified to estimate the penetrance of this gene in mammary carcinogenesis. The genetic penetrance of neu was 3.6% (95% confidence interval 2.2%-5.8%). This high degree of genetic penetrance is compatible with the observations that certain neu-transgenic mice develop a very great number of mammary carcinomas (Muller et al., 1988). However, whether these data are compatible with a single-step transformation model (100% penetrance) is uncertain and is discussed.";-;-;-;hard_0
5372;5964972;Transport and metabolism of thiamine in Ehrlich ascites-carcinoma cells.;1. Aerobic or anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees of Ehrlich ascites-carcinoma cells in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate medium containing glucose and labelled thiamine results in accumulation in the cell of labelled thiamine, so that the concentration of total labelled thiamine in the cells greatly exceeds (by a factor 7) that in the medium. This concentration ratio is approximately constant for small initial external concentrations of labelled thiamine but diminishes when the latter exceed 0.4mum. 2. All the labelled thiamine in the tumour cells is present as thiamine phosphates. 3. The uptake of labelled thiamine is markedly diminished by decrease of temperature. At 9 degrees concentration ratio (cells/medium) 0.5 is observed whereas at 37 degrees the concentration ratio is 8.6. 4. The extent of phosphorylation of labelled thiamine depends on the period of incubation. 5. The influx of labelled thiamine is diminished by the presence of its analogues, pyrithiamine and Amprol, and also by the presence of thiamine monophosphate and thiamine diphosphate, which are potent inhibitors of thiamine phosphorylation in Ehrlich ascites cells. 6. Labelled thiamine phosphates leak from the cell into the medium, so that eventually all the labelled thiamine, both in the cell and medium, is converted into thiamine phosphates. However, in the presence of 2,4-dinitrophenol (0.1mm) and iodoacetate (1mm) thiamine phosphorylation is diminished, the concentration ratio for labelled thiamine (cells/medium) falls to half its normal value and little or no labelled thiamine phosphates leaks into the medium. 7. In the presence of thiamine phosphates, free labelled thiamine accumulates in Ehrlich ascites cells against a concentration gradient, concentration ratios (cells/medium) greater than unity being evident. 8. The evidence supports the conclusion that thiamine is transferred into the Ehrlich ascites cell by a carrier-mediated energy-assisted process.;-;-;-;hard_0
5373;10596854;Interaction of factor XII and high molecular weight kininogen with cytokeratin 1 and gC1qR of vascular endothelial cells and with aggregated Abeta protein of Alzheimer's disease.;High molecular weight kininogen (HK) attaches to endothelial cells at separate sites on the heavy and light chains by a process which requires 15-50 microM zinc. Previously identified binding proteins include gClqR, cytokeratin 1, and the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (U-par), however, their relative contribution to binding are not yet clarified. We have purified the binding proteins by affinity chromatography, in the presence of zinc ion, and identified cytokeratin 1 and gC1qR by amino acid sequencing of an internal peptide and by immunoblot as heavy chain and light chain binding proteins, respectively. Antibody to cytokeratin 1 inhibited HK binding to endothelial cells by 30%, antibody to gClqR inhibited HK binding to endothelial cells by 72%, and a mixture of both inhibited binding by 86%. The binding and activation of the proteins of the kinin-forming cascade along the cell surface is zinc-dependent. Similarly, proteins of the plasma kinin-forming cascade can be activated by binding to aggregated A(beta) protein of Alzheimer's disease. Activation of the cascade using purified proteins or upon addition of Abeta to plasma requires aggregation of A(beta) and the reactions are zinc-dependent. In plasma, HK is cleaved and bradykinin is liberated. The data demonstrate that aggregated A(beta) can bind and activate proenzymes of the plasma kinin-forming cascade to release bradykinin and these reactions are dependent on zinc ion.;-;-;-;hard_0
5374;29150637;Ml proteins from Mesorhizobium loti and MucR from Brucella abortus: an AT-rich core DNA-target site and oligomerization ability.;Mesorhizobium loti contains ten genes coding for proteins sharing high amino acid sequence identity with members of the Ros/MucR transcription factor family. Five of these Ros/MucR family members from Mesorhizobium loti (Ml proteins) have been recently structurally and functionally characterized demonstrating that Ml proteins are DNA-binding proteins. However, the DNA-binding studies were performed using the Ros DNA-binding site with the Ml proteins. Currently, there is no evidence as to when the Ml proteins are expressed during the Mesorhizobium lo ti life cycle as well as no information concerning their natural DNA-binding site. In this study, we examine the ml genes expression profile in Mesorhizobium loti and show that ml1, ml2, ml3 and ml5 are expressed during planktonic growth and in biofilms. DNA-binding experiments show that the Ml proteins studied bind a conserved AT-rich site in the promoter region of the exoY gene from Mesorhizobium loti and that the proteins make important contacts with the minor groove of DNA. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Ml proteins studied form higher-order oligomers through their N-terminal region and that the same AT-rich site is recognized by MucR from Brucella abortus using a similar mechanism involving contacts with the minor groove of DNA and oligomerization. ;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

One of these orphan receptors, steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1), has recently been shown to play key roles in steroidogenic cell function within the adrenal cortex and gonads. SF-1 also contributes to reproductive function at all three levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Key insights into these roles came from analyses of SF-1 knockout mice, which revealed adrenal and gonadal agenesis with consequent male-to-female sex reversal of their internal and external genitalia, impaired gonadotrope function, and agenesis of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus.

5384;9917388;NF-Y binding to twin CCAAT boxes: role of Q-rich domains and histone fold helices.;NF-Y (CBF) is a CCAAT-binding trimer that activates 25 % of eukaryotic promoters. It contains putative histone fold motifs (HFMs) and distorts DNA. By using electrophoretic mobility shift assays with the twin CCAAT boxes of the human gamma-globin promoter and several combinations of subunit mutants, we dissected some of the structural features of CCAAT-box binding. NF-YA and NF-YC Q-rich domains significantly influence bending angles quantitatively, but not qualitatively, since they do not modify DNA orientation. They are both required for co-operative interactions among NF-Y molecules: for this, a precise alignement of two CCAAT boxes, 32 bp, three turns of the helix, is essential. Unlike the wild-type (wt) protein, steric hindrance does not impede simultaneous binding of the mutant composed of the short homology domains to CCAAT boxes closer than 22 bp: the addition of 11 amino acid residues to NF-YB and 13 to NF-YC flanking the HFM, restores wt behaviour. These stretches are predicted to form H2B-like alphaC and H2A-like alphaN fourth helices. A further support to this hypothesis comes from off-rates analysis of mutant combinations: the half-life of NF-Y, which is dependent on the type of NF-YB used, is extremely shortened, when the putative alphaC is present, nearly as much as in the wt NF-YB. These data (i) provide further evidence that NF-YB-NF-YC belong to the H2B-H2A subclasses, (ii) uncover new features of Q-rich domains, and (iii) define rules for NF-Y synergy that are potentially important for the regulation of many eukaryotic promoters. ;polyglutamine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
5389;9914158;The nucleolar phosphoprotein B23 redistributes in part to the spindle poles during mitosis.;B23 is a major phosphoprotein in the interphasic nucleolus where it is involved in the assembly of pre-ribosomes. Using several cultured animal cells, we report that, in addition to the known redistribution of the protein during mitosis, B23 also becomes associated with mitotic spindle poles starting from early prometaphase onwards. Colocalization of B23 with the protein NuMA (Nuclear Mitotic Apparatus protein) was studied in mitotic cells and taxol-arrested cells. During the onset of mitosis, we observed that a fraction of B23 associates with, and dissociates from, the poles later than NuMA. At metaphase, both proteins are colocalized at the poles. The polar redistribution of both B23 and NuMA is mediated by microtubules. In taxol-treated cells, B23 is associated with the microtubule minus ends in the center of mitotic asters together with NuMA. Association of B23 with microtubule minus ends of mitotic asters was further confirmed with an in vitro assay, where B23 was found by western blotting to co-sediment with taxol-induced microtubule asters formed in a mitotic cell extract. Immunolabeling demonstrated that B23 and NuMA were both present at the center of the asters. Furthermore, an additional hyperphosphorylated form of B23 appeared when microtubule asters formed and associated with the asters. Immunodepletion of B23 from the mitotic extract revealed that taxol-induced microtubule asters were still observed in B23-immunodepleted mitotic extract, indicating that the presence of B23 at the poles is unlikely to be essential for spindle formation or stabilisation.;-;-;-;hard_0
5392;18764931;C-reactive protein exerts angiogenic effects on vascular endothelial cells and modulates associated signalling pathways and gene expression.;Formation of haemorrhagic neovessels in the intima of developing atherosclerotic plaques is thought to significantly contribute to plaque instability resulting in thrombosis. C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute phase reactant whose expression in the vascular wall, in particular, in reactive plaque regions, and circulating levels increase in patients at high risk of cardiovascular events. Although CRP is known to induce a pro-inflammatory phenotype in endothelial cells (EC) a direct role on modulation of angiogenesis has not been established. Here, we show that CRP is a powerful inducer of angiogenesis in bovine aortic EC (BAEC) and human coronary artery EC (HCAEC). CRP, at concentrations corresponding to moderate/high risk (1-5 microg/ml), induced a significant increase in proliferation, migration and tube-like structure formation in vitro and stimulated blood vessel formation in the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay (CAM). CRP treated with detoxi-gel columns retained such effects. Western blotting showed that CRP increased activation of early response kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2), a key protein involved in EC mitogenesis. Furthermore, using TaqMan Low-density Arrays we identified key pro-angiogenic genes induced by CRP among them were vascular endothelial cell growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2/KDR), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB), notch family transcription factors (Notch1 and Notch3), cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (CYR61/CCN1) and inhibitor of DNA binding/differentiation-1 (ID1). This data suggests a role for CRP in direct stimulation of angiogenesis and therefore may be a mediator of neovessel formation in the intima of vulnerable plaques. ;polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

To understand the clinical significance of E. faecium bacteremia, we compared 16 patients who were bacteremic due to E. faecium to 56 patients who were bacteremic due to Enterococcus faecalis. E. faecium bacteremia developed most frequently in severely ill patients with fever or hypothermia accompanied by CNS, cardiovascular, and/or pulmonary dysfunction, while E. faecalis bacteremia occurred most often in less seriously ill patients. Nosocomial acquisition, cancer, neutropenia, renal insufficiency, current corticosteroid therapy, and previous treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics were significantly more frequently associated with E. faecium bacteremia. Mortality was significantly higher among patients infected with E. faecium than among those infected with E. faecalis (50% vs. 11%; P = .001); this was true particularly among patients with monomicrobial or nosocomial bacteremia, those who had previously received antibiotic treatment, and those with cancer. Death due to enterococcal bacteremia was observed only among severely ill patients. These findings suggest that E. faecium often infects debilitated patients and that such infection appears to be a significant factor contributing to mortality.";-;-;-;hard_0
5395;3924863;The involvement of nucleosomes in Giemsa staining of chromosomes. A new hypothesis on the banding mechanism.;A new hypothesis is proposed on the involvement of nucleosomes in Giemsa banding of chromosomes. Giemsa staining as well as the concomitant swelling can be explained as an insertion of the triple charged hydrophobic dye complex between the negatively-charged super-coiled helical DNA and the denatured histone cores of the nucleosomes still present in the fixed chromosomes. New cytochemical data and recent results from biochemical literature on nucleosomes are presented in support of this hypothesis. Chromosomes are stained by the Giemsa procedure in a purple (magenta) colour. Giemsa staining of DNA and histone (isolated or in a simple mixture) in model experiments results in different colours, indicating that a higher order configuration of these chromosomal components lies at the basis of the Giemsa method. Cytophotometry of Giemsa dye absorbance of chromosomes shows that the banding in the case of saline pretreatment is due to a relative absence of the complex in the faintly coloured bands (interbands). Pretreatment with trypsin results in an increase in Giemsa dye uptake in the stained bands. Cytophotometric measurements of free phosphate groups before and after pretreatment with saline, reveal a blocking of about half of the free phosphate groups indicating that a substantial number of free amino groups is still present in the fixed chromosomes. Glutaraldehyde treatment inhibited Giemsa-banding irreversibly while the formaldehyde-induced disappearance of the bands could be restored by a washing procedure. These results correlate with those of biochemical nucleosome studies using the same aldehydes. Based on these findings and on the known properties of nucleosomes, a mechanism is proposed that explains the collapse of the chromosome structure when fixed chromosomes are transferred to aqueous buffer solutions. During homogeneous Giemsa staining reswelling of the unpretreated chromosome is explained by insertion of the hydrophobic Giemsa complex between the hydrophobic nucleosome cores and the superhelix DNA. Selective Giemsa staining of the AT-enriched bands after saline pretreatment is thought to be due to the, biochemically well-documented, higher affinity of arginine-rich proteins present in the core histones for GC-enriched DNA, which prevents the insertion of the Giemsa complex in the interbands. Production of Giemsa bands by trypsin pretreatment can be related to the action of this enzyme on the H1 histones and subsequent charge rearrangements.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) ;polyarginine;helix;-;LCR_with_function

The first is a double diffusion technique (ID-HSA) were the sera to be tested are reacted with a copolymer of glutaraldehyde  activated HSA (copoly-HSA). The reaction is estimated by the lowest copoly HSA concentration giving precipitation with the undiluted sera. The second method is based on agglutination (HA) by AAA positive sera of human red blood cells coated with glutaraldehyde-polymerized HSA (EPA). The reaction is quantified as the highest dilution of sera giving agglutination. The third method uses glutaraldehyde insolubilized HSA as an immunoadorbent able to bind AAA in positive sera.

5401;10446268;Differential expression of VegT and Antipodean protein isoforms in Xenopus.;The VegT/Antipodean (Apod) gene is important for germ layer formation in Xenopus. To investigate the role of this gene at the protein level, as opposed to the RNA level, we have generated affinity purified polyclonal antibodies to Apod, and for comparison, to the other early T-box proteins Xbrachyury and Eomesodermin. An anti-VegT/Apod antibody reveals that there are two protein isoforms in Xenopus, one that we refer to as VegT and a smaller molecular weight isoform that we refer to as Apod. These isoforms have different N-terminal domains resulting from developmentally regulated alternative splicing of a primary transcript arising from a single VegT/Apod gene. VegT is maternally expressed. Its translation is blocked during oogenesis but the protein is present from the egg until gastrulation in the presumptive endoderm. There is no evidence for zygotic expression of this isoform. Conversely, the Apod protein isoform is expressed only after the onset of zygotic transcription in the presumptive mesoderm and is inducible by activin. We conclude that the developmental role of VegT/Apod is mediated by two different proteins, with entirely different patterns of expression and response to growth factors.;-;-;-;hard_0
5405;4712565;Properties of a fructose-1,6-diphosphate-activated lactate dehydrogenase from Acholeplasma laidlawii type A.;"Acholeplasma laidlawii A possesses a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent l(+)-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) which is activated specifically by low concentrations of fructose-1, 6-diphosphate (FDP). Studies with partially purified enzyme show that the kinetic response to FDP is hyperbolic. The enzyme is inhibited by inorganic phosphate, adenosine triphosphate, and high concentrations of reduced NAD (NADH). Low activity is demonstrable in the absence of FDP at pH 6.0 to 7.2, but FDP is absolutely required in the region of pH 8. FDP causes an upward shift in the optimum pH of the enzyme, which is near 7.2 in tris (hydroxymethyl)aminomethane buffer. Activation of the enzyme by FDP is markedly affected by substrate concentration; FDP lowers the apparent K(m) for pyruvate and NADH. The affinity of the enzyme for pyruvate is also influenced by H(+) concentration. The pyruvate analogue alpha-ketobutyrate serves as an effective substrate for the enzyme; when it is utilized, the enzyme is still activated by FDP. Reversal of the pyruvate reduction reaction catalyzed by the enzyme can be demonstrated with the 3-acetylpyridine analogue of NAD.

5412;12031500;Genomic structure and promoter characterization of the gene encoding the ErbB ligand betacellulin.;"Betacellulin (BTC) belongs to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family of peptide ligands that are characterized by a six-cysteine consensus motif (EGF-motif) that forms three intra-molecular disulfide bonds, crucial for binding the ErbB receptor family. A variety of in vitro studies have identified BTC as an important factor in the growth and/or differentiation of pancreatic islet cells. The molecular mechanisms that regulate the transcription of the BTC gene however have not been delineated. As an initial step, we have characterized the genomic structure of the mouse BTC (mBTC) gene. mBTC cDNA was used as a probe to screen a mouse 129/SVJ genomic bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library. Three positive clones containing the entire gene were isolated. DNA sequence analysis identified six exons (1-6) and five introns (A-E); a structure conserved among the EGF family. PCR analysis showed that introns A-E are approximately 7.8, 8.9, 3.8, 1.4 and 1.4 kb in length, respectively. The EGF-motif is encoded by exons 3 and 4 with an intron (intron C) disrupting the coding sequence between the second and third disulfide loops. All exon-intron boundaries are consistent with the ""gt-ag"" rule. Multiple transcription start sites and one poly(A) site, located 18 bp downstream of a polyadenylation signal sequence, were identified by 5'- and 3'-RACE, respectively. Approximately 2.6 kb of 5'-flanking region was sequenced and was shown to lack consensus TATA and CCAAT boxes, but was found to contain several putative cis-acting regulatory elements. These included consensus binding sites for transcription factors HNF3 beta, USF, Nkx2-5, AP-4, and Sp1.

5413;19197908;Two variable semi-empirical and artificial neural-network-based modeling of peptide mobilities in CZE: the effect of temperature and organic modifier concentration.;This work was focused on investigating the effects of two separation influencing parameters in CZE, namely temperature and organic additive concentration upon the electrophoretic migration properties of model tripeptides. Two variable semi-empirical (TVSE) models and back-propagation artificial neural networks (ANN) were applied to predict the electrophoretic mobilities of the tripeptides with non-polar, polar, positively charged, negatively charged and aromatic R group characteristics. Previously published work on the subject did not account for the effect of temperature and buffer organic modifier concentration on peptide mobility, in spite of the fact that both were considered to be influential factors in peptide analysis. In this work, a substantial data set was generated consisting of actual electrophoretic mobilities of the model tripeptides in 30 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.5, at 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 degrees C and at four different organic additive containing running buffers (0, 5, 10 and 15% MeOH) applying two electric field strengths (12 and 16 kV) to assess our mobility predicting models. Based on the Arrhenius plots of natural logarithm of mobility versus reciprocal absolute temperature of the various experimental setups, the corresponding activation energy values were derived and evaluated. Calculated mobilities by TVSE and back-propagation ANN models were compared with each other and to the experimental data, respectively. Neural network approaches were able to model the complex impact of both temperature and organic additive concentrations and resulted in considerably higher predictive power over the TVSE models, justifying that the effect of these two factors should not be neglected.;-;-;-;hard_0
5414;22534133;Studying the dynamics of SLP-76, Nck, and Vav1 multimolecular complex formation in live human cells with triple-color FRET.;Protein-protein interactions regulate and control many cellular functions. A multimolecular complex consisting of the adaptor proteins SLP-76 (Src homology 2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kD), Nck, and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav1 is recruited to the T cell side of the interface with an antigen-presenting cell during initial T cell activation. This complex is crucial for regulation of the actin machinery, antigen recognition, and signaling in T cells. We studied the interactions between these proteins as well as the dynamics of their recruitment into a complex that governs cytoskeletal reorganization. We developed a triple-color Förster resonance energy transfer (3FRET) system to observe the dynamics of the formation of this trimolecular signaling complex in live human T cells and to follow the three molecular interactions in parallel. Using the 3FRET system, we demonstrated that dimers of Nck and Vav1 were constitutively formed independently of both T cell activation and the association between SLP-76 and Nck. After T cell receptor stimulation, SLP-76 was phosphorylated, which enabled the binding of Nck. A point mutation in the proline-rich site of Vav1, which abolishes its binding to Nck, impaired actin rearrangement, suggesting that Nck-Vav1 dimers play a critical role in regulation of the actin machinery. We suggest that these findings revise the accepted model of the formation of a complex of SLP-76, Nck, and Vav1 and demonstrate the use of 3FRET as a tool to study signal transduction in live cells. ;polyproline;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

Other findings when the suture lines were examined included residual native valve remnants, protruding tissue tags or other tissue remnants, mural thrombi, and protruding free suture ends. These findings are described, illustrated, and discussed in the context of the published literature on the subject.;-;-;-;hard_0
5417;26563449;Inhibition of the Androgen Receptor by Antiandrogens in Spinobulbar Muscle Atrophy.;Spinal-bulbar muscle atrophy (SBMA) or also named Kennedy's Disease is caused by a polyglutamine expansion (PolyQ) of the coding region of the androgen receptor (AR). The AR is a ligand-controlled transcription factor and member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. The central characteristics of the SBMA pathogenicity are muscle weakness, the loss of motoneurons and the occurrence of AR-containing protein aggregates that are observed in spinal cord motoneurons and skeletal muscles induced by the AR-PolyQ expansion in the presence of androgens. The PolyQ triggers a misfolding in the AR-PolyQ and leads to protein aggregation in spinal cord motoneurons and muscle cells. The AR-PolyQ toxicity is activated by the AR ligand testosterone and dihydrotestosterone that activate the receptor and triggers nuclear toxicity by inducing AR nuclear translocation. In line with this, androgen treatment of SBMA patients worsened the SBMA symptoms. SBMA has been modeled in AR-overexpressing and AR-PolyQ-knock-in animals, but precisely how the PolyQ expansion leads to neurodegeneration is unclear. The androgen-induced toxicity and androgen-dependent nuclear accumulation of AR-PolyQ protein seems to be central to the pathogenesis. Therefore, the inhibition of the androgen-activated AR-PolyQ might be a therapeutic option. Here the use of AR antagonists for treatment option of SBMA will be reviewed and discussed.  ;polyglutamine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

5429;9405234;A bidirectional promoter connects the p14.5 gene to the gene for RNase P and RNase MRP protein subunit hPOP1.;We have identified the functional promoter of the translational inhibitor p14.5, the human homologue to a rat perchloric acid-soluble protein (PSP), a mouse heat-responsive protein (Hrp12) and a goat tumor antigen (UK114). Sequence analysis revealed a GC-rich promoter with several consensus sequences for transcription factors, but no TATA- and CAAT-box. To confirm promoter activity, DNA fragments of the p14.5 5'-flanking region were ligated in front of the luciferase gene and were transfected into HeLa and HepG2 cells. A minimal promoter between nt -104 and nt +88 relative to the transcription start site was responsible for basal activity. Furthermore, we observed a head-to-head orientation of p14.5 to the gene for the protein subunit of RNase P and MRP ribonucleoproteins (hPOP1). Luciferase assays with fragments of the hPOP1 5'-flanking region revealed a minimal promoter between nt -20 and nt +98 relative to the start of transcription. These data indicate that the 102 bp region between p14.5 and hPOP1 can act as a bidirectional promoter. The p14.5-hPOP1-cluster was mapped to chromosome 8q22 using in situ hybridization technique. ;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
5430;23783411;Deep RNA-Seq uncovers the peach transcriptome landscape.;Peach (Prunus persica) is one of the most important of deciduous fruit trees worldwide. To facilitate isolation of genes controlling important horticultural traits of peach, transcriptome sequencing was conducted in this study. A total of 133 million pair-end RNA-Seq reads were generated from leaf, flower, and fruit, and 90 % of reads were mapped to the peach draft genome. Sequence assembly revealed 1,162 transcription factors and 2,140 novel transcribed regions (NTRs). Of these 2,140 NTRs, 723 contain an open reading frame, while the rest 1,417 are non-coding RNAs. A total of 9,587 SNPs were identified across six peach genotypes, with an average density of one SNP per ~5.7 kb. The top of chromosome 2 has higher density of expressed SNPs than the rest of the peach genome. The average density of SSR is 312.5/Mb, with tri-nucleotide repeats being the most abundant. Most of the detected SSRs are AT-rich repeats and the most common di-nucleotide repeat is CT/TC. The predominant type of alternative splicing (AS) events in peach is exon-skipping isoforms, which account for 43 % of all the observed AS events. In addition, the most active transcribed regions in peach genome were also analyzed. Our study reveals for the first time the complexity of the peach transcriptome, and our results will be helpful for functional genomics research in peach.  ;polythreonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

Insights into the mechanism of Hfq action have come from a variety of approaches. A key finding was the characterization of two RNA binding sites: the Proximal Site, which binds sRNA and mRNA; and the Distal Site, which binds poly(A) tails. Hfq was shown to interact with PAP I, PNP and RNase E, proteins that are involved in mRNA decay and in vitro, was shown to form fibres, the physiological significance of which is unknown.

5443;8626538;Molecular cloning of a novel diacylglycerol kinase isozyme with a pleckstrin homology domain and a C-terminal tail similar to those of the EPH family of protein-tyrosine kinases.;A fourth member of the diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) gene family termed DGK delta was cloned from the human testis cDNA library. The cDNA sequence contains an open reading frame of 3,507 nucleotides encoding a putative DGK protein of 130,006 Da. Interestingly, the new DGK isozyme contains a pleckstrin homology domain found in a number of proteins involved in signal transduction. Furthermore, the C-terminal tail of this isozyme is very similar to those of the EPH family of receptor tyrosine kinases. The primary structure of the delta-isozyme also has two cysteine-rich zinc finger-like structures (C3 region) and the C-terminal C4 region, both of which have been commonly found in the three isozymes previously cloned (DGKs alpha, beta and gamma). However, DGK delta lacks the EF-hand motifs (C2) and contains a long Glu- and Ser-rich insertion (317 residues), which divides the C4 region into two portions. Taken together, these structural features of DGK delta indicate that this isozyme belongs to a DGK subfamily distinct from that consisting of DGKs alpha, beta, and gamma. Increased DGK activity without marked preference to arachidonoyl type of diacylglycerol was detected in the particulate fraction of COS-7 cells expressing the transfected DGKdelta cDNA. The enzyme activity was independent of phosphatidylserine, which is a common activator for the previously sequenced DGKs. Northern blot analysis showed that the DGK delta mRNA (approximately 6.3 kilobases) is most abundant in human skeletal muscle but undetectable in the brain, thymus, and retina. This expression pattern is different from those of the previously cloned DGKs. Our results show that the DGK gene family consists of at least two subfamilies consisting of enzymes with distinct structural characteristics and that each cell type probably expresses its own characteristic repertoire of DGKs whose functions may be regulated through different signal transduction pathways. ;polycysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
5447;9106374;Anxious depression in elderly patients. Response to antidepressant treatment.;The authors asked whether elderly patients with anxious depression were less responsive to antidepressant treatment than nonanxious depressed patients. A group of 101 depressed patients were treated with 6 weeks of nortriptyline and then, if necessary, 2 weeks of adjunctive lithium. Patients who did not respond to or were intolerant of this first line of treatment were then given 6 weeks of phenelzine (+/- lithium augmentation). Finally, patients failing this second line of treatment were given either a course of electroconvulsive therapy or 6 weeks of fluoxetine (+/- lithium augmentation). Based on their score on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at index assessment, subjects were divided into anxious and nonanxious groups. Anxious depressed patients were significantly less responsive to nortriptyline on both intent-to-treat and efficacy analyses. They were also more likely to discontinue treatment and, as a result, were significantly less responsive on the intent-to-treat analysis for overall treatment.

5450;15489295;The geminivirus nuclear shuttle protein is a virulence factor that suppresses transmembrane receptor kinase activity.;Despite the large number of leucine-rich-repeat (LRR) receptor-like-kinases (RLKs) in plants and their conceptual relevance in signaling events, functional information is restricted to a few family members. Here we describe the characterization of new LRR-RLK family members as virulence targets of the geminivirus nuclear shuttle protein (NSP). NSP interacts specifically with three LRR-RLKs, NIK1, NIK2, and NIK3, through an 80-amino acid region that encompasses the kinase active site and A-loop. We demonstrate that these NSP-interacting kinases (NIKs) are membrane-localized proteins with biochemical properties of signaling receptors. They behave as authentic kinase proteins that undergo autophosphorylation and can also phosphorylate exogenous substrates. Autophosphorylation occurs via an intermolecular event and oligomerization precedes the activation of the kinase. Binding of NSP to NIK inhibits its kinase activity in vitro, suggesting that NIK is involved in antiviral defense response. In support of this, infectivity assays showed a positive correlation between infection rate and loss of NIK1 and NIK3 function. Our data are consistent with a model in which NSP acts as a virulence factor to suppress NIK-mediated antiviral responses. ;polyleucine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function

CIC were detected by the PEG-C4 assay, using a laser nephelometry determination of polyethylene glycol (PEG, 3.5%) precipitated endogenous C4. T cells were evaluated by E rosettes, active E rosettes, anti-HTLA serum and ox EA gamma-rosettes. This latter method investigated mainly T cells bearing Fc receptors for IgG (Tgamma-cells). After 1 month of PUVA-therapy: (a) the cutaneous lesions markedly improved; (b) the mean percentages of E rosettes, active E rosettes, and HTLA bearing cells, depressed before treatment, returned to normal; (c) CIC were found in higher amounts; (d) T gamma-cell numbers decreased simultaneously. The improvement of T-cell levels assessed by E rosettes, active E rosettes and HTLA values was correlated with clearing of skin lesions, as previously reported by others. However, the increase of CIC during PUVA therapy, their correlation with T gamma-cell decrease, and their possible role in the pathogenic chain of psoriasis remains uncertain.";-;-;-;hard_0
5455;9736631;Nicotinic stimulation produces multiple forms of increased glutamatergic synaptic transmission.;"Synaptic modulation and long-term synaptic changes are thought to be the cellular correlates for learning and memory (Madison et al., 1991; Aiba et al., 1994, Goda and Stevens, 1996). The hippocampus is a center for learning and memory that receives abundant cholinergic innervation and has a high density of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) (Wada et al., 1989; Woolf, 1991). We report that stro ng, brief stimulation of nAChRs enhanced hippocampal glutamatergic synaptic transmission on two independent time scales and altered the relationship between consecutively evoked synaptic currents. The nicotinic synaptic enhancement required extracellular calcium and was produced by the activation of presynaptic alpha7-containing nAChRs. Although one form of glutamatergic enhancement lasted only for seconds, another form lasted for minutes after the nicotinic stimulation had ceased and the nicotinic agonist had been washed away. The synaptic enhancement lasting minutes suggests that nAChR activity can initiate calcium-dependent mechanisms that are known to induce glutamatergic synaptic plasticity. The results with evoked synaptic currents showed that nAChR activity can alter the relationship between the incoming presynaptic activity and outgoing postsynaptic signaling along glutamatergic fibers. Thus, the same information arriving along the same glutamatergic afferents will be processed differently when properly timed nicotinic activity converges onto the glutamatergic presynaptic terminals. Influencing information processing at glutamatergic synapses may be one way in which nicotinic cholinergic activity influences cognitive processes. Disruption of these nicotinic cholinergic mechanisms may contribute to the deficits associated with the degeneration of cholinergic functions during Alzheimer's disease.";-;-;-;hard_0
5456;9918933;Detection of occult low-grade b-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection and mixed cryoglobulinemia.;Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is both hepatotropic and lymphotropic and has been shown to be associated with the benign lymphoproliferative disorder, mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC). Preliminary studies suggest that there may be an association between chronic hepatitis C, MC, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The aim of this study was to determine whether patients with chronic HCV and MC have occult bone marrow NHL. Sixteen patients with chronic HCV and clinically active MC underwent bone marrow biopsy and aspiration. Flow cytometry was performed looking for abnormal B-cell lineage. Molecular genetic studies were performed to identify B-cell monoclonality. Nine of 16 patients (56%) had abnormal marrow morphology, 7 (44%) were interpreted as suspicious for lymphoma, and 2 (13%) as consistent with lymphoma. Flow cytometry on 13 patients identified 5 (39%) with increased B-cell populations. Molecular analysis on 13 patients identified 3 (23%) with monoclonal proliferation of the B-cell lineage. All 13 patients tested for Epstein-Barr virus were negative by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Four of 16 patients (25%) had marrow morphology and evidence of a monoclonal B-cell population by flow cytometry and/or molecular studies, consistent with B-cell NHL. These findings confirm the presence of lymphoproliferative disorders in patients with chronic HCV and MC.

The cell population proliferating in response to Fc fragments belongs to the B cell lineage. Expression of polyclonal antibody formation requires the presence of both adherent monocytes and T cells. The role of the monocyte is to enzymatically cleave the Fc fragment into 19,000 mol wt Fc subfragments that are then able to induce polyclonal antibody secretion. Stimulation of polyclonal antibody production by Fc subfragments occurs in the absence of adherent monocytes but still requires the presence of T cells.;-;-;-;hard_0

The FBPs each bind sequence specifically to only one strand of the far upstream element (FUSE; originally identified upstream of c-myc), and each possesses potent activation domains when fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and assayed by transient transfection. Typical of transcription factors, the proteins are most highly related in their central, DNA-binding domains, but extensive homology is also shared within the tyrosine-rich, carboxyl-terminal activation domains.

5465;8595958;Systemic hypoxia dehydrates the space surrounding photoreceptors in the cat retina.;"PURPOSE
To assess the effects of systemic hypoxia and hyperoxia on the volume of the subretinal space (SRS).


METHODS
The authors measured the concentration of the extracellular space marker tetramethylammonium (TMA+) in the intact cat eye using double-barreled ion-selective microelectrodes. The retina was loaded with TMA+ by a single intravitreal injection. Systemic hypoxia was induced by adding nitrogen to the breathing mixture, and hyperoxia was induced by adding oxygen.


RESULTS
Hypoxia produced a slow increase in dark- adapted [TMA+]0, which was prominent in amplitude in the distal portion of the retina, suggesting a shrinkage of the SRS. This effect was essentially proportional to the decrease in arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) below the normoxic level. Dark-adapted (TMA+)0 began to increase at a PaO2 of 60 to 80 mm Hg and was enhanced by 13% to 15% at a PaO2 of 40 mm Hg. Because of its slow onset, the size of the increase also was related to the duration of hypoxia. The light-evoked decrease in (TMA+)0 in the SRS was larger in amplitude during hypoxia than in normoxia. This difference increased with severity of hypoxia, beginning at approximately the same PaO2 as the increase in dark-adapted (TMA+)0. Interestingly, the hypoxic increase in amplitude depended on light intensity, i.e., it was proportionally greater at lower intensities versus higher ones. Background illumination suppressed the hypoxia-induced increase in (TMA+)0 in SRS, inhibiting it by approximately 50% at levels of hypoxia down to a PaO2 of 40 mm Hg. Systemic hyperoxia produced the reverse effect of hypoxia. Between two extreme states, e.g., illumination during hyperoxia (PaO2 > 200 mm Hg) versus severe hypoxia in darkness (PaO2 approximately 40 mm Hg), extracellular volume may change more than 4-fold.


CONCLUSIONS
The observations of this study indicate that the space surrounding photoreceptors shrinks in response to hypoxia. This shrinkage should affect concentrations of all ions and metabolites located in the subretinal space.";-;-;-;hard_0
5468;33527361;Identification of retinal ganglion cell types expressing the transcription factor Satb2 in three primate species.;In primates, the retinal ganglion cells contributing to high acuity spatial vision (midget cells and parasol cells), and blue-yellow color vision (small bistratified cells) are well understood. Many other ganglion cell types with large dendritic fields (named wide-field ganglion cells) have been identified, but their spatial density and distribution are largely unknown. Here we took advantage of the recently established molecular diversity of ganglion cells to study wide-field ganglion cell populations in three primate species. We used antibodies against the transcription factor Special AT-rich binding protein 2 (Satb2) to explore its expression in macaque (Macaca fascicularis, M. nemestrina), human and marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) retinas. In all three species, Satb2 cells make up a low proportion (1.5-4%) of the ganglion cell population, with a slight increase from central to peripheral retina. Intracellular dye injections revealed that in macaque and human retinas, the large majority (over 80%) of Satb2 cells are inner and outer stratifying large sparse cells. By contrast, in marmoset retina the majority (over 60%) of Satb2 expressing cells were broad thorny cells, with smaller proportions of recursive bistratified (putative direction-selective), large bistratified, and outer stratifying narrow thorny cells. Our findings imply that Satb2 expression has undergone rapid species specific adaptations during primate evolution, because expression is not conserved across Old World (macaque, human) and New World (marmoset) suborders.;polythreonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
5469;9294176;Cloning and characterization of the mouse vitamin D receptor promoter.;The gene encoding the mouse vitamin D receptor has been cloned. A new exon 1 has been found that changes the numbering established for the human VDR gene. Exons 2 and 3 in the human VDR gene (coding for the zinc fingers 1 and 2, respectively) are named exons 3 and 4 in the mouse vitamin D receptor. The 1.5-kb 5'-flanking region of the new exon 1 was analyzed and revealed the presence of putative cis-acting elements. Despite the absence of a TATA box, this 5'-flanking region contains several characteristics of a GC-rich promoter including four Sp1 sites present in tandem and two CCAAT boxes. Interestingly, the Sp1 site that is the most proximal to the new exon 1 overlaps a perfect site for Krox-20/24. Krox-20 is a transcription factor involved in brain development, and also in bone remodeling. In luciferase reporter gene expression assays, we showed that sequences from this 5'-flanking region elicit high transactivation activity. Furthermore, in the NIH 3T3 cell line, a 3- to 5-fold increase in response to forskolin treatment (an activator of adenylate cyclase and in turn of protein kinase A pathway) was observed. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
5470;30135183;The Canonical but Not the Noncanonical Wnt Pathway Inhibits the Development of Allergic Airway Disease.;Asthma is a syndrome with multifactorial causes, resulting in a variety of different phenotypes. Current treatment options are not curative and are sometimes ineffective in certain disease phenotypes. Therefore, novel therapeutic approaches are required. Recent findings have shown that activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway suppresses the development of allergic airway disease. In contrast, the effect of the noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway activation on allergic airway disease is not well described. The aim of this study was to validate the therapeutic effectiveness of Wnt-1-driven canonical Wnt signaling compared with Wnt-5a-driven noncanonical signaling in murine models. In vitro, both ligands were capable of attenuating allergen-specific T cell activation in a dendritic cell-dependent manner. In addition, the therapeutic effects of Wnt ligands were assessed in two different models of allergic airway disease. Application of Wnt-1 resulted in suppression of airway inflammation as well as airway hyperresponsiveness and mucus production. In contrast, administration of Wnt-5a was less effective in reducing airway inflammation or goblet cell metaplasia. These results suggest an immune modulating function for canonical as well as noncanonical Wnt signaling, but canonical Wnt pathway activation appears to be more effective in suppressing allergic airway disease than noncanonical Wnt activation.;-;-;-;hard_0
5471;8943948;Regulation of cardiac Ca2+ release channel (ryanodine receptor) by Ca2+, H+, Mg2+, and adenine nucleotides under normal and simulated ischemic conditions.;In myocardial ischemia, pHi and [ATP] fall, whereas the free [Ca2+] and [Mg2+] rise. The effects of these changes on cardiac Ca2+ release channel (ryanodine receptor) activity were investigated in [3H]ryanodine binding and single-channel measurements, using isolated membrane and purified channel preparations. In the absence of the two channel ligands Mg2+ and ATP, cardiac Ca2+ release channels were half-maximally activated at pH 7.4 by approximately 4 mumol/L cytosolic Ca2+ and half-maximally inhibited by approximately 9 mmol/L cytosolic Ca2+. Regulation of channel activity by Ca2+ was modulated by Mg2+ and ATP. Single-channel activities were more sensitive to a change of cytosolic pH than SR lumenal pH. Reduction in lumenal and/or cytosolic pH from 7.3 to 6.5 and 6.0 resulted in decreased single-channel activities without a change in single-channel conductance. [3H]Ryanodine binding measurements also indicated that acidosis impairs cardiac Ca2+ release channel activity. Mg2+ and adenine nucleotide concentrations regulated the extent of inhibition and the Ca2+ dependence of binding. In the presence of 5 mmol/L Mg2+ and 5 mmol/L beta, gamma-methyleneadenosine 5'-triphosphate (AMPPCP, a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue), the free [Ca2+] for half-maximal [3H]ryanodine binding was increased from 1.9 mumol/L at pH 7.3 to 36 mumol/L at pH 6.5 and to 89 mumol/L at pH 6.2. These results suggest that ionic and metabolic changes that might be expected to affect sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release channel activity in ischemic myocardium include an altered Ca2+ sensitivity of the channel, a fall in pH, and a loss of the high-energy adenine nucleotide pool, leading to an increased inhibition by Mg2+.;-;-;-;hard_0

Here, we report that coffee and tobacco, but not caffeine or nicotine, are neuroprotective in fly PD models. We further report that decaffeinated coffee and nicotine-free tobacco are as neuroprotective as their caffeine and nicotine-containing counterparts and that the neuroprotective effects of decaffeinated coffee and nicotine-free tobacco are also evident in Drosophila models of Alzheimer's disease and polyglutamine disease. Finally, we report that the neuroprotective effects of decaffeinated coffee and nicotine-free tobacco require the cytoprotective transcription factor Nrf2 and that a known Nrf2 activator in coffee, cafestol, is also able to confer neuroprotection in our fly models of PD. Our findings indicate that coffee and tobacco contain Nrf2-activating compounds that may account for the reduced risk of PD among coffee and tobacco users. These compounds represent attractive candidates for therapeutic intervention in PD and perhaps other neurodegenerative diseases. ;polyglutamine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

5483;8613657;How much lactose is low lactose?;"OBJECTIVE
To test the hypothesis that complete elimination of lactose is not necessary to ensure tolerance by lactose maldigesters.


DESIGN
Double-blind, randomized protocol in which challenge doses of 0, 2, 6, 12, and 20 g lactose in water were fed to subjects after a 12-hour fast.


SUBJECTS
13 healthy, free-living adults who were lactose maldigesters.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Breath hydrogen production (a measure of maldigestion) and symptom response to each challenge dose.


STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Analysis of variance was done to determine overall differences in mean hydrogen gas production (peak and sum of hours 1 through 8). Friedman's test was used to determine overall differences in the mean ranks for each symptom. Fisher's least significant difference test was used for multiple comparisons for hydrogen and symptom and data.


RESULTS
Hydrogen production after consumption of the 0- and 2-g lactose doses was not significantly different. Hydrogen production increased with the 6-g dose. Intensity of abdominal pain increased when the dose of lactose was 12 g. Episodes of flatulence did not increase until the dose reached 20 g. No significant differences in the occurrence of diarrhea were observed after the five treatments.


CONCLUSIONS
No significant increase in breath hydrogen production or intolerance symptoms occurred after consumption of a 2-g dose of lactose. Up to 6 g was tolerated, even though maldigestion could be measured at the 6-g dose. Thus, lactose maldigesters may be able to tolerate foods containing 6 g lactose or less per serving, such as hard cheeses and small servings (120 mL or less) of milk.";-;-;-;hard_0

As a group the animals presented a statistically significant increase of convulsive withdrawal phenomena which during the 10th and 17th episode was comparable to the withdrawal reaction in abstinent 4-day alcohol-intoxicated animals. It is suggested that the present model may represent a paradigm for the study of effects of multiple ethanol withdrawal episodes.;-;-;-;hard_0
5487;9580699;Sp1, but not Sp3, functions to mediate promoter activation by TGF-beta through canonical Sp1 binding sites.;Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) causes growth arrest at the G1 phase of the cell cycle in most cell types. Both the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p15(INK4B) and p21(Cip1/WAF1) genes have been found to be induced by TGF-beta in human keratinocyte HaCaT cells. Analyses of the human p15 and p21 promoters have led to the identification of GC-rich sequences capable of binding to Sp1 transcription factors as necessary elements for the TGF-beta induction of both promoters. We report here that canonical Sp1 binding sites derived from the SV40 21 bp repeat could also support promoter induction by TGF-beta when placed upstream of a minimal luciferase reporter construct containing only the TATA and Inr elements. Gel retardation assays identified Sp1, Sp3 and DeltaSp3 as major factors binding to the canonical Sp1 sites in HaCaT cells and that TGF-beta treatment did not change their binding activities over a 24 h period. More importantly, GAL4-Sp1, but not GAL4-Sp3, chimeric protein supported TGF-beta mediated gene induction from a luciferase reporter construct driven by five GAL4 DNA binding sites. Our results suggest that Sp1 binding site can function as a distinct TGF-beta responsive element for TGF-beta mediated promoter expression and Sp1 per se can mediate this response. ;polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

5492;24704476;FbaA- and M protein-based multi-epitope vaccine elicits strong protective immune responses against group A streptococcus in mouse model.;We report the construction of a recombinant multivalent vaccine against group A streptococcus (GAS), designated F7M5. It contains seven predominant epitopes of FbaA identified by phage display technology, five non-tissue cross-reactive M protein fragments expressed on four selected serotypes prevalent in China, a Trojan antigen (TA) and a poly-alanine DR epitope (PADRE). BALB/c mice were immunized subcutaneously with F7M5 formulated with Freund's adjuvant, using recombinant FbaA and M protein in parallel as control. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), mouse immune sera were assayed for IgG titers, IgG subclasses, and binding of F7M5 with M1GAS. Results indicated that the multivalent vaccine was highly immunogenic and elicited a balanced IgG1/IgG2a response. We also tested the reactivity of F7M5 to antistreptolysin O (ASO) antibodies in sera of GAS-infected patients and found a 95.8% positive rate, indicating that the epitopes of the vaccine were widely expressed in the prevalent serotypes of GAS. More importantly, the F7M5 vaccine elicited strong protective immune responses against lethal-dose challenge with a survival rate of 90%, but induced no cross-reactions or pathological lesions in mouse model, suggesting that F7M5 can be further developed as an effective and safe anti-GAS vaccine.  ;polyalanine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

5499;10802317;Molecular characterization of a novel microneme antigen in Neospora caninum.;The apical complex of the parasites belonging to the phylum Sporozoa is believed to be critically involved in the events leading to host cell invasion. The characterization of the components of this subcellular structure is therefore an important step towards understanding how these parasites achieve host cell entry. Affinity-purification of an anti-Neospora caninum antiserum on a reactive protein band of approximately 40 kDa following Triton-X-114 extraction of parasite proteins, SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, yielded an immunoglobulin fraction which, by immunofluorescence, stained predominantly the apical portion of N. caninum tachyzoites. Following immunoscreening of a N. caninum tachyzoite lambdagt22 cDNA expression library, the respective full length cDNA sequence was determined. This sequence was found to encode a protein of 362 amino acids, with a calculated Mr of 38086. This protein is encoded by a single copy gene which produces a transcript of 2.4 kb. Sequence analysis showed that it contains a N-terminal putative signal peptide sequence and two potential membrane spanning regions. Four consecutive epidermal growth factor like domains were identified, as well a conserved sequence motif for binding of ATP/GTP (P-loop). The full length cDNA was expressed as a recombinant poly-histidine fusion protein in Escherichia coli, and antibodies affinity purified on this protein labelled exclusively a 38 kDa band on immunoblots of N. caninum extracts. In addition, specific labeling of a 45 kDa band in Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoite extracts was observed. By immunofluorescence, these antibodies stained predominantly the apical portion of both N. caninum and T. gondii tachyzoites, but the protein was absent from the parasite surface. Immunogold localization in LR-White embedded N. caninum tachyzoites demonstrated staining of predominantly the apically located micronemes, as well as of dense granules located at the posterior end of the tachyzoites. As evidenced by immunohistochemistry, this Neospora microneme antigen and its immunoreactive counterpart in Toxoplasma appeared to be expressed in both tachyzoite and bradyzoite stages. ;polyhistidine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

5505;27959372;Construction of a polyproline structure with hydrophobic exterior using octahydroindole-2-carboxylic acid.;The proline analogue (2S,3aS,7aS)-octahydroindole-2-carboxylic acid (Oic) has been previously applied as a proline substitute in pharmocologically active peptides and as a structural component of the antihypertensive drug Perindopril. Herein, we describe the formation of an oligoproline structure by an Oic oligomer. A series of Oic oligomers were investigated to show the structural and energetic contribution of appended residues to the structure. NMR investigation of these oligomers revealed an all-trans amide bond structure, and we provide evidence that a cascade-like mechanism is responsible for the all-trans folding cooperativity. X-ray crystallography of the Oic-hexapeptide clearly demonstrates that the all-trans structure of the Oic oligomer is a polyproline II helix. Thus, as a hydrophobic proline analog with a highly stable trans-amide bond, Oic represents an ideal building block for hydrophobic sites of polyproline II structures in biologically relevant contexts. ;polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function

Since increasing evidence suggests that lithium affects PKC function, we investigated the effects of 3 weeks of lithium administration on the immunolabeling of 4 PKC isozymes (alpha, beta, epsilon, and zeta) in particulate and soluble fractions from platelets of 7 patients with probable AD and 6 age-matched controls. AD patients had significantly less particulate or membrane-associated PKC zeta than normals during the placebo phase (P < 0.003). After 3 weeks of lithium treatment, AD patients had significantly less membrane-associated PKC alpha (P < 0.002), epsilon (P < 0.003), and zeta (P < 0.001) than normals. This is the first report of a difference in PKC in blood cells between AD and control subjects. These findings appear to indicate that some PKC isozymes may be differentially regulated in AD versus elderly controls, at least as evidenced in this peripheral cellular system.;-;-;-;hard_0
5510;35565585;A Refined Method for Studying Foraging Behaviour and Body Mass in Group-Housed European Starlings.;Laboratory experiments on passerine birds have been important for testing hypotheses regarding the effects of environmental variables on the adaptive regulation of body mass. However, previous work in this area has suffered from poor ecological validity and animal welfare due to the requirement to house birds individually in small cages to facilitate behavioural measurement and frequent catching for weighing. Here, we describe the social foraging system, a novel technology that permits continuous collection of individual-level data on operant foraging behaviour and body mass from group-housed European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). We report on the rapid acquisition of operant key pecking, followed by foraging and body mass data from two groups of six birds maintained on a fixed-ratio operant schedule under closed economy for 11 consecutive days. Birds gained 6.0 ± 1.2 g (mean ± sd) between dawn and dusk each day and lost an equal amount overnight. Individual daily mass gain trajectories were non-linear, with the rate of gain decelerating between dawn and dusk. Within-bird variation in daily foraging effort (key pecks) positively predicted within-bird variation in dusk mass. However, between-bird variation in mean foraging effort was uncorrelated with between-bird variation in mean mass, potentially indicative of individual differences in daily energy requirements. We conclude that the social foraging system delivers refined data collection and offers potential for improving our understanding of mass regulation in starlings and other species.;-;-;-;hard_0
5513;17360362;Evidence of spatially bound gene regulation in Mus musculus: decreased gene expression proximal to microRNA genomic location.;The extent, spatially and in time, of the phenomenon of localized decreased expression in the chromosomal vicinity of microRNA (miRNA) previously described in Caenorhabditis elegans is reproduced in Mus musculus across a wide range of tissues in several independent experiments. Computationally predicted miRNA targets are enriched in the vicinity of miRNAs, and transcription factors are identified as the class of genes that systematically exhibit this localized decrease. Also, those mRNA with AT-rich UTRs, particularly those that are not in the vicinity of CpG islands, most often exhibit this localized decrease. This localization broadens with the shift from developing to mature/differentiated tissues and suggests a developmentally controlled and spatially bound regulation. ;polythreonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
5514;9495587;Secondary structure formation in N-substituted peptides.;A systematic conformational analysis on several model peptides with N-substituted amino acids was performed on the basis of ab initio MO theory at the HF/6-31G* and HF/3-21G levels with inclusion of solvation effects to study the influence of N-substitution on the formation of typically secondary structural elements, e.g. beta sheets, helices and turns. The conformational flexibility of some structures was examined by means of molecular dynamics simulations in the gas phase and in solution. The results show a restriction of the conformational flexibility of the peptide chain after introduction of an N-substituted amino acid. N-substitution makes beta sheet formation more difficult. Several consecutive N-substituted amino acids in a sequence lead to conformers different from those found on the energy hypersurface of the corresponding N-unsubstituted peptides. There is a strong tendency to form periodically helical conformations, e.g. the polyglycine II or the alpha helix, which can be extended over several N-substituted amino acid residues. As long as 1<--4 hydrogen bond formation remains possible, the major types of beta turns can be formed with a distinct preference for the betaII and betaVIa turns. The betaI turn in particular is considerably destabilized. ;polyglycine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
5518;23072893;Development of cross-reactive antibodies to the proline-rich region of pneumococcal surface protein A in children.;Pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) is an important virulence factor of Streptococcus pneumoniae and a candidate for inclusion in future protein-based vaccines. The surface-exposed α-helical region of PspA is immunogenic and frequently cross-reactive, but also variable in structure. Sequence and serological differences in this region divide PspAs into two major families. We showed previously that children preferentially develop antibodies limited to the PspA family of the colonizing strain. In this study, sera of children with history of pneumococcal colonization were analyzed for presence of IgG antibodies to the conserved proline-rich region (PRR) of PspA. The results indicate that children produce antibodies to the PRR upon exposure to pneumococci. The PRR-specific antibodies were elicited regardless of the PspA family of the infecting strain. The results indicate that the PRR antigen elicits broadly cross-reactive antibodies that may have the potential to provide cross-protection against a broad spectrum of pneumococcal strains. ;polyproline;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
5519;7914370;Sequence-specific DNA binding of individual cut repeats of the human CCAAT displacement/cut homeodomain protein.;CCAAT displacement protein (CDP), a nuclear protein of 180-190 kDa, contains a triplicated motif, the cut domain, similar (80-90% conserved) to three repeats of 60-65 amino acids first identified in Drosophila cut, a homeo-domain protein involved in cell-fate decisions in development. Cut repeats bind DNA and exhibit subtle differences in target-site recognition. DNA sequences specifically bound by cut repeats were isolated by PCR-mediated DNA target-site selection. Sequences selected for cut repeat 2 and 3 (CR2 and CR3) binding are A+T-rich and favor an ATA motif with similar, but not identical, flanking base preferences. CR2 and CR3 discriminate among similar target sequences. CR1, which is more divergent from CR2 and CR3, displays the most restricted pattern of DNA sequence recognition. Methylation interference analysis demonstrates different protein-DNA contacts for CR1 and CR3 binding to a target sequence. Thus, CDP/cut is a complex protein whose DNA-binding properties reflect the combinatorial interaction of four domains (three cut repeats and one homeodomain) with target DNA sequences.;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
5521;16608856;Estrogen-occupied estrogen receptor represses cyclin G2 gene expression and recruits a repressor complex at the cyclin G2 promoter.;Estrogens, acting through their nuclear receptors have a broad impact on target cells, eliciting a transcriptional response program that involves gene repression as well as gene stimulation. While much is known about the mechanisms by which the estrogen-occupied estrogen receptor (ER) stimulates gene expression, the molecular events that lead to gene repression by the hormone-ER complex are largely unknown. Because estradiol represses expression of the cyclin G2 gene, which encodes a negative regulator of the cell cycle, our aim was to understand the mechanism by which cyclin G2 is repressed by estrogen. We show that cyclin G2 is a primary ER target gene in MCF-7 breast cancer cells that is rapidly and robustly down-regulated by estrogen. Promoter analysis reveals a responsive region containing a half-estrogen response element and GC-rich region that interact with ER and Sp1 proteins. Mutation of the half-ERE abrogates hormone-mediated repression. Mutational mapping of receptor reveals a requirement for its N-terminal region and DNA binding domain to support cyclin G2 repression. Following estradiol treatment of cells, chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses reveal recruitment of ER to the cyclin G2 regulatory region, dismissal of RNA polymerase II, and recruitment of a complex containing N-CoR and histone deacetylases, leading to a hypoacetylated chromatin state. Our study provides evidence for a mechanism by which the estrogen-occupied ER is able to actively repress gene expression in vivo and indicates a role for nuclear receptor corepressors and associated histone deacetylase activity in mediating negative gene regulation by this hormone-occupied nuclear receptor. ;polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
5523;9236342;Cooling gradients and formation of gaseous microemboli with cardiopulmonary bypass: an echocardiographic study.;"BACKGROUND
Previous studies demonstrated gas emboli formation during rewarming from hypothermia on cardiopulmonary bypass when the temperature gradient exceeded a critical threshold. It also has been suggested that formation of arterial gas emboli may occur during cooling on cardiopulmonary bypass when cooled oxygenated blood exiting the heat exchanger is warmed on mixture with the patient's blood. The purpose of this study was to determine under what circumstances gas emboli formation would occur during cooling on cardio-pulmonary bypass.


METHODS
Eight anesthetized mongreal dogs were placed on cardiopulmonary bypass using a roller pump, membrane oxygenator, and arterial line filter. For emboli detection, we positioned a transesophageal echocardiographic probe at the aortic arch distal to the aortic cannula and Doppler probes at the common carotid artery and the arterial line. Cooling gradients between normothermic blood and cooled arterial perfusate of 5 degrees, 10 degrees, 15 degrees, 20 degrees, and 0 degree C (isothermal controls) were investigated. In addition to preestablished temperature gradients, we investigated the effect of rapid cooling (maximal flow through the heat exchanger at a water bath temperature of 4 degrees C) after the initiation of normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass.


RESULTS
Minimal gas emboli were detected at the aortic arch at gradients of 10 degrees C or greater. The incidence of emboli was related directly to the magnitude of the temperature gradient (p < 0.01). No emboli were detected at the carotid artery. During rapid cooling, no emboli were observed either at the aorta or at the carotid artery.


CONCLUSIONS
Cooling gradients of 10 degrees C or greater may be associated with gas emboli formation, but they may be of limited clinical significance because no emboli were detected distal to the aortic arch. During the application of rapid cooling, no emboli formation was observed.";-;-;-;hard_0

5527;9465027;DNA-binding domains of Fos and Jun do not induce DNA curvature: an investigation with solution and gel methods.;We demonstrate the use of a DNA minicircle competition binding assay, together with DNA cyclization kinetics and gel-phasing methods, to show that the DNA-binding domains (dbd) of the heterodimeric leucine zipper protein Fos-Jun do not bend the AP-1 target site. Our DNA constructs contain an AP-1 site phased by 1-4 helical turns against an A-tract-directed bend. Competition binding experiments reveal that (dbd)Fos-Jun has a slight preference for binding to linear over circular AP-1 DNAs, independent of whether the site faces in or out on the circle. This result suggests that (dbd)Fos-Jun slightly stiffens rather than bends its DNA target site. A single A-tract bend replacing the AP-1 site is readily detected by its effect on cyclization kinetics, in contrast to the observations for Fos-Jun bound at the AP-1 locus. In contrast, comparative electrophoresis reveals that Fos-Jun-DNA complexes, in which the A-tract bend is positioned close (1-2 helical turns) to the AP-1 site, show phase-dependent variations in gel mobilities that are comparable with those observed when a single A-tract bend replaces the AP-1 site. Whereas gel mobility variations of Fos-Jun-DNA complexes decrease linearly with increasing Mg2+ contained in the gel, the solution binding preference of (dbd)Fos-Jun for linear over circular DNAs is independent of Mg2+ concentration. Hence, gel mobility variations of Fos-Jun-DNA complexes are not indicative of (dbd)Fos-Jun-induced DNA bending (upper limit 5 degrees) in the low salt conditions of gel electrophoresis. Instead, we propose that the gel anomalies depend on the steric relationship of the leucine zipper region with respect to a DNA bend. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

NK activity was studied against the 51Cr-radiolabelled Moloney virus-induced lymphoid cell line YAC 1, while IFN titres were determined by the inhibition of cytopathology of vesicular stomatitis virus on L929 cells, scored for CPE after 24 h from viral infection. A part of the lymphocytes from the spleen and bone marrow were incubated with different preselected doses (0.1, 1 and 10 micrograms/ml) of TP-5 for 1 h at 37 degrees C, and a part were left unincubated. At the end of the incubation time they were tested, without being washed, for NK activity and IFN production. TP-5 was able to significantly enhance (P less than 0.001 chi 2 test with Yate's correction) bone-marrow NK activity at a dose of 1 microgram/ml, while it was ineffective on spleen cells. A decrease of NK activity, seemingly due to a toxic effect, was observed both in bone-marrow and spleen lymphocytes, after incubation with a dose of 10 micrograms/ml. IFN production was not enhanced after exposure to TP-5. In all, our experiments suggest that TP-5 may enhance bone-marrow NK cells, perhaps by permitting the maturation of their precursors, as already known for T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Its effect is independent on IFN production and might be able to induce the rearrangement of certain surface specific receptors.;-;-;-;hard_0
5531;8223887;Nitric oxide modulates responses to sensory nerve activation of the perfused rat mesentery.;The modulatory actions of nitric oxide on sensory nerves were investigated on dilator responses of the perfused rat mesentery to transmural nerve stimulation. N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis, caused a significant augmentation of vasodilator responses to transmural nerve stimulation, an effect which was abolished by L-arginine. L-NAME had no effect on vasodilator responses to exogenous calcitonin gene-related peptide. In preparations without endothelium L-NAME still caused potentiation of vasodilator responses to transmural nerve stimulation. Methylene blue, an inhibitor of guanylate cyclase, also significantly enhanced vasodilator responses to transmural nerve stimulation. After pretreatment with diethyldithiocarbamate to inhibit superoxide dismutase, vasodilator responses to transmural nerve stimulation were also potentiated. This response was abolished by exogenous superoxide dismutase. These findings suggest that endogenous nitric oxide modulates, in an inhibitory fashion, the actions of sensory nerves in the rat mesentery. The results also suggest that endogenous superoxide dismutase may participate in the regulation of the actions of sensory nerves via control of cellular superoxide anion level.;-;-;-;hard_0
5533;9338537;Efficacy of antihistamine pretreatment in the prevention of adverse reactions to Hymenoptera immunotherapy: a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.;"BACKGROUND
Some clinical studies suggest that a combination of an H1- and H2-antagonist may be effective in the prophylaxis of allergic reactions.


OBJECTIVE
The efficacy of pretreatment with an H1/H2-antagonist combination, H1-antagonist alone, or placebo in the prophylaxis of local and systemic adverse reactions to specific immunotherapy with Hymenoptera venom was compared.


METHODS
In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 121 patients with Hymenoptera venom allergy were treated with rush immunotherapy and pretreatment with one of the following: 120 mg of terfenadine plus 300 mg of ranitidine, 120 mg of terfenadine alone, or placebo. The incidence of unwanted systemic adverse and local reactions was recorded for up to 50 weeks.


RESULTS
In seven patients (6%), six in the placebo group and one in the terfenadine group, systemic side effects required cessation of therapy (p = 0.005). Subjective symptoms occurred in four patients (10%) in the terfenadine plus ranitidine group and in three patients (7%) in the terfenadine group. Regarding local reactions, significantly fewer patients treated with a combination of terfenadine and ranitidine and with terfenadine alone as compared with placebo had severe local symptoms of erythema (29%, 29%, and 49%), edema (24%, 18%, and 41%), and pruritus (13%, 11%, and 31%) at week 1 (p < 0.05). This therapeutic benefit was limited to the first 4 weeks of treatment. Treatment with a combination of terfenadine and ranitidine was not superior to treatment with terfenadine alone.


CONCLUSIONS
Pretreatment with H1-antihistamines with or without H2-antihistamines significantly reduced local and systemic adverse reactions to immunotherapy with Hymenoptera venom and may therefore be helpful in the management of immunotherapy.";-;-;-;hard_0

5539;8172605;Purification and properties of rat cysteine-rich intestinal protein.;Cysteine-rich intestinal protein (CRIP) is a zinc-binding protein where the binding domain is in the so-called LIM double zinc finger motif. Methods are described for the preparation of CRIP from rat small intestine. Gel-filtration and ion-exchange chromatography and preparative PAGE gave homogeneous CRIP, based upon analytical PAGE, mass spectrometry and microsequencing. Initial localization of CRIP during chromatography was based on binding of 65Zn radioisotope introduced into the intestine. The stoichiometry of binding by CRIP is less than 2 atoms of zinc per molecule. The metal-binding affinity in vitro is zinc > cadmium > copper > iron, at low metal concentrations. Zinc is the predominant metal bound when these metals are taken up from the intestinal lumen. Zinc binding was not influenced by pH between values of 4.5 to 7.5. Metallothionein has a much greater zinc-binding affinity than CRIP. The tissue concentration of CRIP is of the order of 15-20 micrograms/g of mucosal tissue, suggesting that the protein is more abundant than zinc-finger-containing transcription factors. The metal-binding properties of CRIP are consistent with proposed zinc-related functions for this cytoplasmic protein, which is expressed in the small intestine during the postnatal period. ;polycysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function

5542;24151080;Slippery substrates impair ATP-dependent protease function by slowing unfolding.;ATP-dependent proteases are responsible for most energy-dependent protein degradation across all species. Proteases initially bind an unstructured region on a substrate and then translocate along the polypeptide chain, unfolding and degrading protein domains as they are encountered. Although this process is normally processive, resulting in the complete degradation of substrate proteins to small peptides, some substrates are released prematurely. Regions of low sequence complexity within the substrate such as the glycine-rich region (GRR) from p105 or glycine-alanine repeats (GAr) from the EBNA1 (Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen-1) protein, can trigger partial degradation and fragment release. Loss of processivity could be due to inability to hold on to the substrate (faster release) or inability to unfold and degrade a substrate domain (slower unfolding). I previously showed that the GRR slows domain unfolding by the proteasome (Kraut, D. A., Israeli, E., Schrader, E. K., Patil, A., Nakai, K., Nanavati, D., Inobe, T., and Matouschek, A. (2012) ACS Chem. Biol. 7, 1444-1453). In contrast, a recently published study concluded that GArs increase the rate of substrate release from ClpXP, a bacterial ATP-dependent protease (Too, P. H., Erales, J., Simen, J. D., Marjanovic, A., and Coffino, P. (2013) J. Biol. Chem. 288, 13243-13257). Here, I show that these apparently contradictory results can be reconciled through a reanalysis of the ClpXP GAr data. This reanalysis shows that, as with the proteasome, low complexity sequences in substrates slow their unfolding and degradation by ClpXP, with little effect on release rates.

Similar repeats were also detected in other fowlpox virus strains, suggesting that they might confer a selective advantage to the virus. The molloscum contagiosum virus homolog (MC107L) also contains repeats, unlike the vaccinia virus protein. The number of repeats in the fowlpox virus protein does not seem to be crucial, since some strains have a different number of repeats, as shown by the difference in the size of the protein in these strains. The repeat region could be deleted, indicating that it is not essential for replication in vitro. It was not possible to delete the entire 39K protein, indicating that it was essential (transcriptional control signals for the flanking genes were left intact). The repeat region is partly responsible for the immunodominance of the protein, but the C-terminal part of the protein also contains highly antigenic linear epitopes. A role for the 39K protein in immune system modulation is discussed.;polyserine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
5546;8786948;Influence of Trichoderma viride enzyme complex on nutrient utilization and performance of laying hens in diets with and without antibiotic supplementation.;"The experiment was designed to test possible interactions of an enzyme complex (product from Trichoderma viride) and a feed antibiotic (flavophospholipol) in a barley diet on metabolism variables and egg production performance of Warren Brown laying hens. The basal diet contained 40% winter barley (French cultivar ""Express"", six row). The four treatments were as follows: O, control (without supplement); E, enzyme complex, 600 ppm; A, flavophospholipol, 10 ppm; EA, enzyme complex, 600 ppm and flavophospholipol, 10 ppm. The enzyme complex contained the following main activities: cellulase (10,500 U/g), endo-beta-(1:3)(1:4)-glucanase (24,000 U/g), and xylanase (32,000 U/g). The enzyme positively influenced AME content of the feed, organic matter (OM) utilization, and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) degradability (P < or = 0.01). When supplemented alone, the antibiotic had no influence on energy and nutrient utilization. No significant differences in egg production due to dietary treatments were observed. A significant enzyme by antibiotic interaction for AME (P < or = 0.01) and OM utilization (P < or = 0.001) as well as NDF degradability (P < or = 0.01) indicated a reduced enzyme effect in the diet containing antibiotic. Negative enzyme by antibiotic interaction for energy utilization in laying hens suggested that the positive response to dietary enzyme supplementation in the mature laying hen (Treatment O vs E) was to great extent mediated by the activity of intestinal microbes.";-;-;-;hard_0
5548;8951423;Differential depletion of human respiratory tract antioxidants in response to ozone challenge.;The toxicity of ozone, the major component of photochemical smog, is related to its powerful oxidising ability, and many of its deleterious effects are mediated through free radical reactions. As the majority of ozone oxidation events are thought to be confined to the pulmonary epithelial lining fluid, we studied the interaction of ozone with a range of small molecular weight antioxidants found within this compartment: ascorbic acid (AH2), uric acid (UA), and reduced glutathione (GSH). Epithelial lining fluid obtained as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, was taken from 16 male subjects and the antioxidant concentrations determined for each subject. BAL fluid samples from nine of these subjects were then exposed, using an interfacial exposure system, to a range (50-1000 ppb) of ozone concentrations. Both AH2 and UA were consumed by ozone in a time and ozone concentration dependent manner, with mean consumption rates of 1.7 +/- 0.8 and 1.0 +/- 0.5 pmol L-1 s-1 ppb-1, respectively. Considerable intersubject variation was however observed. The individual rates of consumption for each antioxidant were significantly correlated with the respective initial antioxidant concentration. In contrast, although GSH was consumed at 50 ppb ozone, the rate of consumption did not change with increasing ozone concentration. We conclude that there is differential depletion of BAL fluid antioxidants, suggesting a reactivity hierarchy toward ozone in human ELF of AH2 > UA > > GSH.;-;-;-;hard_0
5549;9777179;Predictors of differential response to clozapine and haloperidol. Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study Group on Clozapine in Refractory Schizophrenia.;"BACKGROUND
We sought to identify baseline predictors of response to clozapine.


METHODS
Data were from a 15-site randomized clinical trial comparing clozapine and haloperidol in hospitalized patients with refractory schizophrenia (n = 423). Three-month outcomes were analyzed with the full sample (n = 368 due to attrition). Because of crossovers, analyses of 12-month outcomes were conducted with crossovers excluded (n = 291). Clinical predictors included age, race, diagnosis (current substance abuse, paranoid subtype of schizophrenia, or depressive syndrome), severity of symptoms, quality of life, age at onset of schizophrenia, extrapyramidal symptoms, and VA compensation payment. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine the interaction of treatment condition and each of these variables in predicting outcomes for symptoms, quality of life, side effects, and days hospitalized.


RESULTS
Patients with higher quality of life at baseline (p = .04) and higher symptoms (p = .02) had relatively smaller declines in hospital days at 6 months. In the 12-month sample patients with higher levels of symptoms had greater symptom reductions at 12 months (p = .03) and greater improvement in quality of life (p = .004).


CONCLUSIONS
Although high levels of symptoms were associated with greater improvement on clozapine, these findings are not robust enough to suggest that any specific, clinically defined subgroup of refractory patients should be preferentially targeted for clozapine treatment.";-;-;-;hard_0

Following intravenous administration, iomeprol did not bind measurably to plasma proteins and was rapidly excreted in unchanged form, mostly through the kidneys. The compound was rapidly distributed to the plasma and thence to the extracellular spaces. Iomeprol did not accumulate in specific organs or tissues except for those involved in its elimination, i.e. the kidneys and the liver. However, 24 h after administration, less than 1% of the injected dose remained in the tissues. The overall profile was very similar to the published profiles of other radiographic contrast agents used in uroangiography.;-;-;-;hard_0
5554;1654441;Cloning of the latency gene and the early protein 0 gene of pseudorabies virus.;A collection of overlapping cDNA clones encoding the latency transcript of pseudorabies virus and the DNA nucleotide sequence of the latency gene has been obtained. The transcript is spliced with 4.6 kb of intervening sequences. This mRNA, designated the large latency transcript, is 8.5 kb. It is polyadenylated and contains a large open reading frame capable of coding for a 200-kDa polypeptide. The direction of transcription is antiparallel to that of the immediate-early gene IE180 and a newly identified early gene, EP0. The latency transcript overlaps the entire IE180 gene and most of the EP0 gene. The EP0 mRNA is 1.75 kb and polyadenylated. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed the presence of cysteine-rich zinc finger domain similar to that of the immediate-early gene ICP0 of herpes simplex virus type 1 and the gene 61 polypeptide of varicella-zoster virus. On the basis of the biological functions, conserved protein domains, and unique spatial arrangements of the homologous polypeptides (IE180 versus ICP4 and EP0 versus ICP0) between pseudorabies virus and herpes simplex virus type 1, it is predicted that a homologous protein domain is also encoded by the 8.5-kb large latency transcripts of these two viruses.;polycysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
5558;8179240;[Immunoglobulins in hematology. Peripheral neuropathy associated with monoclonal IgM].;Peripheral neuropathy is often associated with a monoclonal IgM and occurs in about 3% of authentic Waldenström macroglobulinemias. In at least as many cases, the neuropathy is associated with a monoclonal IgM although lymphoplasmocyte proliferation is not detected, at least initially. In about 2/3 of the cases, the monoclonal IgM is a specific antibody against a myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG), two peripheral nerve glycolipids (SGPG and SGLPG), the peripheral nerve protein P0, other smaller molecular weight molecules of the peripheral nerves, or finally certain adhesion proteins such as N-CAM. All these IgM have a fine specificity against an epitope of the glucuronyl sulfate determinant present on the carbohydrate moiety of these proteins. The clinical manifestations are similar in all patients with sensorimotor polyneuropathy, with frequent sensory dominance and demyelinization. Atypical symptoms including motor dominance, paralysis of the cranial nerves, asymmetric forms, are rare. On histological examination, there is demyelinization and monoclonal IgM deposit along the nerve fibers. Passive in vivo and in vitro transfer experiences suggest that these monoclonal antibodies can play a role in triggering or maintaining the peripheral neuropathy. Despite identical or nearly identical antibody specificities of the monoclonal IgMs, the regions of the heavy or light chains involved vary from one patient to another, indicating that the glucoronyl sulfate determinant is quite variable. This variability is not found in other monoclonal autoantibody models with autoantibody activity such as the rheumatoid factor or cold agglutinins. These data would suggest the need for different therapeutic approaches using chemotherapy, plasmapheresis, high dose intravenous immunoglobulins and other immunomodulator treatments.

5559;17146667;Identification and characterization of two uvrA genes of Xanthomonas axonopodis pathovar citri.;Two uvrA-like genes, designated uvrA1 and uvrA2, that may be involved in nucleotide excision repair in Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri (X. a. pv. citri) strain XW47 were characterized. The uvrA1 gene was found to be 2,964 bp in length capable of encoding a protein of 987 amino acids. The uvrA2 gene was determined to be 2,529 bp with a coding potential of 842 amino acids. These two proteins share 71 and 39% identity, respectively, in amino acid sequence with the UvrA protein of Escherichia coli. Analyses of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed that UvrA1 and UvrA2 have structures characteristic of UvrA proteins, including the Walker A and Walker B motifs, zinc finger DNA binding domains, and helix-turn-helix motif with a polyglycine hinge region. The uvrA1 or uvrA2 mutant, constructed by gene replacement, was more sensitive to DNA-damaging agents methylmethane sulfonate (MMS), mitomycin C (MMC), or ultraviolet (UV) than the wild type. The uvrA1 mutant was four orders of magnitude more sensitive to UV irradiation and two orders of magnitude more sensitive to MMS than the uvrA2 mutant. The uvrA1uvrA2 double mutant was one order of magnitude more sensitive to MMS, MMC, or UV than the uvrA1 single mutant. These results suggest that UvrA1 plays a more important role than UvrA2 in DNA repair in X. a. pv. citri. Both uvrA1 and uvrA2 genes were found to be constitutively expressed in the wild type and lexA1 or lexA2 mutant of X. a. pv. citri, and treatment of these cells with sublethal dose of MMC did not alter the expression of these two genes. Results of electrophoresis mobility shift assays revealed that LexA1 or LexA2 does not bind to either the uvrA1 or the uvrA2 promoter. These results suggest that uvrA expression in X. a. pv. citri is not regulated by the SOS response system. ;polyglycine;helix;-;LCR_with_function

Thirty-nine participants with, DSM-III-R schizophrenia listened to two stories and answered a series of questions after each story. We manipulated two factors: (1) the presence of context before the stories (to influence generating a discourse plan); and (2) question type (structured vs. unstructured; designed to influence maintaining a discourse plan). Consistent with our hypotheses, low context was associated with less verbose and syntactically complex speech.

5567;17694175;A distal single nucleotide polymorphism alters long-range regulation of the PU.1 gene in acute myeloid leukemia.;Targeted disruption of a highly conserved distal enhancer reduces expression of the PU.1 transcription factor by 80% and leads to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with frequent cytogenetic aberrations in mice. Here we identify a SNP within this element in humans that is more frequent in AML with a complex karyotype, leads to decreased enhancer activity, and reduces PU.1 expression in myeloid progenitors in a development-dependent manner. This SNP inhibits binding of the chromatin-remodeling transcriptional regulator special AT-rich sequence binding protein 1 (SATB1). Overexpression of SATB1 increased PU.1 expression, and siRNA inhibition of SATB1 downregulated PU.1 expression. Targeted disruption of the distal enhancer led to a loss of regulation of PU.1 by SATB1. Interestingly, disruption of SATB1 in mice led to a selective decrease of PU.1 RNA in specific progenitor types (granulocyte-macrophage and megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors) and a similar effect was observed in AML samples harboring this SNP. Thus we have identified a SNP within a distal enhancer that is associated with a subtype of leukemia and exerts a deleterious effect through remote transcriptional dysregulation in specific progenitor subtypes. ;polythreonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
5573;7568217;Transcription termination of RNA polymerase I due to a T-rich element interacting with Reb1p.;All transcription terminators for RNA polymerase I (pol I) that have been studied so far, ranging from yeast to humans, require a specific DNA binding protein to cause termination. In yeast, this terminator protein has been identified as Reb1p. We now show that, in addition to the binding site for Reb1p, the yeast pol I terminator also requires the presence of a T-rich region coding for the last 12 nucleotides of the transcript. Reb1p cooperates with this T-rich element, both to pause the polymerase and to effect release of the transcript. These findings have implications for the termination mechanism used by all three nuclear RNA polymerases, since all three are known to pause at this terminator.;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Specific polyclonal antibodies were elicited against purified mouse liver H1o and chicken erythrocyte H5, and applied for the further characterization of the chicken H1 subfractions obtained chromatographically. The results from microcomplement fixation and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays showed that the presumptive chicken liver H1o shared common antigenic determinants with the mammalian H1o and the chicken liver H5. Based on the combined biochemical and immunological evidence, we conclude that an H1o-like protein is present in quiescent differentiated avian cells. The data of Smith et al.

5578;8610905;The in vitro effects of phosphodiesterase inhibitors on the human internal mammary artery.;"The internal mammary artery (IMA) is the preferred conduit for myocardial revascularization, but it changes diameter in response to injury or thromboxane release to decrease myocardial blood supply. Papaverine, a phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor, is injected in the IMA bed during surgery to prevent spasm. We evaluated the ability of papaverine and cyclic adenosine monophosphate PDE Type III (cAMP-PDE) inhibitors (amrinone, enoximone, and milrinone) in vitro to reverse the constriction of human IMA rings, induced by a thromboxane A2 analog, U46619, and evaluated amrinone's ability to modify the constricting effect of norepinephrine (NE). All cAMP-PDE inhibitors produced complete relaxation of U46619-induced contractions. The contractions necessary to produce 50% relaxation (EC50) were within therapeutic ranges. The vasodilatory potency of amrinone was greater after NE than after U46619 (EC50, 1.9 +/- 0.5 vs 4.3 +/- 2.2 x 10(-5)M; mean +/- SD; P < 0.05). Response to constriction after a submaximal dose of NE was attenuated to 38% (P < 0.001) from that observed in the control rings by a pretreatment with amrinone. These results suggest that cAMP-PDE inhibitors have the potential utility to reverse IMA spasm, and represent a potential therapeutic modality for IMA spasm after myocardial revascularization.";-;-;-;hard_0

In order to obtain a physical basis for a definite temperature rise at a certain depths in the human body a human cadaver study in situ was conducted. A set of 16 experiments was carried out with an ultrasound frequency of 1 and 3 MHz. For each frequency the pulsed and continuous mode of energy delivery were compared at a variable intensity of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 W/cm2. The ultrasonic energy was delivered in direct contact to the cadaver at the posterior crural compartment of the leg in a static manner.

5580;11830467;A functional platelet fibrinogen receptor with a deletion in the cysteine-rich repeat region of the beta(3) integrin: the Oe(a) alloantigen in neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia.;This report describes a new low-frequency alloantigen, Oe(a), responsible for a case of neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (NAIT). In a population study none of 600 unrelated blood donors was an Oe(a) carrier. By immunochemical studies the Oe(a) antigen could be assigned to platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIIa. Sequencing of GPIIIa complementary DNA from an Oe(a) (+) individual showed deletion of a lysine residue at position 611 (DeltaLys(611)). Analysis of 20 Oe(a) (-) and 3 Oe(a) (+) individuals showed that the DeltaLys(611) form of GPIIIa was related to the phenotype. Anti-Oe(a) reacted with the DeltaLys(611), but not with the wild-type isoforms on stable transfectants expressing GPIIIa, indicating that DeltaLys(611) directly induces the expression of Oe(a) epitopes. Under nonreducing conditions the Pro(33)DeltaLys(611) variant migrated with a slightly decreased molecular weight compared to the Pro(33)Lys(611) isoform suggesting that DeltaLys(611) has an influence on the disulfide bonds of GPIIIa. The Pro(33)DeltaLys(611) GPIIIa could undergo conformational changes and bind to fibrinogen in a similar manner as the Pro(33)Lys(611) isoform. No difference was found in the tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125(FAK), suggesting that DeltaLys(611) has no effect on integrin function. In contrast to all other low-frequency antigens, the DeltaLys(611) isoform was associated with the HPA-1b, but not with the high frequency HPA-1a allele. Comparison with GPIIIa DNA from nonhuman primates indicated that the HPA-1a allele represents the ancestral form of GPIIIa. It can be assumed that the Oe(a) form did arise as a result of a mutational event from an already mutated GPIIIa allele. ;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
5581;25076939;Omega-3 Fatty Acids and FFAR4.;The beneficial roles of omega-3 fatty acids (ω3-FAs) on obesity, type 2 diabetes, and other metabolic diseases are well known. Most of these effects can be explained by their anti-inflammatory effects triggered through their receptor, free fatty acid receptor 4 (FFAR4) activation. Although the whole mechanism of action is not fully described yet, it has been shown that stimulation of ω3-FA to FFAR4 is followed by receptor phosphorylation. This makes FFAR4 to be capable of interacting with β-arrestin-2, which in turn, results in association of β-arrestin-2 with TAB1. This stealing of an important partaker of the inflammatory cascade leads to interruption of the pathway, resulting in reduced inflammation. Besides this regulation of the anti-inflammatory response, FFAR4 signaling also has been shown to regulate glucose homeostasis, adiposity, gastrointestinal peptide secretion, and taste preference. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about the interaction of ω3-FAs with FFAR4 and the consequent opportunities for the application of ω3-FAs and possible FFAR4 targets.;-;-;-;hard_0

However, the control of 3D-complex microactuation is still challenging due to the difficulty in design of nonuniform internal stress of micro/nanostructures. Here, we develop in-gel direct laser writing (in-gel DLW) procedure offering a high resolution inscription whereby the two materials, resin and hydrogel, are interpenetrated on a scale smaller than the wavelength of the light. The 3D position and mechanical properties of the inscribed structures could be tailored to a resolution better than 100 nm over a wide density range. These provide an unparalleled means of inscribing a freely suspended microstructures of a second material like a skeleton into the hydrogel body and also to direct isotropic volume changes to bending and distortion motions. In the combination with a thermosensitive hydrogel rather small temperature variations could actuate large amplitude motions. This generates complex modes of motion through the rational engineering of the stresses present in the multicomponent material. More sophisticated folding design would realize a multiple, programmable actuation of soft materials. This method inspired by biological system may offer the possibility for functional soft materials capable of biomimetic actuation and photonic crystal application.;-;-;-;hard_0

5591;8052537;Single strand and double strand DNA damage-induced reciprocal recombination in yeast. Dependence on nucleotide excision repair and RAD1 recombination.;"Single strand and double strand DNA damage-induced recombination were compared in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The non-replicating plasmid pUC18-HIS3 was damaged in vitro and introduced into yeast cells; plasmid-chromosome recombinants were selected as stable His+ transformants. Single strand damage was produced by UV irradiation at 254 nm or by psoralen photoreaction at 390 nm. Double strand damage was produced by psoralen photoreaction at 350 nm or by restriction endonuclease digestion. Recombinants were classified as resulting from gene conversion without crossing over, single plasmid integration, or multiple plasmid integration. Single and double strand DNA damage produced different patterns of recombination. In repair proficient cells double strand damage induced primarily multiple plasmid integrations, while single strand damage induced higher proportions of gene conversions and single integrations. Reciprocal recombination depended on the RAD1 gene, which is involved in both excision repair and recombination; plasmid integration induced by all forms of damage was decreased in a rad1 disruption strain. Mutation of the RAD3 excision repair gene decreased plasmid integration induced by far UV irradiation and psoralen crosslinks, but not by double strand breaks, which are not substrates of nucleotide excision repair. Double strand break-induced plasmid integration was also decreased by disruption of RAD10, which forms a complex with RAD1; disruption of RAD4 had no effect. Thus, while nucleotide excision repair genes are involved in the processing of damaged DNA to generate recombination intermediates, RAD1 and RAD10 are additionally involved in reciprocal exchange.";-;-;-;hard_0
5593;21808065;Arginine methylation of the nuclear poly(a) binding protein weakens the interaction with its nuclear import receptor, transportin.;The nuclear poly(A) binding protein, PABPN1, promotes mRNA polyadenylation in the cell nucleus by increasing the processivity of poly(A) polymerase and contributing to poly(A) tail length control. In its C-terminal domain, the protein carries 13 arginine residues that are all asymmetrically dimethylated. The function of this modification in PABPN1 has been unknown. Part of the methylated domain serves as nuclear localization signal, binding the import receptor transportin. Here we report that arginine methylation weakens the affinity of PABPN1 for transportin. Recombinant, unmethylated PABPN1 binds more strongly to transportin than its methylated counterpart from mammalian tissue, and in vitro methylation reduces the affinity. Transportin and RNA compete for binding to PABPN1. Methylation favors RNA binding. Transportin also inhibits in vitro methylation of the protein. Finally, a peptide corresponding to the nuclear localization signal of PABPN1 competes with transportin-dependent nuclear import of the protein in a permeabilized cell assay and does so less efficiently when it is methylated. We hypothesize that transportin binding might delay methylation of PABPN1 until after nuclear import. In the nucleus, arginine methylation may favor the transition of PABPN1 to the competing ligand RNA and serve to reduce the risk of the protein being reexported to the cytoplasm by transportin. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
5595;32601564;Endovascular Treatment of Giant Intracranial Aneurysms.;"Objective Giant intracranial aneurysms (GIAs) are associated with a high risk of rupture and have a high mortality rate when they rupture (65-100%). The traditional microsurgical approach to secure these lesions is challenging, and as such endovascular embolization has been increasingly selected as a treatment option. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients with ruptured and unruptured GIAs at three medical centers from October 2008 to April 2016. Clinical follow-up and digital subtraction angiography were conducted at six months post-treatment. Chi-square analysis was used to determine differences in outcomes between anterior and posterior circulation aneurysms and if a pipeline embolization device (PED) provided favorable outcomes in unruptured GIAs. Results A total of 45 consecutive patients (mean/median age = 57/59; range: 16-82 years) were included. The mean/median aneurysm size was 29.9/28.3 mm (range: 25-50 mm). Eight (18%) patients presented with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and 37 (82%) with unruptured GIAs. Twenty-eight (62%) were treated with a PED: 11 (24.4%) with one PED, 1 (2.2%) with PED + coils, 11 (24.4%) with more than one PED, and 5 (13.5%) with multiple PED + coils. The overall mortality rate was 3/45 (6.7%). No deaths were procedure-related. Five (11.1%) patients experienced ischemic stroke but only 2 had a 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of ≥3. Of 33 patients available for six-month angiography, Raymond scale (RS) scores were 1, 2, and 3 for 23/45 (70%), 7/45 (20.9%), and 3/45 (9.1%), respectively. Chi-square test demonstrated that overall, anterior circulation GIAs had better clinical (mRS score) and radiographic (RS score) outcomes than posterior GIAs. PED alone provided similar clinical mRS outcomes but had a higher rate of complete occlusion at six months compared with PED + coils and coils alone in unruptured GIAs (p < 0.05). Conclusions Endovascular embolization using PED or PED + coils appears to be a moderately safe and effective treatment option for patients with GIAs.";-;-;-;hard_0

5598;26344833;Role of the α Clamp in the Protein Translocation Mechanism of Anthrax Toxin.;"Membrane-embedded molecular machines are utilized to move water-soluble proteins across these barriers. Anthrax toxin forms one such machine through the self-assembly of its three component proteins--protective antigen (PA), lethal factor, and edema factor. Upon endocytosis into host cells, acidification of the endosome induces PA to form a membrane-inserted channel, which unfolds lethal factor and edema factor and translocates them into the host cytosol. Translocation is driven by the proton motive force, composed of the chemical potential, the proton gradient (ΔpH), and the membrane potential (Δψ). A crystal structure of the lethal toxin core complex revealed an ""α clamp"" structure that binds to substrate helices nonspecifically. Here, we test the hypothesis that, through the recognition of unfolding helical structure, the α clamp can accelerate the rate of translocation. We produced a synthetic PA mutant in which an α helix was crosslinked into the α clamp to block its function. This synthetic construct impairs translocation by raising a yet uncharacterized translocation barrier shown to be much less force dependent than the known unfolding barrier. We also report that the α clamp more stably binds substrates that can form helices than those, such as polyproline, that cannot. Hence, the α clamp recognizes substrates by a general shape-complementarity mechanism. Substrates that are incapable of forming compact secondary structure (due to the introduction of a polyproline track) are severely deficient for translocation. Therefore, the α clamp and its recognition of helical structure in the translocating substrate play key roles in the molecular mechanism of protein translocation.

5599;19278650;Kinase domain insertions define distinct roles of CLK kinases in SR protein phosphorylation.;Splicing requires reversible phosphorylation of serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins, which direct splice site selection in eukaryotic mRNA. These phosphorylation events are dependent on SR protein (SRPK) and cdc2-like kinase (CLK) families. SRPK1 phosphorylation of splicing factors is restricted by a specific docking interaction whereas CLK activity is less constrained. To understand functional differences between splicing factor targeting kinases, we determined crystal structures of CLK1 and CLK3. Intriguingly, in CLKs the SRPK1 docking site is blocked by insertion of a previously unseen helix alphaH. In addition, substrate docking grooves present in related mitogen activating protein kinases (MAPKs) are inaccessible due to a CLK specific beta7/8-hairpin insert. Thus, the unconstrained substrate interaction together with the determined active-site mediated substrate specificity allows CLKs to complete the functionally important hyperphosphorylation of splicing factors like ASF/SF2. In addition, despite high sequence conservation, we identified inhibitors with surprising isoform specificity for CLK1 over CLK3. ;polyarginine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
5600;15300592;KLF11 mediates a critical mechanism in TGF-beta signaling that is inactivated by Erk-MAPK in pancreatic cancer cells.;Smad-regulated transcription plays a central role in transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta-induced cell growth inhibition and tumor suppression. Like the Smads, KLF11 is an early response transcription factor that mediates TGF-beta-induced growth inhibition in untransformed epithelial cells. Here, we investigated the functional implications of KLF11 in TGF-beta signaling and transcription in normal epithelial as well as pancreatic cancer cells. The effects of KLF11 on TGF-beta signaling and transcription were examined on the levels of reporter transactivation, Smad2 phosphorylation, and expression of endogenous TGF-beta-regulated genes. Promoter analysis, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and coimmunoprecipitation studies were performed to study KLF11-induced and mSin3A corepressor-mediated repression of Smad7. Erk-induced KLF11 phosphorylation was examined in vitro and in vivo, and its impact on KLF11-mSin3A-mediated Smad7 repression was verified in pancreatic cancer cells using site-directed mutagenesis. KLF11 potentiates TGF-beta signaling by terminating the inhibitory Smad7 loop. Mechanistically, KLF11 represses TGF-beta-induced transcription from the Smad7 promoter by recruiting mSin3a via GC-rich sites. This function is inhibited in pancreatic cancer cells with oncogenic Ras mutations, in which Erk/mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylates KLF11, leading to disruption of KLF11-mSin3a interaction. Expression of an Erk-insensitive KLF11 mutant restores both mSin3a binding and Smad7 repression and results in enhanced TGF-beta signaling in pancreatic cancer cells. These results define a novel mechanism in TGF-beta-regulated gene expression. KLF11 potentiates Smad-signaling activity in normal epithelial cells through termination of the negative feedback loop imposed by Smad7. The fact that this function of KLF11 is inhibited by oncogenic Erk/mitogen-activated protein kinase in pancreatic cancer cells emphasizes the importance of this mechanism for oncogenesis. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
5603;27003293;An Engineered Endomorphin-2 Gene for Morphine Withdrawal Syndrome.;An optimal therapeutics to manage opioid withdrawal syndrome is desired for opioid addiction treatment. Down-regulation of endogenous endomorphin-2 (EM2) level in the central nervous system after continuous morphine exposure was observed, which suggested that increase of EM2 could be an alternative novel method for opioid dependence. As a short peptide, the short half-life of EM2 limits its clinical usage through conventional administration. In the present study, we engineered an EM2 gene using a signal peptide of mouse growth factor for an out-secretory expression of EM2 and an adenovirus as a vector, which ultimately sustained the release of EM-2. After administration of the adenovirus in central nervous system, a sustained increase of EM2 level in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) was observed along with a reduction of morphine withdrawal syndrome. These findings suggest that the engineered EM2 gene delivered to the central nervous system could be a novel therapeutics for withdrawal syndrome in opioid dependent subjects.;-;-;-;hard_0

The 5' end of the BAF60b gene was heterogeneous and the longest gene was 9060 bp long with 13 exons. The largest of all exons was estimated to be 2774 bases. Deduced rat BAF60b protein was made of 531 amino acids and its amino acid sequence was 97% identical with the human counterpart. No TATA box was found up to the -100 bp region but five GC boxes corresponding to the Sp1 binding site were observed up to 640 bp upstream from the transcriptional start site. Sixty-three bases downstream from the BAF60b gene, the polyadenylation site of the gene encoding transcription factor SUG/proteasome p45, whose expression is constant in many tissues, was identified.

5605;8995238;Activation of transcription of the melanoma inducing Xmrk oncogene by a GC box element.;Melanoma formation in Xiphophorus is caused by overexpression of the Xmrk gene. The promoter region of the Xmrk oncogene differs strikingly from the corresponding proto-oncogenic sequences and was acquired in the course of a nonhomologous recombination with another gene locus, D. In order to identify regulatory elements leading to the strong transcriptional activation of Xmrk in melanoma tissue and to contribute to an understanding of the role the regulatory locus R might play in suppressing the tumor phenotype in wild-type Xiphophorus, we performed functional analysis of the Xmrk oncogene promoter. Transient transfections in melanoma and nonmelanoma cells revealed the existence of a potent positive regulatory element positioned close to the transcriptional start site. Contained within this promoter segment is a GC-rich sequence identical to the binding site described for human Sp1. In vitro binding studies and biochemical characterizations demonstrated the existence of GC-binding proteins in fish that share immunological properties with members of the human Sp family of transcription factors and appear to be involved in the high transcriptional activation of the Xmrk oncogene. Since the identified cis element is functional in both melanoma and nonmelanoma cells, additional silencer elements suppressing Xmrk expression in nonpigment cells must exist, thereby suggesting a negative regulatory function for the genetically defined R locus.;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
5606;3462247;Construction of chain- and locus-specific HLA class II DNA probes. Study of HLA-class II transcripts in leukemias.;In addition to their role in the immune response, MHC class II antigens may be considered as differentiation markers on hemopoietic cells. To study expression of class II genes at the mRNA level in leukemias representing various stages of lymphoid and myeloid differentiation, we constructed chain- and locus-specific HLA class II DNA probes. As the genes encoding the DR, DQ, and DP beta-chains display a strong sequence homology in the second extracellular and transmembrane domains, we used probes derived from the less conserved 3' untranslated regions. For the more divergent alpha-chain genes, DNA fragments derived from the coding portion were obtained from cDNA clones. All probes were designed to minimize background due to AT- or GC-rich segments and subcloned into pUC plasmids. Their lack of cross-hybridization was demonstrated in Southern blot experiments under moderately stringent conditions. Northern blot analysis of RNA from 15 patients with acute lymphoblastic and myeloblastic leukemias, chronic lymphoid and hairy cell leukemias showed that most patients expressed variable amounts of class II transcripts, some lacked all class II mRNA, and only two patients had a dissociated expression of class II genes, with lack of DQ and presence of DR and DP mRNA. This study reveals a vast heterogeneity of MHC class II gene expression in leukemias, as previously demonstrated at the protein level. The availability of these highly specific DNA probes should prove useful in extensive studies directed at better defining HLA class II gene expression during hemopoietic differentiation in physiologic and pathologic states.;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

The fistula was between the left carotid artery and the brachiocephalic vein. The patient had significant left-to-right shunt and was highly symptomatic. Due to the large orifice and pseudoaneurysmatic enlargement of the fistula, we had to use a large Amplatzer PDA occluder and the protruding part of the PDA device disk had to be covered with a carotid stent.

The MBP-BF2-(G4S)3-beta(2)m fusion protein was expressed and purified in a pMAL-p2X/E. coli TB1 system. The purified MBP-BF2-(G4S)3-beta(2)m protein was cleaved by Factor Xa protease, and further purified by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography. The conformation of the BF2-(G4S)3-beta(2)m protein was determined by circular dichroism (CD). In addition, the refolded BF2-(G4S)3-beta2m protein was used to bind three predicted nonameric peptides derived from the hemagglutinins of the avian influenza virus (AIV) H5N1 and H9N2 subtypes. The BF2-(G4S)3-beta2m-associated peptides were detected by mass spectrometry. The molecular weights and amino acid sequences of the peptides were confirmed by primary and tandem mass spectrometry analysis, respectively. The results indicate that the secondary structures and predicted three-dimensional crystal structure of BF2-(G4S)3-beta(2)m are similar to those of the monomers of chicken BF2 and beta(2)m. The BF2-(G4S)3-beta(2)m protein could bind two of the three predicted nonamer peptides derived from AIV hemagglutinin. The experimental system demonstrated that the reconstructed BF2-(G4S)3-beta(2)m protein complex can be used to identify nonamer peptides, including T-cell epitopes in chicken. ;polyglycine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

Hirudin-thrombin complex, preadsorbed thrombin bound with hirudin, and thrombin were coated onto the surfaces of glass beads. The activity of the thrombin component adsorbed onto the surface, and hence the ability of hirudin to bind and inactivate thrombin, was determined by measuring the activity of thrombin to cleave fibrinogen to generate fibrin and to cleave a chromogenic substrate, S-2238.

5624;8246978;CTCF, a conserved nuclear factor required for optimal transcriptional activity of the chicken c-myc gene, is an 11-Zn-finger protein differentially expressed in multiple forms.;A novel sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, CTCF, which interacts with the chicken c-myc gene promoter, has been identified and partially characterized (V. V. Lobanenkov, R. H. Nicolas, V. V. Adler, H. Paterson, E. M. Klenova, A. V. Polotskaja, and G. H. Goodwin, Oncogene 5:1743-1753, 1990). In order to test directly whether binding of CTCF to one specific DNA region of the c-myc promoter is important for chicken c-myc transcription, we have determined which nucleotides within this GC-rich region are responsible for recognition of overlapping sites by CTCF and Sp1-like proteins. Using missing-contact analysis of all four nucleotides in both DNA strands and homogeneous CTCF protein purified by sequence-specific chromatography, we have identified three sets of nucleotides which contact either CTCF or two Sp1-like proteins binding within the same DNA region. Specific mutations of 3 of 15 purines required for CTCF binding were designed to eliminate binding of CTCF without altering the binding of other proteins. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay of nuclear extracts showed that the mutant DNA sequence did not bind CTCF but did bind two Sp1-like proteins. When introduced into a 3.3-kbp-long 5'-flanking noncoding c-myc sequence fused to a reporter CAT gene, the same mutation of the CTCF binding site resulted in 10- and 3-fold reductions, respectively, of transcription in two different (erythroid and myeloid) stably transfected chicken cell lines. Isolation and analysis of the CTCF cDNA encoding an 82-kDa form of CTCF protein shows that DNA-binding domain of CTCF is composed of 11 Zn fingers: 10 are of C2H2 class, and 1 is of C2HC class. CTCF was found to be abundant and conserved in cells of vertebrate species. We detected six major nuclear forms of CTCF protein differentially expressed in different chicken cell lines and tissues. We conclude that isoforms of 11-Zn-finger factor CTCF which are present in chicken hematopoietic HD3 and BM2 cells can act as a positive regulator of the chicken c-myc gene transcription. Possible functions of other CTCF forms are discussed. ;polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of DegU are required for activation of aprE and comK, respectively. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the helix-turn-helix region of DegU and in vivo examination of 27 DegU variants revealed five common mutants that showed severe reduction of gene expression of both aprE and comK because of reduced DNA-binding activity. This observation suggested that the DegU-recognized cis-sequences might not be considerably changed for either promoter. We identified a DegU-recognized inverted repeat in the comK promoter using various mutant comK-lacZ fusions. Inspection of the aprE promoter sequence revealed a tandem repeat consisting of short AT-rich sequences containing a consensus one, 5'-TAAAT-3', which was found in the downstream half of the inverted repeat involved in comK activation. Oligonucleotide-directed replacement of the short AT-rich sequences located in the center of each motif decreased DegU-dependent aprE expression, implying that the repeat is required for the activation of aprE. Based on these results, it was concluded that DegU would function through the inverted repeat in the comK promoter and the tandem repeat in the aprE promoter. ;polythreonine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
5632;9011744;Gene structure and chromosomal localization of the mouse NMDA receptor channel subunits.;Multiple espilon subunits are major determinants of the diversity of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor channel. The four epsilon subunit mRNAs exhibit distinct expression patterns in the brain. In an attempt to elucidate the molecular basis of selective and characteristic expression of the NMDA receptor channel subunits, we have isolated the gene encoding the mouse NMDA receptor epsilon 3 subunit and have determined its structural organization. The epsilon 3 subunit gene spans 17.5 kb and consists of 14 exons. The major transcription start site is 439 bp upstream of the ATG initiation codon as determined by primer extension and S1 nucleas protection analyses. Two polyadenylation sites are 397 (or 398) and 402 bp downstream of the termination codon. The 5'-flanking region of the epsilon 3 subunit gene contains GC-rich segments including consensus sequences for binding of the transcription factors Spl and EGR-1. The murine chromosomal locations of the five NMDA receptor channel subunits, the epsilon 1 (Grin2a), epsilon 2 (Grin2b), epsilon 3 (Grin2c), epsilon 4 (Grin2d) and zeta 1 (Grinl) subunits, were determined using an interspecific backcross mapping panel derived from crosses of [(C57BL/6JxM. spretus) F1xC57BL/6J] mice.

5633;8772456;Shortening heat in slow- and fast-twitch muscles of the rat.;Shortening heat has been reported in several amphibian skeletal muscles. In this investigation, shortening heat has been investigated in both soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles of young rats. The procedure involved shortening the muscles through two different distances, at near maximum velocity and at the onset of a summated twitch from different initial lengths. At the end of the shortening period, the muscle contracted isometrically, and the stress and associated heat production were recorded. These heat-stress data were compared with heat-stress data of isometric twitches at different initial lengths. There was a parallel upward shift in energy output when shortening occurred, indicating the presence of a shortening heat. Shortening heat increased with the distance shortened in soleus, but this was not the case for EDL. The values for the shortening heat coefficient for both muscle types are slightly higher than those reported for amphibian skeletal muscle and suggest that shortening heat is a significant component of the energy output of mammalian skeletal muscle.;-;-;-;hard_0
5635;19124461;Zinc finger transcription factor INSM1 interrupts cyclin D1 and CDK4 binding and induces cell cycle arrest.;INSM1 is a zinc finger transcription factor that plays an important role in pancreatic beta-cell development. To further evaluate its role in cell fate determination, we investigated INSM1 effects on cell cycle function. The cyclin box of cyclin D1 is essential for INSM1 binding. Competitive pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation revealed that INSM1 binding to cyclin D1 interrupts its association with CDK4 and induces hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein. An inducible Tet-on system was established in Cos-7 and Panc-1 cells. Using serum starvation, we synchronized the cell cycle and subsequently induced cell cycle progression by serum stimulation. Comparison of the INSM1 induction group with the noninduced control group, INSM1 ectopic expression causes cell cycle arrest, whereas the INSM1-mediated cell cycle arrest could be reversed by cyclin D1 and CDK4 overexpression. The proline-rich N-terminal portion of INSM1 is required for cyclin D1 binding. Mutation of proline residues abolished cyclin D1 binding and also diminished its ability to induce cell cycle arrest. Cellular proliferation of Panc-1 cells was inhibited by INSM1 overexpression demonstrated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, soft agar colony formation, as well as tumor growth in a nude mouse model. Taken together, we provide evidence to support that INSM1 binds to cyclin D1, interrupts cell cycle signaling, and inhibits cellular proliferation. ;polyproline;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
5636;22589250;A rat model for LGI1-related epilepsies.;Mutations of the leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) gene cause an autosomal dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features also known as autosomal-dominant lateral temporal lobe epilepsy. LGI1 is also the main antigen present in sera and cerebrospinal fluids of patients with limbic encephalitis and seizures, highlighting its importance in a spectrum of epileptic disorders. LGI1 encodes a neuronal secreted protein, whose brain function is still poorly understood. Here, we generated, by ENU (N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea) mutagenesis, Lgi1-mutant rats carrying a missense mutation (L385R). We found that the L385R mutation prevents the secretion of Lgi1 protein by COS7 transfected cells. However, the L385R-Lgi1 protein was found at low levels in the brains and cultured neurons of Lgi1-mutant rats, suggesting that mutant protein may be destabilized in vivo. Studies on the behavioral phenotype and intracranial electroencephalographic signals from Lgi1-mutant rats recalled several features of the human genetic disorder. We show that homozygous Lgi1-mutant rats (Lgi1(L385R/L385R)) generated early-onset spontaneous epileptic seizures from P10 and died prematurely. Heterozygous Lgi1-mutant rats (Lgi1(+/L385R)) were more susceptible to sound-induced, generalized tonic-clonic seizures than control rats. Audiogenic seizures were suppressed by antiepileptic drugs such as carbamazepine, phenytoin and levetiracetam, which are commonly used to treat partial seizures, but not by the prototypic absence seizure drug, ethosuximide. Our findings provide the first rat model with a missense mutation in Lgi1 gene, an original model complementary to knockout mice. This study revealed that LGI1 disease-causing missense mutations might cause a depletion of the protein in neurons, and not only a failure of Lgi1 secretion. ;polyleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

The addition of 0.01-1000 ng/ml biologically active ovine PRL for 2 h had no effect on the rate of secretion or the intracellular levels of PRL. The functional integrity of the cells was verified by the demonstration that estradiol (10(-8) M) caused a 3-fold increase in both PRL synthesis and secretion. Ergocryptine (10(-8) M) inhibited PRL secretion by 57% (P less than 0.001), and this response was modulated by pretreatment with estradiol. Increasing concentrations of endogenously secreted PRL did not detectably alter the rate of incorporation of [35S]methionine into cellular PRL in control or ergocryptine-treated cells for up to 8 h. These results indicate that autoregulation of PRL does not operate directly at the level of the pituitary.;-;-;-;hard_0

5645;21674007;SNPs occur in regions with less genomic sequence conservation.;"Rates of SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) and cross-species genomic sequence conservation reflect intra- and inter-species variation, respectively. Here, I report SNP rates and genomic sequence conservation adjacent to mRNA processing regions and show that, as expected, more SNPs occur in less conserved regions and that functional regions have fewer SNPs. Results are confirmed using both mouse and human data. Regions include protein start codons, 3' splice sites, 5' splice sites, protein stop codons, predicted miRNA binding sites, and polyadenylation sites. Throughout, SNP rates are lower and conservation is higher at regulatory sites. Within coding regions, SNP rates are highest and conservation is lowest at codon position three and the fewest SNPs are found at codon position two, reflecting codon degeneracy for amino acid encoding. Exon splice sites show high conservation and very low SNP rates, reflecting both splicing signals and protein coding. Relaxed constraint on the codon third position is dramatically seen when separating exonic SNP rates based on intron phase. At polyadenylation sites, a peak of conservation and low SNP rate occurs from 30 to 17 nt preceding the site. This region is highly enriched for the sequence AAUAAA, reflecting the location of the conserved polyA signal. miRNA 3' UTR target sites are predicted incorporating interspecies genomic sequence conservation; SNP rates are low in these sites, again showing fewer SNPs in conserved regions. Together, these results confirm that SNPs, reflecting recent genetic variation, occur more frequently in regions with less evolutionarily conservation.

To elucidate a mechanism of mRNA export, we identified a novel ptr [poly(A)+ RNA transport] mutation, ptr6, which causes accumulation of mRNA in the nucleus and inhibition of growth at the nonpermissive temperature. The ptr6(+) gene was found to encode an essential protein of 393 amino acids, which shares significant homology in amino acid sequence with yTAFII67 of budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human hTAFII55, a subunit of the general transcription factor complex TFIID. A Ptr6p-GFP fusion protein is localized in the nucleus, suggesting that Ptr6p functions there. Northern blot analysis using probes for 10 distinct mRNAs showed that the amount of tbp+ mRNA encoding the TATA-binding protein is increased five- to sixfold, whereas amounts of others are rapidly decreased at the nonpermissive temperature in ptr6-1. ptr6 has no defects in nuclear import of an NLS-GFP fusion protein. These results suggest that Ptr6p required for mRNA transport is a Schizosaccharomyces pombe homologue of yTAFII67 and hTAFII55. This is the first report suggesting that a TAF is involved in the nucleocytoplasmic transport of mRNA in addition to the transcription of the protein-coding genes. ;polyalanine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

To further characterize the mechanism by which TNF activates the A20 gene, we have cloned the A20 5'-flanking sequences and identified TNF-responsive elements within the promoter. The transcription initiation site was mapped by both primer extension and S1 nuclease protection experiments to a position 4.2 kilobases (kb) upstream of the initiator methionine; the first and second exon were separated by a 3.9-kb intron. Sequences upstream of the transcription start site were 76% GC-rich and contained six Sp1 binding sites and a TATA-like sequence at -29 but lacked a consensus CCAAT site. Transfection of Jurkat T-cells with an array of A20 promoter CAT constructs showed that two kappa B elements residing at -54 and -66 were required for induction by TNF. Supporting this notion, DNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays using nuclear extracts from unstimulated and TNF-stimulated Jurkat cells demonstrated kappa B-specific binding of a TNF-activated factor to an end-labeled probe containing the two A20 kappa B sequences. Finally, evidence obtained from cotransfection experiments showed that A20 negatively regulated its own expression.";polycysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
5652;8380985;The contribution of pyruvate cycling to loss of [6-3H]glucose during conversion of glucose to glycogen in hepatocytes: effects of insulin, glucose and acinar origin of hepatocytes.;1. During conversion of [6-3H,U-14C]glucose to glycogen in liver, loss of 6-3H can occur either by cycling via pyruvate (between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis) or by other mechanisms. We used mercaptopicolinate, an inhibitor of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, to determine the extent to which pyruvate cycling contributes to loss of 6-3H during glucose conversion to glycogen in hepatocytes. 2. Mercaptopicolinate increased the 3H/14C ratio in glycogen during incubation of rat, guinea pig, pig and human hepatocytes with [6-3H,U-14C]glucose. The increase in the 3H/14C ratio in glycogen caused by mercaptopicolinate was greater in periportal than in perivenous rat hepatocytes, indicating that cycling of glucose via pyruvate is more prominent in cells with a higher gluconeogenic relative to glycolytic capacity. 3. The effect of mercaptopicolinate on the 3H/14C ratio in glycogen was observed both in the absence and in the presence of insulin, indicating that stimulation of glycogen synthesis by insulin is not associated with inhibition of pyruvate cycling. In rat and guinea pig but not in pig hepatocytes, the effects of mercaptopicolinate on the 3H/14C ratio in glycogen were greater at 10-15 mM glucose than at 30 mM glucose, suggesting diminished cycling via pyruvate at high glucose concentrations. 4. Insulin increased the loss of 6-3H during stimulation of conversion of glucose to glycogen in hepatocytes from all species. This was due in part to an increase in pyruvate cycling and in part to other mechanisms that are not inhibited by mercaptopicolinate. 5. These results suggest that pyruvate cycling is a significant, but not exclusive, component of the loss of 6-3H in the hepatocyte during glucose conversion to glycogen. The extent of pyruvate cycling is dependent on the acinar origin of the hepatocytes and on the glucose concentration and presence of insulin.;-;-;-;hard_0
5654;8048820;Intrapulmonary shunting in the biliary atresia/polysplenia syndrome: reversal after liver transplantation.;"UNLABELLED
One hundred and seventy three children, including 93 with biliary atresia, received liver grafts at Addenbrooke's Hospital between 1983 and 1993. Of these, only seven developed cyanosis due to intrapulmonary shunting as a complication of their liver disease, and all seven of these had the biliary atresia/polysplenia syndrome. Intrapulmonary shunting was confirmed by a radioisotope scan in four children. Only one child with the syndrome did not have cyanosis when undergoing transplantation. Seven of the eight children are alive 6-54 months after transplantation, with normal pulmonary and hepatic function. Cyanosis recurred in one child who developed chronic rejection with liver failure.


IN CONCLUSION
(a) there is a strong association between the biliary atresia/polysplenia syndrome and cyanosis due to intrapulmonary shunting; (b) intrapulmonary shunting is fully reversible after successful liver transplantation; and (c) cyanosis, once present, is progressive, and these children should be considered for liver transplantation as soon as it occurs.";-;-;-;hard_0

5661;11854844;The Basic Amino Acid-Rich DNA-Binding Element of the NF-IL6 Transcription Factor Contains Two Functionally Distinct Subdomains.;"Nuclear factor-interleukin-6 (NF-IL6), a human transcription factor of the CCAAT-box/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) family, is widely implicated as a ""master regulator"" of hepatic acute-phrase response and inflammatory cytokine gene expression. NF-IL6 contains, at its N-terminus, an alanine- and proline-rich transactivation domain, followed at the C-terminus by a basic domain-leucine zipper (bZIP) DNA-binding motif. Understanding how the NF-IL6 transcription factor interacts with DNA is fundamental to its role as a transactivator because sequence-specific DNA-binding is prerequisite to promoter activation. We review our findings on the identification of the minimal ""core"" DNA-binding domain and the discovery of a novel bZIP element that influences DNA-binding kinetics. Manipulation of this domain allows for design of molecules that can be used as competitive antagonists or targeted delivery of molecules to selected regions of the eukaryotic genome.

5669;1624224;The unique interaction with immunity of FCE 24517, an antitumor drug with a novel mode of action.;The present study was designed to characterize in mice the effects on the immune system of the antineoplastic agent FCE 24517, a benzoic acid mustard derivative of distamycin A with specificity for AT-rich base pair sequences of beta-DNA. At antitumorally therapeutic doses, single injections of FCE 24517 caused profound leukopenia and a decrease of spleen cell numbers. However, primary and secondary antibody production to the T-dependent antigen sheep red blood cells were markedly increased by FCE 24517 given before or together with antigen. Antibody production to the T-independent antigen type III pneumococcal polysaccharide was not appreciably affected by FCE 24517. The delayed type hypersensitivity response to sheep erythrocytes was only marginally decreased, whereas proliferation of spleen cells to mitogens was markedly depressed. The ability of natural killer cells and macrophages to mediate cytotoxicity was not affected by FCE 24517 treatment. The ability of carrier-primed cells from drug-treated mice to cooperate for anti-trinitrophenyl antibody production increased twofold over that of vehicle-injected controls, suggesting an increase in T-helper cell activity. Serum cytokine levels were studied in mice injected with bacterial lipopolysaccharide used as a model stimulus. Peak levels of TNF and IL-6 were not modified by FCE 24517, but at later times higher amounts of cytokines were found in drug-treated mice compared with the control, suggesting a longer exposure of immunocompetent cells to these factors. Two compounds (FCE 24561 and CC-1065), also capable of binding AT-rich sequences in the minor groove of beta-DNA and containing an alkylating moiety, had immunomodulatory activity similar to FCE 24517 in increasing primary anti-sheep erythrocytes response. It is concluded that FCE 24517 exhibits a unique interaction with the immune system, markedly different from that of alkylating agents and may be representative of a novel group of antiproliferative-immunomodulating agents.;polythreonine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
5670;8160351;Immediate-early gene expression and gene mapping comparisons among isolates of bovine herpesvirus 1 and 5.;"Bovine herpesviruses (BHV) are associated with a variety of clinical syndromes. Bovine herpesvirus 1 isolates were placed into three genome subtypes based on restriction endonuclease analyses, which were loosely associated by clinical manifestation as BHV1.1 (respiratory), BHV1.2 (genital), and BHV1.3 (encephalitic). More recently the encephalitic isolate has been classified BHV5. A comparison of the cytopathic effect (CPE) in fetal bovine lung cell cultures in the presence of cycloheximide showed that BHV1.1 and 1.2 isolates produced elongated, spindle-shaped CPE, whereas BHV5 produced more syncytial-like CPE. Each BHV-1 subtype synthesized four immediate-early transcripts. The sizes in kb were: 1.6, 3.4, 5.8, 7.5 (BHV1.1); 1.8, 3.6, 5.8, 7.5 (BHV1.2); and 1.8, 3.6, 5.8, 8.6 (BHV5). These transcripts were mapped to the inverted repeat region of each isolate by Southern blot hybridization using cDNA prepared from cycloheximide-treated BHV1-infected cellular polyA RNA. A possible unique immediate-early RNA may be produced by the BHV5 encephalitic isolate from an area of the internal repeat region unique to this isolate. Hybridization analysis using BHV1.1 cloned probes of the immediate-early protein gene, thymidine kinase gene, DNA binding/DNA polymerase gene, and glycoprotein III gene provided information for mapping of these genes to the BHV5 encephalitic isolate.

5671;33711494;Early 17β-estradiol treatment reduces seizures but not abnormal behaviour in mice with expanded polyalanine tracts in the Aristaless related homeobox gene (ARX).;Children with severe intellectual disability have an increased prevalence of refractory seizures. Steroid treatment may improve seizure outcomes, but the mechanism remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that short term, daily delivery of an exogenous steroid 17β-estradiol (40 ng/g) in early postnatal life significantly reduced the number and severity of seizures, but did not improve behavioural deficits, in mice modelling mutations in the Aristaless-related homeobox gene (ARX), expanding the first (PA1) or second (PA2) polyalanine tract. Frequency of observed seizures on handling (n = 14/treatment/genotype) were significantly reduced in PA1 (32% reduction) and more modestly reduced in PA2 mice (14% reduction) with steroid treatment compared to vehicle. Spontaneous seizures were assessed (n = 7/treatment/genotype) at 7 weeks of age coinciding with a peak of seizure activity in untreated mice. PA1 mice treated with steroids no longer present with the most severe category of prolonged myoclonic seizures. Treated PA2 mice had an earlier onset of seizures coupled with a subsequent reduction in seizures later in postnatal life, with a complete absence of any seizures during the analysis at 7 weeks of age. Despite the reduction in seizures, 17β-estradiol treated mice showed no improvement in behavioural or cognitive outcomes in adulthood. For the first time we show that these deficits due to mutations in Arx are already present before seizure onset and do not worsen with seizures. ARX is a transcription factor and Arx PA mutant mice have deregulated transcriptome profiles in the developing embryonic brain. At postnatal day 10, treatment completion, RNAseq identified 129 genes significantly deregulated (Log2FC > ± 0.5, P-value<0.05) in the frontal cortex of mutant compared to wild-type mice. This list reflects genes deregulated in disease and was particularly enriched for known genes in neurodevelopmental disorders and those involved in signalling and developmental pathways. 17β-estradiol treatment of mutant mice significantly deregulated 295 genes, with only 23 deregulated genes overlapping between vehicle and steroid treated mutant mice. We conclude that 17β-estradiol treatment recruits processes and pathways to reduce the frequency and severity of seizures in the Arx PA mutant mice but does not precisely correct the deregulated transcriptome nor improve mortality or behavioural and cognitive deficits.;polyalanine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
5673;23029009;Solution structure of MSL2 CXC domain reveals an unusual Zn3Cys9 cluster and similarity to pre-SET domains of histone lysine methyltransferases.;The dosage compensation complex (DCC) binds to single X chromosomes in Drosophila males and increases the transcription level of X-linked genes by approximately twofold. Male-specific lethal 2 (MSL2) together with MSL1 mediates the initial recruitment of the DCC to high-affinity sites in the X chromosome. MSL2 contains a DNA-binding cysteine-rich CXC domain that is important for X targeting. In this study, we determined the solution structure of MSL2 CXC domain by NMR spectroscopy. We identified three zinc ions in the CXC domain and determined the metal-to-cysteine connectivities from (1)H-(113)Cd correlation experiments. The structure reveals an unusual zinc-cysteine cluster composed of three zinc ions coordinated by six terminal and three bridging cysteines. The CXC domain exhibits unexpected structural homology to pre-SET motifs of histone lysine methyltransferases, expanding the distribution and structural diversity of the CXC domain superfamily. Our findings provide novel structural insight into the evolution and function of CXC domains. ;polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
5676;8663059;Isolation and characterization of the 102-kilodalton RNA-binding protein that binds to the 5' and 3' translational enhancers of tobacco mosaic virus RNA.;Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus the genome of which acts as a mRNA in the cytoplasm. On infection, TMV mRNA is efficiently and selectively translated by the host translation machinery despite the lack of a poly(A) tail, which is normally required for efficient translation. Both the 68-base 5' leader (Omega) and the 205-base 3' untranslated region of TMV promote efficient translation. A 25-base poly(CAA) region within Omega and the upstream pseudoknot domain, a 72-base region composed of three RNA pseudoknots, are responsible for the translational regulation. We have identified, purified, and characterized a 102-kDa RNA-binding protein (p102) from wheat that binds specifically to the poly(CAA) region within Omega and the upstream pseudoknot domain within the TMV 3' untranslated region. Polyclonal antibodies raised against wheat p102 were used to demonstrate that p102 is widely conserved in plant species. Moreover, specific RNA binding activity was detected in all plant species tested. Addition of anti-p102 antibodies to an in vitro translation lysate derived from wheat germ repressed translation, which was subsequently reversed by supplementing the lysate with p102. These findings suggest that this protein may play an important role in determining translational efficiency in plants.; polyalanine ;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

5682;28655759;RBM25 is a global splicing factor promoting inclusion of alternatively spliced exons and is itself regulated by lysine mono-methylation.;In eukaryotes, precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing removes non-coding intron sequences to produce mature mRNA. This removal is controlled in part by RNA-binding proteins that regulate alternative splicing decisions through interactions with the splicing machinery. RNA binding motif protein 25 (RBM25) is a putative splicing factor strongly conserved across eukaryotic lineages. However, the role of RBM25 in global splicing regulation and its cellular functions are unknown. Here we show that RBM25 is required for the viability of multiple human cell lines, suggesting that it could play a key role in pre-mRNA splicing. Indeed, transcriptome-wide analysis of splicing events demonstrated that RBM25 regulates a large fraction of alternatively spliced exons throughout the human genome. Moreover, proteomic analysis indicated that RBM25 interacts with components of the early spliceosome and regulators of alternative splicing. Previously, we identified an RBM25 species that is mono-methylated at lysine 77 (RBM25K77me1), and here we used quantitative mass spectrometry to show that RBM25K77me1 is abundant in multiple human cell lines. We also identified a region of RBM25 spanning Lys-77 that binds with high affinity to serine- and arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2), a crucial protein in exon definition, but only when Lys-77 is unmethylated. Together, our findings uncover a pivotal role for RBM25 as an essential regulator of alternative splicing and reveal a new potential mechanism for regulation of pre-mRNA splicing by lysine methylation of a splicing factor. ;polyarginine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

5689;9003612;Clinical and molecular study of Corynebacterium diphtheriae systemic infections in France. Coryne Study Group.;Diphtheria is a disease with a long history that almost completely disappeared from developed countries. In addition, until 1987, systemic infections involving Corynebacterium diphtheriae were rare. However, in 1990, an epidemic occurred in Russia. These two circumstances have provided the stimulus to gain insight into the situation in France. In fact, between 1987 and 1993, a total of 59 C. diphtheriae strains were isolated. Epidemiological data were collected for patients from whom 40 strains were isolated from normally sterile sites, including 34 from blood cultures, and half of the bacteremic patients developed endocarditis. Osteoarticular involvement was noted in 11 of these 40 patients, including 5 bacteremic patients. The fatality rate following bacteremia was 36%, despite specific antibiotic treatment (beta-lactams and aminoglycosides). The mean age of the participants was 38 years, with half of the patients subsisting under low socioeconomic conditions and suffering from homelessness or alcoholism. Apparently, the skin turned out to be the major route of transmission in this reemerging disease. Eighty-eight percent of the isolates belonged to the C. diphtheriae biotype mitis. These were found predominantly in the Paris area, and most were of the same ribotype. Those isolates originating from the overseas territories (Guyana and New Caledonia) belonged to C. diphtheriae biotype gravis. No strains were positive for the tox gene by PCR. This study attests to the persistent circulation in France of C. diphtheriae in the form of systemic infections. The matter is especially significant since these strains are nontoxigenic and are of a unique ribotype. The strains are, however, sensitive to most antibiotics, although 20% are rifampin resistant.;-;-;-;hard_0

5691;12031496;Transcription of the mouse PAC1 receptor gene: cell-specific expression and regulation by Zac1.;Regulations of the PACAP type 1 (PAC1) receptor expression have been described in the brain and the anterior pituitary. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying mouse PAC1 gene regulation, we first mapped its transcription start sites (tss). PAC1 receptor RNA initiates from two major sites in embryos and adult tissues. Functional analysis revealed a basal promoter within the first 180 bp upstream of transcription start. Negative regulatory sequences upstream of this minimal promoter control the cell type-specific transcription of a luciferase reporter gene. Zac1, a zinc finger protein mainly expressed in the brain and the pituitary gland, binds to a GC-rich motif of the promoter regulatory elements. The Zac1 DNA binding site is required to positive and negative regulations of the promoter.

5699;17091338;Cloning and expression of a novel human gene, Isl-2, encoded a LIM-homeodomain protein.;The LIM-homeodomain (LIM-HD) proteins have a homeodomain and two N-terminal LIM domains, which consist of a conserved cysteine- and histidine-rich structure of two tandem repeated zinc fingers. LIM domain is involved in protein-protein interactions during transcriptional regulation. LIM-HD proteins are classically suggested as major transcriptional regulators which, in cooperation with other transcription factors, play critical roles in several developing systems and organs, such as nervous system, pancreas, and heart. Here we have cloned the full-length cDNA of human Isl-2 from a human embryo heart cDNA library. The gene contains six exons and spans 5.7 kb in chromosome 15q23 region, and transcribes a 1.9 kb mRNA that encodes a protein with 359 amino acid residues. The predicted protein, containing two tandem LIM motifs in N-terminal and a homeodomain domain, is well conserved, especially in the LIM and DNA-binding domains. Northern blot analysis shows that human Isl-2 is expressed in every human tissue examined at adult stage and during embryonic developmental stages from 34 days to 24 weeks at different levels in tissues. The broad expression of Isl-2 gene in tissues during embryogenesis and adult development suggests that it may be involved in both differentiation and maintenance of these tissues and might play an important role. ;polyhistidine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

The tauopathy model transgenic (Tg) THY-Tau22 (Tau22) mouse shows disturbed septo-hippocampal transmission, memory deficits and no signs of motor dysfunction. The reports showing a hippocampal downregulation of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in SAMP8 mice, a model of aging, and an upregulation of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in Tg-VLW mice, a model of FTDP17 tauopathy, may lead to think that the supply of ACh to the hippocampus can be threatened as aging or Tau pathology progress. The above was tested by comparing the mRNA levels for ACh-related enzymes in hippocampi of wild-type (wt) and Tau22 mice at ages when the neuropathological signs are debuting (3-4 months), moderate (6-7 months) and extensive (>9 months). Age-matched Tau22 and wt mice hippocampi displayed similar ChAT, AChE-T, butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and a proline-rich membrane anchor (PRiMA) mRNA levels, any change most likely arising from ACh homeostasis. The unchanged hippocampal levels of AChE-T mRNA and enzyme activity observed in Tau22 mice, expressing G272V-P301S hTau, differed from the increase in AChE-T mRNA and activity observed in Tg-VLW mice, expressing G272V-P301L-R406W hTau. The difference supports the idea that AChE upregulation may proceed or not depending on the particular Tau mutation, which would dictate Tau folding, the accessibility/affinity to kinases and phosphatases, and P-Tau aggregation with itself and protein partners, transcription factors included. ;polyproline;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

We determined urine and serum concentrations of tumour necrosis factor soluble receptors I and II (sTNFR I and sTNFR II) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) in 41 women with acute pyelonephritis caused by Escherichia coli, 2 weeks after the infection, during a subsequent episode of cystitis or asymptomatic bacteriuria and also later when the same patients were free from bacteriuria. Concentrations of sTNFR I, sTNFR II and IL-1ra were related to the expression of five virulence markers of E. coli, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and to the concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP) in serum. Patients with acute pyelonephritis had elevated serum concentrations of sTNFR I and sTNFR II compared to healthy women (P < 0.001 for both comparisons). The concentrations of sTNFR I and sTNFR II in urine were significantly higher in patients with acute pyelonephritis compared to controls (P < 0.001 in both cases). The concentration of sTNFR II in urine was higher in patients infected by E. coli producing haemolysin (P = 0.05) and in patients infected by E. coli expressing hydrophobic properties (P = 0.05) compared to patients infected by strains without these virulence traits. Patients who had high concentrations of sTNFR II in serum during acute pyelonephritis had lower GFR at follow-up (r = -0.48, P = 0.05). Patients who responded with a marked increase in CRP had higher sTNFR I and sTNFR II in urine (r = 0.58, P < 0.01 and r = 0.48, P < 0.01, respectively). The concentrations of sTNFR I and sTNFR II in serum and urine decreased during follow-up and were lower 2 weeks after the infection when all patients were free from bacteriuria. IL-1ra in serum was elevated during pyelonephritis (P < 0.001) while that in urine was significantly lower compared to controls (P < 0.001).

Toxicity requires normal uptake of peptides. When peptide transport was impaired by mutations, strains became resistant to the respective LCP. Inhibition of growth occurred immediately after the addition of LCP, and was relieved when 0.4 mM isoleucine was added. The presence of Gly-Leu in the medium correlated with the inhibition of growth, and the bacteria began to grow at the normal rate 70 min after Gly-Leu became undetectable. Disappearance of the peptide corresponded with the appearance of free leucine and glycine in the medium. The concentration of leucine inside the LCP-treated bacteria was higher than that in the leucine-treated and the control cultures. We suggest that entry of LCP into the cells via peptide transport systems circumvents the regulation of leucine transport, thereby causing abnormality high concentrations of leucine inside the cells. This accumulation of leucine interferes with the biosynthesis of isoleucine and inhibits the growth of the bacteria.;-;-;-;hard_0

The purpose of this study was to further the understanding of turnout by identifying the relationship between available hip external rotation an functional turnout for the five classical ballet positions.

Functional turnout angle was measured for each subject as the subject stood in each of the five classical ballet positions. A repeated measures analysis of variance and Tukey Honestly Significant Difference test indicated that hip external rotation was significantly less than functional turnout for the five classical ballet positions. No significant differences in functional turnout angle were present among the five ballet functional turnout angle for each of the five ballet positions.

5728;31917956;lncRNA Sensing of a Viral Suppressor of RNAi Activates Non-canonical Innate Immune Signaling in Drosophila.;Antiviral immunity in insects is mediated by the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. Viruses evade antiviral RNAi by expressing virulence factors known as viral suppressors of RNAi (VSR). Here, we report the identification of VINR, a Drosophila VSR-interacting long non-coding (lnc) RNA that activates non-canonical innate immune signaling upon detection of the dsRNA-binding VSR of Drosophila C virus (DCV). VINR is required for the induction of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes but dispensable for antiviral RNAi. VINR functions by preventing the ubiquitin proteasome-dependent degradation of Cactin, a coiled-coil and arginine-serine-rich domain-containing protein that regulates a non-cannonical antimicrobial pathway for AMP induction. CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of VINR in Drosophila cells enhances DCV replication independently of antiviral RNAi, and VINR-knockout adult flies exhibit enhanced disease susceptibility to DCV and bacteria. Our findings reveal a counter counter-defense strategy activated by a lncRNA in response to the viral suppression of the primary antiviral RNAi immunity.;polyserine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
5733;7845666;Products of alternatively spliced transcripts of the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene, wt1, have altered DNA binding specificity and regulate transcription in different ways.;"The Wilms' tumor susceptibility gene, wt1, encodes a transcription factor of the zinc finger protein family. Mutations in the WT1 gene product have been detected in both sporadic and familial Wilms' tumors, suggesting that alterations in WT1 may disrupt its normal function as a transcriptional regulator. The transcripts of wt1 are alternatively spliced; however, roles of the alternatively spliced forms have not been defined. The major transcript of wt1 encodes a WT1 protein [WT1(+KTS)+17AA] that contains three amino acids (+KTS) between the third and fourth zinc fingers and a serine-rich, 17 amino acid (+17AA) domain N-terminal to the zinc finger region. We now show that the WT1 (+KTS) forms functionally bind to a unique G+C-rich sequence within the PDGF A-chain promoter. We also show that WT1 (+KTS)+17AA functions as a strong transcriptional repressor and that +17AA alone fused to the zinc-finger domain of WT1 or to the heterologous DNA binding domain of GAL4 functions independently as a repressor. Deletion of four serine residues within +17AA abolishes the repressor activity of +17AA. These results indicate that wt1 products with +17AA contain an additional dominant repressor domain and that the presence or absence of +KTS determines alternative DNA binding specificity.";polycysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
5737;8985122;Structure and the promoter region of the mouse gene encoding the 67-kD form of glutamic acid decarboxylase.;We have cloned and determined the complete structure of the murine gene encoding the 67-kD form of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67), the gamma-aminobutyric acid synthetic enzyme. Its coding region comprises 18 exons spanning 42 kb of genomic DNA. Exon 1 together with 64 bp of exon 2 defines the 5' untranslated region of GAD67 mRNA. Exon 18 specifies the protein's carboxyl terminal and the entire 3' untranslated region. Exons 7/A and 7/B are solely contained in the coding regions of two alternatively spliced bicistronic embryonic mRNAs, which code for the truncated embryonic GAD forms. The promoter region (P1) corresponding to the main group of transcription initiation sites is devoid of TATA and CAAT boxes but has putative binding sites for the transcription factor SP1 and is embedded in a large G + C-rich domain of a CpG island, features shared by the promoters of constitutively expressed housekeeping genes. Primer extension data suggests the existence of additional transcription start sites at 130 bp and 295 bp upstream from the major initiation site that are utilized less frequently in adult brain. The tentative distal promoters (P2 and P3) that correspond to the minor start sites resemble tissue-specific promoters with TATA and CAAT-like boxes. In 1.3 kb of the 5'-upstream region, we identified several putative transcription factor binding sites such as AP2, Hox, E-box, egr-1, and NF-kappaB and putative neuronal-specific regulatory elements, including the neuronal-restrictive silencer element, which may have functional significance in the developmental and tissue-specific expression of the GAD67 gene. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

Even under unfavourable hygienic conditions of delivery and during the breast-feeding period Bifidobacteria develop and colonize the intestinal tract at high concentrations. In the present study we investigated the interaction between Bifidobacterium longum and a pathogenic E. coli strain in the germ-free rat. Sequential counts of the two bacterial strains allowed their proliferation to be followed. Electron microscopic as well as light microscopic examinations of selected intestinal mucosa segments revealed minor morphological changes. Bifidobacterium completely protected the rats against mortality from a consecutive infection with E. coli. Repeated inoculation of Bifidobacteria even decreased and kept down the initial E. coli population. Thus it appears that the germ-free rat is an appropriate model to study the development and interaction of both bacterial species and that the sequence of inoculation is most important.;-;-;-;hard_0

The method was later modified to amplification with only the outer pair of primers and a ""hot-start"" to eliminate amplification of non-target sequences. The modified method was as sensitive as ""nested"" PCR. However, with samples containing low levels of RNA, it is necessary to perform repeat amplifications to avoid false-negative results.

5750;2209551;Photoregulated gene expression may involve ubiquitous DNA binding proteins.;Several promoter elements have previously been shown to influence the expression of the cab-E gene in Nicotiana plumbaginifolia. Here we demonstrate, by electrophoretic mobility shift and methylation interference assays, that a complex pattern of protein-DNA interactions characterizes this promoter. Among the multiple proteins identified, we focused on five different factors which either occupied important regulatory elements and/or were present in relatively large amounts in nuclear extracts. All of these proteins were distinguished on the basis of their recognition sequence and other biochemical parameters. One, GBF, interacted with a single sequence within the cab-E promoter homologous to the G-box found in many photoregulated and other plant promoters. A second factor, GA-1, bound to the GATA element which is located between the CAAT and TATA boxes of the cab-E and all other LHCII Type I CAB promoters. GA-1 also interacted in vitro with the I-boxes of the Arabidopsis rbcS-1A promoter and the as-2 site of the CaMV 35S promoter. Two other factors, GC-1 and AT-1, bound to multiple recognition sites localized within the GC-rich and AT-rich elements, respectively.

5752;7192728;Protein intake regulation and nitrogen retention in young obese and lean mice.;Young female obese (ob/ob) and lean mice were fed a single diet containing 10 or 20% casein or were allowed to self-select from two diets containing 10 and 50, 20 and 60, or 30 and 70% casein for 3 weeks. Obese and lean mice offered a choice of two diets varying in protein-consumed 36% and 32%, respectively, of energy from protein. Although both obese and lean mice consumed more protein when allowed to self-select, each group maintained the same energy intake as observed when a single diet was fed. Because obese mice consumed more energy than lean mice, their self-selected intake of protein was 55% greater than observed in lean mice. The increased protein intake in self-selected obese mice was associated with a decreased tryptophan:large neutral amino acid ratio in their plasma. Average nitrogen retention was only slightly less in obese mice than in lean mice, but the sites of nitrogen deposition differed considerably. Obese mice retained only 35% of their nitrogen in the carcass (skeletal muscle and skeleton) while lean mice retained 58% of their nitrogen in the carcass. In summary, young obese mice allowed to self-select from two diets varying in protein and carbohydrate consumed more protein and more energy, but deposited less nitrogen in their carcasses, than lean mice. Hyperphagia in young obese mice is not directly linked to an increased demand for dietary protein.;-;-;-;hard_0
5756;9292011;Biochemical and functional interaction of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat transactivator with the general transcription factor TFIIB.;Tat strongly stimulates transcription of the human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) provirus by interacting with various cellular transcription factors, including TFIID. The results presented in this report indicate that the effect exerted by Tat also involves an interaction with TFIIB. A direct protein-protein interaction between Tat and TFIIB was observed in vitro. Detailed analysis of this interaction showed that the cysteine-rich and core domains of Tat bind to the N-terminal moiety of the general transcription factor. The role of the interaction between Tat and TFIIB in the activation of the entire HIV-1 promoter was analysed. Transfection experiments performed using a reporter construct containing the HIV-1 long terminal repeat fused to a reporter gene showed that overexpression of TFIIB progressively suppressed Tat-induced transcription. This effect was weakened by an increase in the intracellular concentration of Tat. A similar consequence of TFIIB overexpression was observed in a HeLa cell line stably transformed with a construct corresponding to the lacZ gene under the control of the HIV-1 promoter. Mutants of TFIIB which differed in their ability to interact with Tat and to function in basal transcription were analysed. The ability of TFIIB mutants defective for basal transcription to inhibit Tat-induced activity of the HIV-1 promoter depended on their capacity to interact with Tat. Mutants of TFIIB functional for basal transcription, but defective for the interaction with Tat, exhibited a dominant negative effect. From these data we propose a model in which interaction between Tat and both general transcription factors TBP and TFIIB maintains the transcriptional initiation complex in an active configuration. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
5763;24147646;Synthesis and characterization of recombinant abductin-based proteins.;Recombinant proteins are promising tools for tissue engineering and drug delivery applications. Protein-based biomaterials have several advantages over natural and synthetic polymers, including precise control over amino acid composition and molecular weight, modular swapping of functional domains, and tunable mechanical and physical properties. In this work, we describe recombinant proteins based on abductin, an elastomeric protein that is found in the inner hinge of bivalves and functions as a coil spring to keep shells open. We illustrate, for the first time, the design, cloning, expression, and purification of a recombinant protein based on consensus abductin sequences derived from Argopecten irradians . The molecular weight of the protein was confirmed by mass spectrometry, and the protein was 94% pure. Circular dichroism studies showed that the dominant structures of abductin-based proteins were polyproline II helix structures in aqueous solution and type II β-turns in trifluoroethanol. Dynamic light scattering studies illustrated that the abductin-based proteins exhibit reversible upper critical solution temperature behavior and irreversible aggregation behavior at high temperatures. A LIVE/DEAD assay revealed that human umbilical vein endothelial cells had a viability of 98 ± 4% after being cultured for two days on the abductin-based protein. Initial cell spreading on the abductin-based protein was similar to that on bovine serum albumin. These studies thus demonstrate the potential of abductin-based proteins in tissue engineering and drug delivery applications due to the cytocompatibility and its response to temperature. ;polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function
5767;9627157;HFE mutations in patients with hereditary haemochromatosis in Sweden.;"OBJECTIVE
To determine the frequency of mutations (C282Y and H63D) in a newly identified gene HFE in patients with hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) in Sweden.


DESIGN
Molecular genetic analyses of the HFE gene (polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by enzyme restriction) were performed in genomic DNA from unrelated patients with a clinical diagnosis of HH and in healthy subjects.


SETTINGS
Patients with HH treated with phlebotomies at Karolinska Hospital and Huddinge Hospital were analyzed.


SUBJECTS
Eighty-seven unrelated patients with HH and 117 healthy controls.


RESULTS
It was found that the HFE C282Y mutation occurs in 94.2% of chromosomes from patients with HH. Eighty patients (92.0%) were homozygous for the C282Y mutation and one was heterozygous. Three patients were heterozygous for both C282Y and H63D mutations. One patient was homozygous and one was heterozygous for the H63D mutation. One patient carried normal alleles. In healthy controls, the C282Y mutation occurred in nine subjects (7.7%), all of which were heterozygous. The H63D mutation was found in 28 control subjects, one of which was homozygous.


CONCLUSIONS
We found that the majority of patients with HH have the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. The frequency of the H63D mutation was higher in controls than in patients with HH, although in chromosomes at risk the frequency of the H63D mutation was higher in patients.";-;-;-;hard_0
5770;11258915;The antibacterial peptide pyrrhocoricin inhibits the ATPase actions of DnaK and prevents chaperone-assisted protein folding.;Recently, we documented that the short, proline-rich antibacterial peptides pyrrhocoricin, drosocin, and apidaecin interact with the bacterial heat shock protein DnaK, and peptide binding to DnaK can be correlated with antimicrobial activity. In the current report we studied the mechanism of action of these peptides and their binding sites to Escherichia coli DnaK. Biologically active pyrrhocoricin made of L-amino acids diminished the ATPase activity of recombinant DnaK. The inactive D-pyrrhocoricin analogue and the membrane-active antibacterial peptide cecropin A or magainin 2 failed to inhibit the DnaK-mediated phosphate release from adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP). The effect of pyrrhocoricin on DnaK's other significant biological function, the refolding of misfolded proteins, was studied by assaying the alkaline phosphatase and beta-galactosidase activity of live bacteria. Remarkably, both enzyme activities were reduced upon incubation with L-pyrrhocoricin or drosocin. D-Pyrrhocoricin, magainin 2, or buforin II, an antimicrobial peptide involved in binding to bacterial nucleic acids, had only negligible effect. According to fluorescence polarization and dot blot analysis of synthetic DnaK fragments and labeled pyrrhocoricin analogues, pyrrhocoricin bound with a K(d) of 50.8 microM to the hinge region around the C-terminal helices D and E, at the vicinity of amino acids 583 and 615. Pyrrhocoricin binding was not observed to the homologous DnaK fragment of Staphylococcus aureus, a pyrrhocoricin nonresponsive strain. In line with the lack of ATPase inhibition, drosocin binding appears to be slightly shifted toward the D helix. Our data suggest that drosocin and pyrrhocoricin binding prevents the frequent opening and closing of the multihelical lid over the peptide-binding pocket of DnaK, permanently closes the cavity, and inhibits chaperone-assisted protein folding. The biochemical results were strongly supported by molecular modeling of DnaK-pyrrhocoricin interactions. Due to the prominent sequence variations of procaryotic and eucaryotic DnaK molecules in the multihelical lid region, our findings pave the road for the design of strain-specific antibacterial peptides and peptidomimetics. Far-fetched applications of the species-specific inhibition of chaperone-assisted protein folding include the control of not only bacteria but also fungi, parasites, insects, and perhaps rodents. ;polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function
5771;33995430;Developmental Analysis of the GATA Factor HANABA TARANU Mutants in Medicago truncatula Reveals Their Roles in Nodule Formation.;Formation of nodules on legume roots results from symbiosis with rhizobial bacteria. Here, we identified two GATA transcription factors, MtHAN1 and MtHAN2, in Medicago truncatula, which are the homologs of HANABA TARANU (HAN) and HANABA TARANU LIKE in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our analysis revealed that MtHAN1 and MtHAN2 are expressed in roots and shoots including the root tip and nodule apex. We further show that MtHAN1 and MtHAN2 localize to the nucleus where they interact and that single and double loss-of-function mutants of MtHAN1 and MtHAN2 did not show any obvious phenotype in flower development, suggesting their role is different than their closest Arabidopsis homologues. Investigation of their symbiotic phenotypes revealed that the mthan1 mthan2 double mutant develop twice as many nodules as wild type, revealing a novel biological role for GATA transcription factors. We found that HAN1/2 transcript levels respond to nitrate treatment like their Arabidopsis counterparts. Global gene transcriptional analysis by RNA sequencing revealed different expression genes enriched for several pathways important for nodule development including flavonoid biosynthesis and phytohormones. In addition, further studies suggest that MtHAN1 and MtHAN2 are required for the expression of several nodule-specific cysteine-rich genes, which they may activate directly, and many peptidase and peptidase inhibitor genes. This work expands our knowledge of the functions of MtHANs in plants by revealing an unexpected role in legume nodulation.;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

Using multiparameter flow cytometric analyses, we demonstrate that each of these autoantibodies also react with human and mouse lymphocytes at physiologic temperatures. The anti-Pr2 autoantibody recognizes a glycoprotein determinant(s) expressed by a subset of both T and B lymphocytes. In contrast, the binding of anti-i and anti-I antibodies each is restricted to B-lymphocytes. The anti-i autoantibody binds to over 50% of all B cells, whereas the anti-I antibody reacts with less than 10% of either tonsillar or blood B cells. Prior studies identified that the B cell isoform of CD45 (B220) has the linear poly-N-acetyllactosamine that forms the ""i"" determinant. Because anti-B220 antibodies recently have been reported to influence T-dependent B-cell isotype switching, we tested each antibody for its ability to influence the production of secondary Ig isotypes by murine splenocytes co-cultured with a stimulator helper T cell clone. We find that addition of anti-i antibody increases the proportion of B cells secreting secondary Ig isotypes. In contrast, the anti-I antibody had no such effect. These findings imply that stimulation of B cells through the highly conserved carbohydrate determinant that forms the ""i"" antigen may be of physiologic importance in T-dependent B-cell differentiation.";polyasparagine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

Rodent serosurveys and analysis of precipitation records were also conducted. Twenty-three of 24 available probable cases were SNV antibody-positive, 17 of whom were ill between July 1995 and January 1996. Four (14.8%) of 27 case-contacts and 44 (12.8%) of 345 community residents were also seropositive. Calomys laucha (vesper mouse) was the most common rodent species captured and the most frequently SNV-seropositive. Rainfall in May 1995 was 10-fold greater than that seen in May over the preceding 11 years. This 17 case-cluster represents the largest documented outbreak since HPS was first recognized in 1993.

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine its role in vascular wall remodeling following injury. Approach and Results- Thrombin induced IL-33 expression in a time-dependent manner in human aortic smooth muscle cells and inhibition of its activity by its neutralizing antibody suppressed thrombin induced human aortic smooth muscle cell migration but not DNA synthesis. In exploring the mechanisms, we found that Par1 (protease-activated receptor 1), Gαq/11 (Gα protein q/11), PLCβ3 (phospholipase Cβ3), NFATc1 (nuclear factor of activated T cells), E2F1 (E2F transcription factor 1), and LMCD1 (LIM and cysteine-rich domains protein 1) are involved in thrombin-induced IL-33 expression and migration. Furthermore, we identified an NFAT-binding site at -100 nt that mediates thrombin-induced IL-33 promoter activity. Interestingly, we observed that NFATc1, E2F1, and LMCD1 bind to NFAT site in response to thrombin and found that LMCD1, while alone has no significant effect, enhanced either NFATc1 or E2F1-dependent IL-33 promoter activity. In addition, we found that guidewire injury induces IL-33 expression in SMC and its neutralizing antibodies substantially reduce SMC migration and neointimal growth in vivo. Increased expression of IL-33 was also observed in human atherosclerotic lesions as compared to arteries without any lesions. Conclusions- The above findings reveal for the first time that thrombin-induced human aortic smooth muscle cell migration and injury-induced neointimal growth require IL-33 expression. In addition, thrombin-induced IL-33 expression requires LMCD1 enhanced combinatorial activation of NFATc1 and E2F1. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

Scanning electron microscopy clearly showed the differences in distribution of cell types in the nasal mucosa. The ciliated cells increase in number from the anterior to the posterior areas of the respiratory epithelium with a corresponding decrease in nonciliated cells. However, even at a single cross-sectional area of the nasal cavity, the various surfaces have different proportions of ciliated versus nonciliated cells, e.g., the medial surface of the nasal concha has more ciliated cells than other surfaces. Brush cells are distributed between nonciliated cells of the respiratory epithelium on most surfaces of the nasal cavity including the conchae and the lateral wall.

5793;11596078;Sequence analysis of hepatitis B virus genomes from an infant with acute severe hepatitis and a hepatitis B e antigen-positive carrier mother.;It is well known that fulminant hepatitis B can occur in infants born to hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative hepatitis B virus (HBV) carrier mothers, whereas fulminant hepatitis and severe hepatitis are uncommon in infants born to HBeAg-positive mothers. We have encountered an infant with severe acute hepatitis B born to a HBeAg-positive mother. The aim of this study was to determine whether HBV variants contribute to the pathogenesis of fulminant hepatitis and severe hepatitis in an infant born to an HBeAg-positive mother. The nucleotide sequence of HBV genomes from the infant and his HBeAg-positive carrier mother was analyzed. All HBV isolated from the infant and his mother were subtype adr. The sequences of the cloned HBV genomes, each including a part of the X and precore/core regions, isolated from the infant were almost identical (homology of 99.1-99.9%) to those from his mother. There was no mutation in any of the 17 clones examined at nucleotides 1762 and 1764 in the core promoter, which is reported to be associated with fulminant hepatitis. A point mutation at nucleotide 1758 in the second AT-rich region of the basic core promoter was present in all clones. None of the clones had a point mutation at nucleotide 1896 of the precore region. In this study, no specific HBV variants contributing to the development of neonatal severe hepatitis were found. There is a possibility that host factors rather than viral factors play an important role in some cases of severe neonatal hepatitis B. ;polythreonine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

5804;18629681;Rat liver mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I, hepatic carnitine, and malonyl-CoA: effect of starvation.;"Hepatic mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis increase during starvation. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-I) catalyses the rate-controlling step in the overall pathway and retains its control over beta-oxidation under fed, starved and diabetic conditions. To determine the factors contributing to the reported several-fold increase in fatty acid oxidation in perfused livers, we measured the V(max) and K(m) values for palmitoyl-CoA and carnitine, the K(i) (and IC(50)) values for malonyl-CoA in isolated liver mitochondria as well as the hepatic malonyl-CoA and carnitine contents in control and 48 h starved rats. Since CPT-I is localized in the mitochondrial outer membrane and in contact sites, the kinetic properties of CPT-I also was determined in these submitochondrial structures. After 48 h starvation, there is: (a) a significant increase in K(i) and decrease in hepatic malonyl-CoA content; (b) a decreased K(m) for palmitoyl-CoA; and (c) increased catalytic activity (V(max)) and CPT-I protein abundance that is significantly greater in contact sites compared with outer membranes. Based on these changes the estimated increase in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation is significantly less than that observed in perfused liver. This suggests that CPT-I is regulated in vivo by additional mechanism(s) lost during mitochondrial isolation or/and that mitochondrial oxidation of peroxisomal beta-oxidation products contribute to the increased ketogenesis by bypassing CPT-I. Furthermore, the greater increase in CPT-I protein in contact sites as compared to outer membranes emphasizes the significance of contact sites in hepatic fatty acid oxidation.";-;-;-;hard_0
5812;2478059;Dexamethasone does not inhibit the release of mediators from human mast cells residing in airway, intestine, or skin.;Glucocorticoids are potent anti-inflammatory drugs that are widely used in the treatment of allergic disorders. Their actions are often species specific or cell-type specific. Previous studies have demonstrated that glucocorticoids inhibit mediator release from mast cells derived from the peritoneum of mouse or rat and from guinea pig lung, but not those residing in human lung parenchymal tissue. In the present study, we have analyzed the effect of overnight culture with dexamethasone (10(-6) to 10(-7)M) on the subsequent IgE-dependent release of mediators from human mast cells derived from airway tissue, intestine, and skin. Airway tissue was passively sensitized with antigen-specific, IgE-rich serum during the culture period and subsequently challenged with ragweed antigen E. Skin and intestinal mast cells were challenged with anti-IgE. Histamine and immunoreactive LTC4 and PGD2 release was monitored in all experiments. Prostaglandin E release was quantitated in the experiments using airway tissue. Dexamethasone treatment failed to inhibit the release of mast cell mediators from all three tissues, but it inhibited the antigen-induced release of immunoreactive PGE from other cells residing in airway tissue. These results confirm earlier studies of the effects of glucocorticoids on human lung parenchymal mast cells, but contrast with the inhibitory effects of steroids observed in murine mast cells and human basophils. ;polyglutamic;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

One approach has been to use DNA-binding proteins such as GAL4 from yeast as DNA carriers with nuclear targeting properties. We recently showed, however, that GAL4 is inefficient in targeting DNA to the nucleus because its DNA-binding and nuclear targeting activities are mutually exclusive, which relates to the fact that GAL4 nuclear import occurs via a novel pathway. Here, we 'switch' this pathway to a more conventional one by adding a modified poly-lysine to which an optimized nuclear targeting signal, based on that of the SV40 large T-antigen, is linked. We also use a chimeric GAL4-alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) fusion protein to enable gene transfer to cells expressing the MSH receptor. Switching the nuclear import pathway of the transfecting complex significantly enhances receptor-mediated gene transfer through enabling interaction with desired components of the cellular nuclear import machinery. The present study represents the first demonstration that nuclear targeting signals can enhance receptor-mediated gene delivery, the approaches having important relevance to research and clinical applications, such as in generating transgenic or knock-out animals, or in gene therapy. ;polylysine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
5820;8922345;Natriuretic peptides in sheep with pressure overload left ventricular hypertrophy.;To examine tissue and plasma atrial (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) responses to left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) 7 sheep underwent suprarenal aortic banding (20 mmHg initial pressure differential). Median survival time was 15 days. Proximal mean aortic pressure (MAP) increased from 65.1 +/- 5.0 mmHg (baseline) to 111.6 +/- 7.5 mmHg (day 7, p < 0.0001). Distal systolic aortic pressure fell from 85.5 +/- 8.7 mmHg (baseline) to 55.6 +/- 6.4 mmHg (day 7, p = 0.0002). Maximal plasma ANP (26.9 +/- 3.6 vs 10.1 +/- 1.2 pmol/L, p = 0.005) and BNP (15.3 +/- 3.6 vs. 3.5 +/- 1.0 pmol/L, p = 0.006) were recorded at 15 +/- 4.0 days. Coarctation induced rapid increases in PRA and plasma aldosterone and a fall in urinary sodium. Post-mortem examination of hearts confirmed LVH. Compared with controls, tissue ANP concentration was reduced in left atrium (p = 0.04) and LV (p = 0.04). BNP concentration was reduced in left atrium (p = 0.02) but tended to be higher in LV. In conclusion, suprarenal aortic coarctation leads to progressive hypertension resulting in LVH, progressive increases in plasma ANP and BNP and, in most cases, death from heart failure.;-;-;-;hard_0
5821;15802641;Compensating increases in protein backbone flexibility occur when the Dead ringer AT-rich interaction domain (ARID) binds DNA: a nitrogen-15 relaxation study.;AT-rich interaction domains (ARIDs) are found in a large number of eukaryotic transcription factors that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and development. Previously we elucidated how ARIDs recognize DNA by determining the solution structure of the Drosophila melanogaster Dead ringer protein in both its DNA-free and -bound states. In order to quantitatively determine how ARIDs alter their mobility to recognize DNA, we have measured the relaxation parameters of the backbone nitrogen-15 nuclei of Dead ringer in its free and bound forms, and interpreted these data using the model-free approach. We show that Dead ringer undergoes significant changes in its mobility upon binding, with residues in the loop connecting helices H5 and H6 becoming immobilized in the major groove and contacts to the minor groove slowing down the motion of residues at the C terminus. A DNA-induced rotation and displacement of the N-terminal subdomain of the protein increases the mobility of helix H1 located distal to the DNA interface and may partially negate the entropic cost of immobilizing interfacial residues. Elevated motions on the micro- to millisecond timescale in the N-terminal domain prior to DNA binding appear to foreshadow the DNA-induced conformation change. ;polythreonine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
5825;20529273;Field evaluation of a rapid diagnostic test (Parascreen) for malaria diagnosis in the Peruvian Amazon.;"The rapid diagnostic tests for malaria (RDT) constitute a fast and opportune alternative for non-complicated malaria diagnosis in areas where microscopy is not available. The objective of this study was to validate a RDT named Parascreen under field conditions in Iquitos, department of Loreto, Peru. Parascreen is a RDT that detects the histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) antigen from Plasmodium falciparum and lactate deshydrogenase from all Plasmodium species. Parascreen was compared with microscopy performed by experts (EM) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the following indicators: sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive (PV+) and negative predictive values (PV-), positive (LR+) and negative likehood ratio (LR-). 332 patients with suspected non-complicated malaria who attended to the MOH health centres were enrolled between October and December 2006. For P. falciparum malaria, Parascreen in comparison with EM, had Se: 53.5%, Sp: 98.7%, PV+: 66.7%, PV-: 97.8%, LR+: 42.27 and LR-: 0.47; and for non-P. falciparum malaria, Se: 77.1%, Sp: 97.6%, PV+: 91.4%, PV-: 92.7%, LR+: 32.0 and LR-: 0.22. The comparison of Parascreen with PCR showed, for P. falciparum malaria, Se: 81.8%, Sp: 99.1%, PV+: 75%, PV-: 99.4, LR+: 87.27 and LR-: 0.18; and for non-P. falciparum malaria Se: 76.1%, Sp: 99.2%, PV+: 97.1%, PV-: 92.0%, LR+: 92.51 and LR-: 0.24. The study results indicate that Parascreen is not a valid and acceptable test for malaria diagnosis under the field conditions found in the Peruvian Amazon. The relative proportion of Plasmodium species, in addition to the genetic characteristics of the parasites in the area, must be considered before applying any RDT, especially after the finding of P. falciparum malaria parasites lacking pfhrp2 gene in this region.

5831;8668199;MEF2B is a potent transactivator expressed in early myogenic lineages.;"There are four members of the myocyte enhancer binding factor 2 (MEF2) family of transcription factors, MEF2A, -B, -C, and -D, that have homology within an amino-terminal MADS box and an adjacent MEF2 domain that together mediate dimerization and DNA binding. MEF2A, -C, and -D have previously been shown to bind an A/T-rich DNA sequence in the control regions of numerous muscle-specific genes, whereas MEF2B was reported to be unable to bind this sequence unless the carboxyl terminus was deleted. To further define the functions of MEF2B, we analyzed its DNA binding and transcriptional activities. In contrast to previous studies, our results show that MEF2B binds the same DNA sequence as other members of the MEF2 family and acts as a strong transactivator through that sequence. Transcriptional activation by MEF2B is dependent on the carboxyl terminus, which contains two conserved sequence motifs found in all vertebrate MEF2 factors. During mouse embryogenesis, MEF2B transcripts are expressed in the developing cardiac and skeletal muscle lineages in a temporospatial pattern distinct from but overlapping with those of the other Mef2 genes. The mouse Mef2b gene maps to chromosome 8 and is unlinked to other Mef2 genes; its intron-exon organization is similar to that of the other vertebrate Mef2 genes and the single Drosophila Mef2 gene, consistent with the notion that these different Mef2 genes evolved from a common ancestral gene.

By in vitro methods we determined which HPA components are influenced by thiouracil-induced hypothyroidism in 15 day old rats. Our results indicate that adrenal response to ACTH stimulation and adenohypophysial ACTH content were not significantly modified by thiouracil exposure. On the other hand, the corticotropin-releasing factor-like activity of median eminence extracts was severely depressed by thiouracil-induced hypothyroidism. Thus, the delayed maturation of functional capacity of the central nervous system caused by hypothyroidism includes synthesis of biologically active corticotropin-releasing factor.;-;-;-;hard_0

In contrast, the estrogen-responsive element was not required for E2 responsiveness in MCF-7 cells, and using a series of constructs containing wild-type (pF1) and mutant 5'-flanking sequences (-1220 to -1155) from the c-fos protooncogene promoter in transient transfection assays, it was shown that a GC-rich motif (5'-GGGGCGTGG) containing an imperfect Sp1-binding site was required for hormone-induced activity. This sequence also bound Sp1 protein in gel mobility shift assays, and coincubation with the estrogen receptor (ER) enhanced Sp1-DNA binding. E2 and 4'-hydroxytamoxifen, but not ICI 164,384, induced reporter gene activity in cells transiently transfected with pF1. E2 induced reporter gene activity in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells transiently cotransfected with pF1 and wild-type ER or variant ER in which the DNA-binding domain was deleted (HE11); plasmids expressing N-terminal or C-terminal domains of the ER containing activator function-1 or -2, respectively, were inactive in these assays. In contrast, only wild-type ER mediated 4'-hydroxytamoxifen-induced activity.

Neurons were activated antidromically from thoracic spinal cord; recording sites were located in nucleus raphe magnus (NRM). Mean conduction velocity was 48 +/- 2 m/s. Urinary bladder distension (UBD) increased activity in 12 cells and decreased activity in 17 cells. Spontaneous bladder contractions also affected activity in raphespinal neurons responsive to UBD. Noxious pinch stimulus applied to proximal hindlimbs or forelimbs either increased or decreased activity in 28 raphespinal neurons. No cells were excited both by UBD and pinching of skin and deep tissues of the limbs. Thus, excitatory viscerosomatic convergence was not observed with the stimuli tested in raphespinal neurons examined in this study. Urinary bladder input to descending projection neurons in NRM might participate in descending modulation of dorsal horn neurons.

5838;8141348;Influence of endurance exercise training on distribution of vascular adaptations in rat skeletal muscle.;"We hypothesized that an exercise training program consisting of treadmill running at 32 m/min up a 15% incline, 90 min/day, 5 days/wk for 12-14 wk, would elicit vascular adaptation in skeletal muscle of all fiber types in rats. This hypothesis was based on previous reports that this intensity and duration of training caused increases in oxidative capacity in rat skeletal muscle of all fiber types. Skeletal muscle vascular transport capacity was examined with measurements of total and regional (radiolabeled microspheres) flow capacity, capillary filtration coefficient (CFC), and permeability-surface area product (PS) for 51Cr-EDTA in maximally vasodilated (papaverine) hindquarters of control (C; n = 25) and exercise-trained (ET; n = 26) rats. CFC was increased in ET (0.038 +/- 0.001 vs. 0.030 +/- 0.001 ml.min-1 x mmHg-1 x 100 g-1; P < or = 0.001). PS was greater in ET than C (7.80 +/- 0.33 vs. 6.39 +/- 0.37 ml.min-1 x 100 g-1; P < or = 0.01). Citrate synthase activity was increased in the soleus (25%; P < or = 0.05), the medial head (35%; P < or = 0.05), and the red portion of the long head (45%; P < or = 0.005) but not in the white portion of the long head of triceps brachii (P = 0.14) of ET rats. Pressure-flow relationships indicate that total flow was greater (P < or = 0.05) in ET hindquarters at all perfusion pressures. Regional flow data revealed that increases in flow capacity were not evident in muscles composed of all fiber types as predicted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)";-;-;-;hard_0
5839;1846206;Multicomponent origin of cytomegalovirus lytic-phase DNA replication.;"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) lytic-phase DNA replication requires both trans-acting factors, such as the virus-coded DNA polymerase, and a previously undefined cis-acting element, the origin, within which initiation occurs. We have located a candidate origin of CMV lytic-phase DNA replication, oriLyt, in both simian and human strains by assessing the ability of cloned restriction fragments to mediate phosphonoformic acid-sensitive DNA replication after transfection into human fibroblasts when required trans-acting factors were supplied by infection. In initial experiments the simian CMV-like strain Colburn EcoRI D fragment directed DNA replication; this fragment contains all of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein gene (dbp) and about 7 kbp of upstream sequence. A larger region upstream of human CMV dbp also mediated replication in transient assays. Subsequent subcloning and deletion analyses defined a CMV strain Colburn region sufficient for origin function, spanning about 1,300 bp in the apparently noncoding region upstream of dbp. The nucleotide sequence of this region revealed four distinct domains, containing (i) a 9-bp repeated sequence, (ii) an A+T-rich segment, (iii) an 11-bp direct repeat, and (iv) a 47-bp direct repeat. At least some part of each of these domains was required for origin function. Therefore, like the Epstein-Barr virus lytic-phase origin of DNA replication, CMV oriLyt appears to be structurally complex. ";polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
5841;8611586;Kinetic and mutational dissection of the two ATPase activities of terminase, the DNA packaging enzyme of bacteriophage Chi.;Terminase the DNA packaging enzyme of bacteriophage chi, is a heteromultimer of gpNul (21 kDa) and gpA (74 kDa) subunits, encoded by the chi Nul and A genes, respectively. Sequence comparisons indicate that both gpNu1 and gpA have a match to the P-loop motif of ATPase centers, which is a glycine-rich segment followed by a lysine. By site-specific mutagenesis, we changed the lysines of the putative P-loops of gpNul (k35) and gpA (K497) to arginine, alanine, or aspartic acid, and studied the mutant enzymes by kinetic analysis and photochemical cross-linking with 8-azido-ATP. Both the gpNul and gpA subunits of wild-type terminase were covalently modified with 8-N3[32P] ATP in the presence of UV light. Saturation occurred with apparent dissociation constants of 508 and 3.5 microM for gpNul and gpA, resepctively. ATPase assays showed two activities: a low-affinity activity (Km=469 microM), and a high-affinity activity (Km=4.6 microM). The gpNul K35A and gpNul K35D mutant terminases showed decreased activity in the low-affinity ATPase activity. The reduced activities of these enzymes were recovered when 10 times more DNA was added, suggesting that the primary defect of the enzymes is alteration of the nonspecific, double-stranded DNA binding activity of terminase. ATPase assays and photolabeling of the gpA K497A and gpA K497D mutant terminases showed reduced affinity for ATP at the high-affinity site which was not restored by increased DNA. In summary, the results indicate the presence of a low-affinity, DNA-stimulated ATPase center in gpNul, and a high-affinity site in gpA.; polyglycine ;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
5844;28756945;SIRT1 Functions as a Negative Regulator of Eukaryotic Poly(A)RNA Transport.;Most eukaryotic mRNAs are polyadenylated in the nucleus, and the poly(A)-tail is required for efficient mRNA export and translation. However, mechanisms governing mRNA transport remain unclear. Here, we report that the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 acts as an energy sensor and negatively regulates poly(A)RNA transport via deacetylating a poly(A)-binding protein, PABP1. Upon energy starvation, SIRT1 interacts with and deacetylates PABP1 and deactivates its poly(A)RNA binding, leading to nuclear accumulation of PABP1 and poly(A)RNA and thus facilitating eukaryotic cells to attenuate protein synthesis and energy consumption to adapt to energy stress. Moreover, AMPK-directed SIRT1 phosphorylation is required for energy starvation-induced PABP1-SIRT1 association, PABP1 deacetylation, and poly(A)RNA nuclear retention. In addition, the SIRT1-PABP1 association is not specific to energy starvation but represents a common stress response. These observations provide insights into dynamic modulation of eukaryotic mRNA transport and translation, suggesting that the poly(A)-tail also provides a basis for eukaryotes to effectively shut down mature mRNA transport and thereby tailor protein synthesis to maintain energy homeostasis under stress conditions. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
5845;6299333;Purification and properties of dihydroorotate oxidase from Crithidia fasciculata and Trypanosoma brucei.;"Dihydroorotate oxidases have been highly purified from the parasitic protozoa Crithidia fasciculata and Trypanosoma brucei. The Crithidia enzyme was purified 4200-fold from a crude soluble protein extract in four steps. The protein is a dimer as judged from the native (Mr 60 000) and subunit (Mr 32 700) molecular weights. The purified enzyme exhibits a characteristic flavin electronic spectrum, and each mole of native dimer contains 1.0 mol of tightly bound flavin mononucleotide. Under anaerobic conditions, the flavin chromophore is reduced upon addition of L-dihydroorotate. In air-saturated buffer, the enzyme catalyzes the conversion of L-dihydroorotate to orotate with concomitant reduction of equimolar amounts of molecular oxygen to hydrogen peroxide. A variety of low molecular weight oxidants (e.g., quinones or ferricyanide) may replace oxygen as the electron acceptor during catalysis. The dihydroorotate oxidase of T. brucei was purified 1400-fold to apparent homogeneity by a highly similar isolation procedure. The estimated native (Mr 62 000) and subunit (Mr 30 500) molecular weights indicated a dimeric protein comparable in size to the enzyme from Crithidia. These results suggest that dihydroorotate oxidation is mediated by flavoprotein oxidases in these parasitic protozoa rather than by pterin-linked hydroxylases as recently proposed [Kidder, G.

The soleus exhibits markedly lower motor unit firing rates (MUFRs; ∼16Hz) during maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVC) than other limb muscles, but this information is unknown for the MG and LG. During multiple visits, subjects performed a series of 5-7, ∼7-s plantar flexor MVCs with tungsten microelectrodes inserted into the MG and LG. During a separate testing session, another group of subjects performed submaximal isometric contractions at 25%, 50%, and 75% MVC with inserted fine-wires in the MG, LG and soleus. Maximum steady-state MUFRs for MG and LG (∼23Hz) were not different, but faster than prior reports for the soleus. No differences between the three triceps surae components were detected for 25% or 50% MVC, but at 75% MVC, the MG MUFRs were 31% greater than soleus. The triceps surae exhibit similar torque modulation strategies at <75% MVC, but to achieve higher contraction intensities (>75% MVC) the gastrocnemii rely on faster rates to generate maximal torque than the soleus. Therefore, the MG and LG exhibit a larger range of MUFR capacities.";-;-;-;hard_0

We tested the sensitivity and specificity of a histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2)-based, commercially available ELISA antigen detection assay for Plasmodium falciparum (Malaria Antigen CELISA; Cellabs, Sydney, Australia). A total of 700 whole blood samples obtained from symptomatic outpatients of malaria clinics along the Thai-Myanmar border were tested relative to blinded duplicate expert microscopy adjusted with species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR-adjusted microscopy showed that 79 (11.3%) were infected with P. falciparum, 118 (16.9%) with P. vivax, 1 (0.1%) with P. malariae, 7 (1.0%) with mixed infections (P. falciparum and P. vivax), and 495 (70.7%) were negative. The geometric mean parasite density for P. falciparum was 7547/muL (range: 12-363,810/muL). The overall sensitivity of the HRP2 ELISA for P. falciparum malaria was 98.8% (95% CI, 93.6-100%) and the specificity was 100% (95% CI, 99.5-100%). The positive and negative predictive values for the ELISA were 100% (95% CI, 96.5-100%) and 99.8% (95% CI, 99.1-100%), respectively. The results for P. falciparum were clearly superior to expert microscopy alone, particularly in mixed infections. Microscopy combined with ELISA reaches a sensitivity and specificity similar to PCR-adjusted microscopy for the diagnosis of P. falciparum while being considerably less expensive and faster. We conclude that ELISA serves as an excellent tool to augment microscopy as the gold standard for P. falciparum diagnosis in research settings and should be further evaluated for screening in blood banks.

5859;35622604;Venomics of the Central European Myrmicine Ants Myrmica rubra and Myrmica ruginodis.;Animal venoms are a rich source of novel biomolecules with potential applications in medicine and agriculture. Ants are one of the most species-rich lineages of venomous animals. However, only a fraction of their biodiversity has been studied so far. Here, we investigated the venom components of two myrmicine (subfamily Myrmicinae) ants: Myrmica rubra and Myrmica ruginodis. We applied a venomics workflow based on proteotranscriptomics and found that the venoms of both species are composed of several protein classes, including venom serine proteases, cysteine-rich secretory protein, antigen 5 and pathogenesis-related 1 (CAP) superfamily proteins, Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors and venom acid phosphatases. Several of these protein classes are known venom allergens, and for the first time we detected phospholipase A1 in the venom of M. ruginodis. We also identified two novel epidermal growth factor (EGF) family toxins in the M. ruginodis venom proteome and an array of additional EGF-like toxins in the venom gland transcriptomes of both species. These are similar to known toxins from the related myrmicine ant, Manica rubida, and the myrmecine (subfamily Myrmeciinae) Australian red bulldog ant Myrmecia gullosa, and are possibly deployed as weapons in defensive scenarios or to subdue prey. Our work suggests that M.rubra and M. ruginodis venoms contain many enzymes and other high-molecular-weight proteins that cause cell damage. Nevertheless, the presence of EGF-like toxins suggests that myrmicine ants have also recruited smaller peptide components into their venom arsenal. Although little is known about the bioactivity and function of EGF-like toxins, their presence in myrmicine and myrmecine ants suggests they play a key role in the venom systems of the superfamily Formicoidea. Our work adds to the emerging picture of ant venoms as a source of novel bioactive molecules and highlights the need to incorporate such taxa in future venom bioprospecting programs.;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

The values were similar to those previously reported for healthy newborn infants. We also measure lipoprotein and hepatic lipase activities with specific methods. Fifteen minutes after an intravenous heparin bolus of 100 IU/kg, mean lipoprotein lipase activity in infants (16.0 mumol free fatty acids/ml/h) was as in adults. In contrast, hepatic lipase activity was significantly higher in infants (54.3 mumol free fatty acids/ml/h) than in adults. There was no sex difference in the infant lipase activities. Lipoprotein and hepatic lipase activities were also measured 5 and 15 min after a heparin bolus of 10 and 50 IU/kg: 10 IU/kg released only part of the lipase activities. In addition, the two lipases were measured during the exchange transfusion. Although 92% of the original infant blood was removed, lipoprotein lipase activity remained constant. In contrast, hepatic lipase activity decreased considerably. In infants, postheparin lipolytic activity is a conventional measure of lipoprotein lipase. Lipoprotein and hepatic lipases comprise 95% of postheparin lipolytic activity. In our infants, hepatic lipase activity was 3.4 times higher than lipoprotein lipase activity. Hence, it seems unjustified to use postheparin lipolytic activity as a measure of lipoprotein lipase.;-;-;-;hard_0
5868;32415200;Cryo-EM structure of the volume-regulated anion channel LRRC8D isoform identifies features important for substrate permeation.;Members of the leucine-rich repeat-containing 8 (LRRC8) protein family, composed of the five LRRC8A-E isoforms, are pore-forming components of the volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC). LRRC8A and at least one of the other LRRC8 isoforms assemble into heteromers to generate VRAC transport activities.

Here, we present the structure of the human LRRC8D isoform, which enables the permeation of organic substrates through VRAC. The LRRC8D homo-hexamer structure displays a two-fold symmetric arrangement, and together with a structure-based electrophysiological analysis, revealed two key features. The pore constriction on the extracellular side is wider than that in the LRRC8A structures, which may explain the increased permeability of organic substrates. Furthermore, an N-terminal helix protrudes into the pore from the intracellular side and may be critical for gating.;polyleucine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
5869;32806033;Collagen-Inspired Helical Peptide Coassembly Forms a Rigid Hydrogel with Twisted Polyproline II Architecture.;"Collagen, the most abundant protein in mammals, possesses notable cohesion and elasticity properties and efficiently induces tissue regeneration. The Gly-Pro-Hyp canonical tripeptide repeating unit of the collagen superhelix has been well-characterized. However, to date, the shortest tripeptide repeat demonstrated to attain a helical conformation contained 3-10 peptide repeats. Here, taking a minimalistic approach, we studied a single repeating unit of collagen in its protected form, Fmoc-Gly-Pro-Hyp. The peptide formed single crystals displaying left-handed polyproline II superhelical packing, as in the native collagen single strand. The crystalline assemblies also display head-to-tail H-bond interactions and an ""aromatic zipper"" arrangement at the molecular interface. The coassembly of this tripeptide, with Fmoc-Phe-Phe, a well-studied dipeptide hydrogelator, produced twisted helical fibrils with a polyproline II conformation and improved hydrogel mechanical rigidity. The design of these peptides illustrates the possibility to assemble superhelical nanostructures from minimal collagen-inspired peptides with their potential use as functional motifs to introduce a polyproline II conformation into hybrid hydrogel assemblies.";polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function
5872;9305935;A DNA-binding element for a steroid receptor-binding factor is flanked by dual nuclear matrix DNA attachment sites in the c-myc gene promoter.;The receptor-binding factor (RBF) for the avian oviduct progesterone (Pg) receptor (PR) has previously been shown to be a unique 10-kDa nuclear matrix protein that generates high affinity PR-binding sites on avian DNA. This paper describes the use of Southwestern blot and DNA gel shift analyses with RBF protein to identify a minimal 54-base pair RBF-binding element in the matrix-associated region (MAR) of the Pg-regulated c-myc gene promoter. This element contains a 5'-GC-rich domain and a 3'-AT-rich domain, the latter of which has a homopurine/homopyrimidine structure. The gel shift assays required the generation of an RBF-maltose fusion protein (RBF-MBP), which specifically binds this element and is supershifted when the anti-RBF polyclonal antibody is added. Computer analysis of the full-length amino acid sequence for RBF predicts a DNA-binding motif involving a beta-sheet structure at the N-terminal domain. Southern blot analyses using nuclear matrix DNA suggests that there are dual MAR sites in the c-myc promoter, which flank an intervening domain containing the RBF element. The co-transfection of this MAR sequence, containing the RBF element and cloned into a luciferase reporter vector, together with an RBF expression vector construct, into steroid treated human MCF-7 cells, results in a decrease of the c-myc promoter activity relative to control transfections containing only the parent vector of the RBF expression construct. These data suggest that a unique chromatin/nuclear matrix structure, composed of the RBF-DNA element complex which is flanked by nuclear matrix attachment sites, serves to bind the PR and repress the c-myc promoter.;polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
5874;8448110;Sequence-selective binding of amiloride to DNA.;"Nuclease footprinting techniques have been employed to investigate the interaction between the diuretic drug amiloride, a sodium channel blocker with potential therapeutic use in the treatment of cystic fibrosis, and three DNA fragments of defined sequence. Using either DNAse I or micrococcal nuclease as probes, an unusual pattern of sequence-selective recognition of DNA has been detected. Amiloride binds selectively to sites rich in adenine and thymine residues, frequently with an apparent preference for 5'-TpX-3' steps, and discriminates strongly against GC-rich sequences which are sometimes cut more readily in the presence of the drug compared to the control. A detailed comparison with the actions of known selective DNA-binding antibiotics and drugs reveals a unique pattern of binding sites, different from those of typical intercalators on the one hand and those of minor groove-binders on the other. Amiloride is believed to adopt a pH-dependent tricyclic hydrogen-bonded conformation in solution which allows it to intercalate into DNA; consistent with this belief, we find that the footprinting pattern largely disappears at pH values above the pKa. Preliminary studies with three amiloride analogues have indicated the importance of two functional groups in the recognition of DNA. The possible relevance of selective DNA binding to activity in vivo is considered.";polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

5876;8959645;Effects of erythromycin and roxithromycin on oxidation of testosterone and nifedipine catalyzed by CYP3A4 in human liver microsomes.;"Roxithromycin and erythromycin were incubated with rat and human liver microsomal or reconstituted cytochrome P450 (P450 or CYP) monooxygenase systems in the presence of an NADPH-generating system, and the effects of these chemicals on testosterone 6 beta-hydroxylation and nifedipine oxidation activities were compared with those of typical CYP3A4 inhibitors including ketoconazole, troleandomycin, and gestodene. Roxithromycin and erythromycin were found to be relatively weak inhibitors of testosterone 6 beta-hydroxylation and nifedipine oxidation activities by rat and human liver microsomes or by reconstituted systems containing CYP3A4/5. Formation of an inhibitory P450-metabolite complex was determined spectrally by incubating troleandomycin with human liver microsomes; the extents of the complex formation were lesser in liver microsomes of humans than those of rats treated with dexamethasone. Erythromycin and roxithromycin were also activated slightly by rat liver microsomes to form P450.Fe(II)-metabolite complex, although these chemicals caused very little or undetectable levels, respectively, of spectral changes by human liver microsomes even when a human sample which contained relatively high levels of CYP3A4 was used. These results suggested that roxithromycin and erythromycin were relatively less potent to inhibit CYP3A4-catalytic activities in human liver microsomes, because of their low capabilities to form P450.Fe(II)-metabolite complex.";-;-;-;hard_0

There was concomitant tachycardia (average peak response 15.9 +/- 1.5 beats/min, range 4--45 beats/min) which was only slightly correlated with the blood-pressure rise. After the peak response blood pressure declined and at the end of the visit was only slightly above the pre-visit level.

5883;23732819;Hybrid electron microscopy-FRET imaging localizes the dynamical C-terminus of Tfg2 in RNA polymerase II-TFIIF with nanometer precision.;TFIIF-a general transcription factor comprising two conserved subunits can associate with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) tightly to regulate the synthesis of messenger RNA in eukaryotes. Herein, a hybrid method that combines electron microscopy (EM) and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is described and used to localize the C-terminus of the second TFIIF subunit (Tfg2) in the architecture of RNAPII-TFIIF. In the first stage, a poly-histidine tag appended to the Tfg2 C-terminus was labeled with nickel-NTA nanogold and a seven-step single particle EM protocol was devised to obtain the region accessible by the nanogold in 3D, suggesting the Tfg2 C-terminus is proximal to the clamp of RNAPII. Next, the C-termini of the Rpb2 and the Rpb4 subunits of RNAPII, adjacent to the clamp, were selected for placing FRET satellites to enable the nano-positioning (NP) analysis, by which the localization precision was improved such that the Tfg2 C-terminus was found to dwell on the clamp ridge but could move to the clamp top during transcription. Because the tag receptive to the EM or FRET probes can be readily introduced to any protein subunit, this hybrid approach is generally applicable to complement cryo-EM study of many protein complexes to nanometer precision.  ;polyhistidine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

In other patients vaccination was avoided by a 10-day veterinarian surveillance of the dog.

5892;8165699;Evaluation of sequential serum interleukin-6 levels in liver allograft recipients.;"Control serum levels of IL-6 measured by ELISA in 30 healthy blood donors or volunteers were 18 +/- 34 pg/ml (mean +/- SD). Pretransplant serum levels of IL-6 in 169 adult candidates for liver transplantation were significantly higher than control in those with fulminant hepatitis (203 +/- 232 pg/ml), alcoholic cirrhosis (116 +/- 257 pg/ml), and hepatocellular carcinoma (82 +/- 105 pg/ml). With these data as background, plasma or serum levels of IL-6 were monitored in 24 adult patients after first OLT and correlated with the clinical courses and the histopathological diagnosis of rejection. Serum or plasma levels of IL-6 decreased after transplantation regardless of pretransplant value. Four patients with infection subsequently developed continuously high IL-6 values. In the 20 of 24 patients who did not have infection, significantly higher levels of IL-6 were consistently found 0-4 days before histopathological diagnosis of rejection (131 +/- 78 pg/ml) compared with significantly lower values in patients without rejection episodes (40 +/- 21 pg/ml). The elevations of IL-6 were spike shaped, did not correlate well with the histopathological grades of rejection, and were highly responsive to augmented immunosuppression. These 20 cases were classified as: group 1, no spikes of IL-6 after liver transplantation; group 2, single spike of IL-6 after liver transplantation; and group 3, multiple spikes of IL-6 after liver transplantation. The combined early and late graft loss of each group was 0% (group 1), 25% (group 2), and 67% (group 3). We conclude that daily monitored serum or plasma IL-6 levels can be a good premonitor of liver allograft rejection and also a useful predictor of long-term graft outcome.";-;-;-;hard_0
5897;678554;Human serum histidine-rich glycoprotein. I. Interactions with heme, metal ions and organic ligands.;"The 3.8 S alpha2-histidine-rich glycoprotein of human serum is composed of two non-identical subunits, each of which contains carbohydrate. The far ultraviolet circular dichroism spectrum of alpha2-histidine glycoprotein indicates that the protein has little alpha-helix but apparently appreciable amounts of beta-sheet and non-regular structures. alpha2-Histidine-rich glycoprotein binds heme with concomitant changes in the electrophoretic mobility of the protein, in the fluorescence of tryptophan residues, and in the absorption and optical activity of the heme chromophore. By fluorescence quenching, the stoichiometry of binding is 1 heme per alpha2-histidine-rich glycoprotein molecule with an apparent Kd near 1.5 muM; however, by changes in absorbance, the interaction of 9 to 10 additional heme molecules with the alpha protein can be detected. The absorption spectra of heme . alpha2-histidine-rich glycoprotein complexes resemble those of low-spin hemoproteins. The ellipticity induced in the heme chromophore on binding by alpha2-histidine-rich glycoprotein increases linearly up to about 10 hemes bound per mol protein. No change in the conformation of alpha2-histidine-rich glycoprotein was indicated by circular dichroism when one or two heme molecules are bound by the protein. alpha2-Histidine-rich glycoprotein does not effectively compete with human serum albumin for heme, suggesting that alpha2-histidine-rich glycoprotein has no major function in serum heme transport. Nonetheless, the binding of heme by alpha2-histidine-rich glycoprotein provides a means of studying the structure of this protein using the heme chromophore as a probe. alpha2-Histidine-rich glycoprotein also binds other organic molecules including bilirubin, diaquocobinamide, Cibacron blue F3GA and rose bengal, and certain divalent metals. It is of interest that copper, zinc, nickel, cadmium and cobalt effectively inhibit the binding of heme by alpha2-histidine-rich glycoprotein, whereas other divalent metals tested, including calcium, magnesium and manganese do not appreciably affect the heme-alpha2-histidine-rich glycoprotein interaction.";polyhistidine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
5901;24116108;MglA/SspA complex interactions are modulated by inorganic polyphosphate.;The transcription factors MglA and SspA of Francisella tularensis form a heterodimer complex and interact with the RNA polymerase to regulate the expression of the Francisella pathogenicity island (FPI) genes. These genes are essential for this pathogen's virulence and survival within host cells. Our goal was to determine if an intracellular metabolite modulate these protein/protein interactions. In this study, we identified inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) as a signal molecule that promotes the interaction of MglA and SspA from F. tularensis SCHU S4. Analysis of the Mgla/SspA interaction was carried out using a two-hybrid system. The Escherichia coli reporter strain contained a deletion on the ppK-ppX operon, inhibiting polyP synthesis. The interaction between MglA and SspA was significantly impaired, as was the interaction between the MglA/SspA complex and the regulatory protein, FevR, indicating the stabilizing effect of polyP. In F. tularensis, chromatin immune precipitation studies revealed that in the absence of polyP, binding of the MglA/SspA complex to the promoter region of the pdpD, iglA, fevR and ppK genes is decreased. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) indicated that polyP binds directly to the MglA/SspA complex with high affinity (KD = 0.3 µM). These observations directly correlated with results obtained from calorimetric scans (DSC), where a strong shift in the mid-transition temperature (Tm) of the MglA/SspA complex was observed in the presence of polyP.  ;polyproline;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

5904;28721018;Salidroside pretreatment attenuates apoptosis and autophagy during hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury by inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in mice.;Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) contributes to liver damage in many clinical situations, such as liver resection and liver transplantation. In the present study, we investigated the effects of the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer agent salidroside (Sal) on hepatic IRI in mice. The mice were randomly divided into six groups: normal control, Sham, Sal (20 mg/kg), IRI, IRI + Sal (10 mg/kg), and IRI + Sal (20 mg/kg). We measured liver enzymes, proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and interleukin-6, and apoptosis- and autophagy-related marker proteins at 2, 8, and 24 hours after reperfusion. Components of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, including P-38, jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), were also measured using an MAPK activator anisomycin to deduce their roles in hepatic IRI. Our results show that Sal safely protects hepatocytes from IRI by reducing levels of liver enzymes in the serum. These findings were confirmed by histopathology. We concluded that Sal protects hepatocytes from IRI partly by inhibiting the activation of MAPK signaling, including the phosphorylation of P38, JNK, and ERK. This ameliorates inflammatory reactions, apoptosis, and autophagy in the mouse liver.;-;-;-;hard_0
5906;16051448;The canine telomerase catalytic subunit (dogTERT): characterisation of the gene promoter and identification of proximal core sequences necessary for specific transcriptional activity in canine telomerase positive cell lines.;Telomerase biology is complicated by studies that show that telomere expression and telomere biology differs between species, and that existing animal models do not closely resemble the human situation. We have previously reported a description of telomere/telomerase biology in the dog and have suggested this as an alternative model system. To further elucidate telomerase biology in this species we have cloned and characterised the canine reverse transcriptase (dogTERT) promoter. We demonstrate that core promoter activity is contained within a region extending approximately 300 bp upstream of the ATG codon. Transient transfections in telomerase-positive canine cell lines and telomerase negative fibroblasts showed that the promoter is only active in telomerase positive cell lines. Sequence analysis demonstrated that the 5' regulatory region is GC-rich and contains no TATA or CAAT box, similar to the human TERT promoter. Motif searches revealed the presence of multiple transcription factor binding sites common to both the human and canine TERT promoters, including a single E-box, Sp1, AP1, MZF-2 and ER/Sp1 binding sites. These findings suggest that the dogTERT gene shares similar transcriptional control to hTERT. Identification of the core promoter necessary for activity may allow the use of naturally occurring cancers in dogs as a preclinical testing ground for telomerase targeted therapies in human cancer patients. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

Cell Res. 233:11-20, 1997), using a transient transfection assay and an ectopic, readily visible marker, green fluorescent protein. This cDNA encodes a 359-amino-acid membrane protein of peroxisomes with two transmembrane segments and a cysteine-rich zinc finger, the RING motif. A stable transformant of ZP109 with the PEX12 was morphologically and biochemically restored for peroxisome biogenesis. Pex12p was shown by expression of bona fide as well as epitope-tagged Pex12p to expose both N- and C-terminal regions to the cytosol. Fibroblasts derived from patients with the peroxisome deficiency Zellweger syndrome of complementation group III (CG-III) were also complemented for peroxisome biogenesis with PEX12. Two unrelated patients of this group manifesting peroxisome deficiency disorders possessed homozygous, inactivating PEX12 mutations: in one, Arg180Thr by one point mutation, and in the other, deletion of two nucleotides in codons for 291Asn and 292Ser, creating an apparently unchanged codon for Asn and a codon 292 for termination. These results indicate that the gene encoding peroxisome assembly factor Pex12p is a pathogenic gene of CG-III peroxisome deficiency. Moreover, truncation and site mutation studies, including patient PEX12 analysis, demonstrated that the cytoplasmically oriented N- and C-terminal parts of Pex12p are essential for biological function. ;polycysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
5909;23163801;New models of Tetrahymena telomerase RNA from experimentally derived constraints and modeling.;The telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex ensures complete replication of eukaryotic chromosomes. Telomerase RNA (TER) provides the template for replicating the G-rich strand of telomeric DNA, provides an anchor site for telomerase-associated proteins, and participates in catalysis through several incompletely characterized mechanisms. A major impediment toward understanding its nontemplating roles is the absence of high content structural information for TER within the telomerase complex. Here, we used selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) to examine the structure of Tetrahymena TER free in solution and bound to tTERT in the minimal telomerase RNP. We discovered a striking difference in the two conformations and established direct evidence for base triples in the tTER pseudoknot. We then used SHAPE data, previously published FRET data, and biochemical inference to model the structure of tTER using discrete molecular dynamics simulations. The resulting tTER structure was docked with a homology model of the Tetrahymena telomerase  reverse transcriptase (tTERT) to characterize the conformational changes of tTER telomerase assembly. Free in solution, tTER appears to contain four pairing regions: stems I, II, and IV, which are present in the commonly accepted structure, and stem III, a large paired region that encompasses the template and pseudoknot domains. Our interpretation of the data and subsequent modeling affords a molecular model for telomerase assemblage in which a large stem III of tTER unwinds to allow proper association of the template with the tTERT active site and formation of the pseudoknot. Additionally, analysis of our SHAPE data and previous enzymatic footprinting allow us to propose a model for stem-loop IV function in which tTERT is activated by binding stem IV in the major groove of the helix-capping loop. ;polyglycine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
5911;9832924;Towards a cross-species pharmacology of sensorimotor gating: effects of amantadine, bromocriptine, pergolide and ropinirole on prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle in rats.;Animal models in behavioral pharmacology can be evaluated based on their face, predictive and construct validity. A further level of validity may be achieved if a model is reproduced precisely across species--from laboratory animal to human--using identical conditions and manipulations to elicit identical behavioral changes. Under circumstances in which a model achieves 'homologous' validity, it should be possible to demonstrate that the same pharmacological agents produce parallel changes in the same behavior (as distinct from the clinical condition that the animal behaviors are hypothesized to model), when studied in laboratory animals and in humans. Studies have demonstrated that the disruption of sensorimotor gating of the startle reflex, measured by prepulse inhibition (PPI), in rats by dopamine agonists exhibits face, predictive and construct validity for the relative loss of PPI in schizophrenia patients. To assess the homologous validity of this model, and to expand its utility in understanding the pathophysiology of sensorimotor gating deficits and in developing novel antipsychotic agents to reverse these deficits, it will be important to study PPI across species, comparing response profiles to identical pharmacological manipulations. In the present studies, we report that PPI in rats is reduced in a dose-dependent manner by four dopamine agonists that can be administered with relative ease to humans. We also report that the PPI-disruptive effects of the clinically useful dopamine agonist pergolide are reversed by both typical and atypical antipsychotics. These studies establish a foundation for pursuing human pharmacological studies of PPI, and for extrapolating the substantial neurochemical and neurophysiological information from animal studies of PPI, towards understanding the neural basis for deficient sensorimotor gating in specific neuropsychiatric disorders.;-;-;-;hard_0
5915;24590458;The involvement of mRNA processing factors TIA-1, TIAR, and PABP-1 during mammalian hibernation.;"Mammalian hibernators survive low body temperatures, ischemia-reperfusion, and restricted nutritional resources via global reductions in energy-expensive cellular processes and selective increases in stress pathways. Consequently, studies that analyze hibernation uncover mechanisms which balance metabolism and support survival by enhancing stress tolerance. We hypothesized processing factors that influence messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) maturation and translation may play significant roles in hibernation. We characterized the amino acid sequences of three RNA processing proteins (T cell intracellular antigen 1 (TIA-1), TIA1-related (TIAR), and poly(A)-binding proteins (PABP-1)) from thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus), which all displayed a high degree of sequence identity with other mammals. Alternate Tia-1 and TiaR gene variants were found in the liver with higher expression of isoform b versus a in both cases. The localization of RNA-binding proteins to subnuclear structures was assessed by immunohistochemistry and confirmed by subcellular fractionation; TIA-1 was identified as a major component of subnuclear structures with up to a sevenfold increase in relative protein levels in the nucleus during hibernation. By contrast, there was no significant difference in the relative protein levels of TIARa/TIARb in the nucleus, and a decrease was observed for TIAR isoforms in cytoplasmic fractions of torpid animals. Finally, we used solubility tests to analyze the formation of reversible aggregates that are associated with TIA-1/R function during stress; a shift towards the soluble fraction (TIA-1a, TIA-1b) was observed during hibernation suggesting enhanced protein aggregation was not present during torpor. The present study identifies novel posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms that may play a role in reducing translational rates and/or mRNA processing under unfavorable environmental conditions.

Base substitutions were introduced into 16 of the 18 palindromic residues by targeted saturation mutagenesis. The GH3 binding and in vitro transcription assays of the mutated promoters showed that base substitutions within the 5'-ATATTCA-3' sequence located at -52 to -46 were detrimental to PUF-I binding and its cell-type-specific transcriptional enhancement activity. Transcription assays of the mutated promoters performed with several nonpituitary-derived extracts demonstrated that a distal TATA box located from -59 to -53 promotes initiation at -27. Thus, the cell-type-specific cis-acting element required by PUF-I for DNA recognition is immediately adjacent to a general TATA sequence. Base substitutions that decreased +1 transcription and PUF-I binding concomitantly increased -27 initiation of RNA in vitro. We suggest that PUF-I binding in pituitary cells potentiates +1 transcription and represses alternative TATA box activity for initiation events occurring at -27.

Localization of an intron EBV-responsive enhancer and characterization of its cognate GC-box binding factors.;EBV infection of human B lymphocytes induces expression of the low affinity IgE receptor, Fc epsilon RII/CD23. CD23 is constitutively expressed in EBV-immortalized B cells and may play an essential role in immortalization. We previously explored the regulation of CD23 by EBV, showing that induction results from transcriptional activation that is mediated, in part, by an EBV-responsive transcriptional regulatory element in the 5' region of CD23 (-229 to +305 relative to the type a promoter). We now report the localization of the regulatory element and characterization of its cognate DNA-binding proteins. Reporter gene assays in EBV-positive and -negative lines localized a functional EBV-responsive enhancer to a 37-bp fragment (+248 to +284) that contains a GC-rich sequence (GC box) within intron I of type a CD23. This fragment was shown by mobility shift assays to specifically bind nuclear protein(s) from EBV-positive lines, but not EBV-negative lines. Mutation of the GC box resulted in a loss of protein-binding activity, implicating involvement of a GC box-binding protein in the DNA/protein interaction. Supershift assays suggested that the ubiquitous GC box-binding transcription factor, Sp1, is not a part of the complex, and UV-crosslinking studies demonstrated that the DNA/protein complex contains at least two proteins that differ in size from other known GC box-binding proteins. Binding of these proteins to the enhancer element requires phosphorylation, because phosphatase treatment of nuclear extracts abolished formation of the DNA/protein complex. These studies reveal the presence of an EBV-responsive enhancer element in intron I of type a CD23 and implicate a GC box-binding transcription factor in the activation of CD23 by EBV. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
5926;9368937;Amnesia and neglect: beyond the Delay-Brion system and the Hebb synapse.;"Hippocampal damage in people causes impairments of episodic memory, but in rats it causes impairments of spatial learning. Experiments in macaque monkeys show that these two kinds of impairment are functionally similar to each other. After any lesion that interrupts the Delay-Brion system (hippocampus, fornix, mamillary bodies and anterior thalamus) monkeys are impaired in scene-specific memory, where an event takes place against a background that is specific to that event. Scene-specific memory in the monkey corresponds to human episodic memory, which is the memory of a unique event set in a particular scene, as opposed to scene-independent human knowledge, which is abstracted from many different scenes. However, interruption of the Delay-Brion system is not sufficient to explain all of the memory impairments that are seen in amnesic patients. To explain amnesia the specialized function of the hippocampus in scene memory needs to be considered alongside the other, qualitatively different functional specializations of other memory systems of the temporal lobe, including the perirhinal cortex and the amygdala. In all these specialized areas, however, including the hippocampus, there is no fundamental distinction between memory systems and perceptual systems. In explaining memory disorders in amnesia it is also important to consider them alongside the memory disorders of neglect patients. Neglect patients fail to represent in memory the side of the world that is contralateral to the current fixation point, in both short- and long-term memory retrieval. Neglect was produced experimentally by unilateral visual disconnection in the monkey, confirming the idea that visual memory retrieval is retinotopically organized; patients with unilateral medial temporal-lobe removals showed lateralized memory impairments for half-scenes in the visual hemifield contralateral to the removal. Thus, in scene-memory retrieval the Delay-Brion system contributes to the retrieval of visual memories into the retinotopically organized visual cortex. This scene memory interpretation of hippocampal function needs to be contrasted with the cognitive-map hypothesis. The cognitive-map model of hippocampal function shares some common assumptions with the Hebb-synapse model of association formation, and the Hebb-synapse model can be rejected on the basis of recent evidence that monkeys can form direct associations in memory between temporally discontiguous events. Our general conclusion is that the primate brain encompasses widespread and powerful memory mechanisms which will continue to be poorly understood if theory and experimentation continue to concentrate too much, as they have in the past, on the hippocampus and the Hebb synapse.";-;-;-;hard_0
5929;21960586;SIV infection of rhesus macaques results in dysfunctional T- and B-cell responses to neo and recall Leishmania major vaccination.;HIV infection is characterized by immune system dysregulation, including depletion of CD4+ T cells, immune activation, and abnormal B- and T-cell responses. However, the immunologic mechanisms underlying lymphocytic dysfunctionality and whether it is restricted to immune responses against neo antigens, recall antigens, or both is unclear. Here, we immunized SIV-infected and uninfected rhesus macaques to induce immune responses against neo and recall antigens using a Leishmania major polyprotein (MML) vaccine given with poly-ICLC adjuvant. We found that vaccinated SIVuninfected animals induced high frequencies of polyfunctional MML-specific CD4+ T cells. However, in SIV-infected animals, CD4+ T-cell functionality decreased after both neo (P = .0025) and recall (P = .0080) MML vaccination. Furthermore, after SIV infection, the frequency of MML-specific antibody-secreting classic memory B cells was decreased compared with vaccinated, SIV-uninfected animals. Specifically, antibody-secreting classic memory B cells that produced IgA in response to either neo (P = .0221) or recall (P = .0356) MML vaccinations were decreased. Furthermore, we found that T-follicular helper cells, which are essential for priming B cells, are preferentially infected with SIV. These data indicate that SIV infection results in dysfunctional T-cell responses to neo and recall vaccinations, and direct SIV infection of T-follicular helper cells, both of which probably contribute to deficient B-cell responses and, presumably, susceptibility to certain opportunistic infections. ;polyisoleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
5931;9159465;RNA polymerase I transcription termination: similar mechanisms are employed by yeast and mammals.;Termination of RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription requires the interaction of a specific DNA binding factor with terminator elements downstream of the pre-rRNA coding region. Both the terminator elements and the respective termination factors are distinct in yeast and mammals, and differences in the mechanism of transcription termination have been postulated. We have compared in vitro transcription termination of yeast and mouse Pol I using both the murine factor TTF-I, and the yeast homolog Reb1p. We show that, similar to TTF-I, Reb1p was sufficient for pausing of Pol I from either species, but was unable to cause release of the nascent transcripts from the paused ternary complex. The deficiency of Reb1p to mediate transcript release from Pol I of either species was complemented by the recently characterized murine release factor. Thus, both yeast and mouse Pol I termination requires a trans-acting factor that, in conjunction with the T-rich flanking sequence, releases the transcripts and Pol I from the template. The observation that the murine factor causes dissociation of ternary transcription complexes arrested by Reb1p suggests that the mechanism of Pol I termination is highly conserved from yeast to mammals. ;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

5936;19672695;A proteomic analysis of oligo(dT)-bound mRNP containing oxidative stress-induced Arabidopsis thaliana RNA-binding proteins ATGRP7 and ATGRP8.;"Plants are highly adapted to respond to a range of environmental stresses commonly by altering their gene expression and metabolism as a result of cell signalling which may be mediated by reactive oxygen species. The glycine-rich RNA-binding proteins ATGRP7 and ATGRP8 were rapidly upregulated in response to peroxide-induced oxidative stress and were amongst the most abundant RNA binding proteins isolated by oligo(dT) chromatography. The oligo(dT)-bound mRNP complexes were analysed proteomically, and were seen to contain potential isoforms of the ATGRP proteins; other proteins that contain an RNA Recognition Motif (RRM); and chloroplast RNA binding proteins. These findings suggest that ATGRP proteins have an evolutionarily conserved function in the regulation of gene expression at the posttranscriptional level in response to environmental stress.

5938;12535682;Identification of an immuno-protective mucin-like protein, peritrophin-55, from the peritrophic matrix of Lucilia cuprina larvae.;A mucin-like glycoprotein, peritrophin-55 was isolated and purified from the peritrophic matrix of Lucilia cuprina larvae. When injected into sheep, peritrophin-55 induced an immune response that inhibited larval growth by 51-66% when larvae subsequently fed on sera from the vaccinated sheep. The protein may have potential use as an immunogen probably accompanying other antigens to protect sheep from the cutaneous myiasis caused by these larvae. Peritrophin-55 was uniformly distributed throughout the peritrophic matrix where it probably lubricates the surface of the peritrophic matrix and protects the midgut from invasion by bacteria. The protein consists of an 8-cysteine amino-terminal domain (peritrophin-B domain) and a carboxy-terminal proline and threonine-rich domain with high probability for extensive O-linked glycosylation. The gene consists of two exons separated by a small intron. Peritrophin-55 mRNA was only detected in the larval cardia and midgut and to a minor extent in the hindgut. Sequence upstream of the transcriptional start site contained a putative promoter region, sequence similar to an ecdysone response element, sequence related to the Drosophila transposon S element and a tetranucleotide repeat region. A putative Drosophila melanogaster ortholog or paralog of peritrophin-55 (CG7714) was located within a 3458 bp intron of the Cha gene (choline-O-acetyltransferase), but on the opposite strand. Comparison of the putative promoter regions of the peritrophin-55 and CG7714 genes revealed little similarity except for a small semi-conserved sequence that is suggestive of a common transcription factor-binding site possibly contributing to the highly restricted developmental and tissue-specific expression patterns of these genes. ;polythreonine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
5939;2450952;"Protamine-reactive natural IgM antibodies in human sera. Characterization of the epitope demonstrates specificity of antigenic recognition; occurrence indicates obscurity of origin and function.";"We have identified a set of natural IgM antibodies in human serum that are reactive with protamines, a class of low molecular weight basic nucleoproteins that are synthesized de novo in the postpubertal testis and are unique to sperm. Those antibodies were detected by ELISA in significant titer in all of 100 sera of normal adult males and females and in 26 of 28 sera of normal pediatrics aged 7 d to 2 yr. Commonality between the protamine-reactive IgM antibodies of pediatric and adult sera was established by the demonstration of similarity in antigen recognition and reaction kinetics. Therefore, the role of protamines as either immunogenic stimulus or antigenic target of that set of natural antibodies is not likely. The antigenic site recognized by the protein-reactive serum IgM antibodies was characterized by comparison with the pattern of antigen recognition by a monoclonal antibody to human sperm protamines (HPmAb). By the use of synthetic peptides simulating the amino acid sequences of various segments of human protamine 2 and of polyarginine, polylysine, and histones as test antigens, the principle characteristic of the antigenic site recognized by both HPmAb and the serum IgM antibodies was inferred to be that of clustered arginyl residues with an apparent minimum requirement of four arginyl residues, including a triplet, within a six residue piece; for both, the reaction was shown to be not dependent upon charge attraction. A series of immunoabsorption procedures indicated that the protamine-reactive serum IgM antibodies are a discrete set with a high order of specificity. A search of protein data bases revealed that the putative minimum epitope is present in four or five human autogenous proteins, all moieties of the immune system, and in a number of viral proteins. The possible implications of those findings are discussed in the light of early hypotheses concerning the origin and function of natural antibodies and the many recent reports of identification of natural antibodies in normal human sera. The set of natural antibodies identified in this study may be unique or may represent a class of antibodies present in the repertoire that, by virtue of the obscurity of their origin or function, have not been previously or extensively recognized.";polyarginine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
5943;10722314;Yra1p, a conserved nuclear RNA-binding protein, interacts directly with Mex67p and is required for mRNA export.;Mex67p and Mtr2p constitute an essential mRNA export complex that interacts with poly(A)+ RNA and nuclear pore proteins. We have identified Yra1p, an intranuclear protein with in vitro RNA-RNA annealing activity, which directly binds to Mex67p. The complex between Yra1p and Mex67p was reconstituted in vitro and shown by UV-crosslinking to bind directly to RNA. Mutants of YRA1 are impaired in nuclear poly(A)+ RNA export at restrictive growth conditions. ALY, the mouse homologue of Yra1p and a transcriptional coactivator, can bind in vitro to yeast and human Mex67p and partly complements the otherwise non-viable yra1 null mutant. Thus, Yra1p is the first RNA-binding protein characterized, which bridges the shuttling Mex67p/Mtr2p exporter to intranuclear mRNA transport cargoes. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

5945;24622240;Microarray meta-analysis of RNA-binding protein functions in alternative polyadenylation.;Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a post-transcriptional mechanism to generate diverse mRNA transcripts with different 3'UTRs from the same gene. In this study, we systematically searched for the APA events with differential expression in public mouse microarray data. Hundreds of genes with over-represented differential APA events and the corresponding experiments were identified. We further revealed that global APA differential expression occurred prevalently in tissues such as brain comparing to peripheral tissues, and biological processes such as development, differentiation and immune responses. Interestingly, we also observed widespread differential APA events in RNA-binding protein (RBP) genes such as Rbm3, Eif4e2 and Elavl1. Given the fact that RBPs are considered as the main regulators of differential APA expression, we constructed a co-expression network between APAs and RBPs using the microarray data. Further incorporation of CLIP-seq data of selected RBPs showed that Nova2 represses and Mbnl1 promotes the polyadenylation of closest poly(A) sites respectively. Altogether, our study is the first microarray meta-analysis in a mammal on the regulation of APA by RBPs that integrated massive mRNA expression data under a wide-range of biological conditions. Finally, we present our results as a comprehensive resource in an online website for the research community.  ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
5951;9313763;Identification of mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1 alpha gene in Japanese subjects with IDDM.;One form of maturity-onset diabetes of the young, MODY3, is characterized by a severe insulin secretory defect, compared with MODY2, a glucokinase-deficient diabetes. It has recently been shown that mutations of the gene encoding the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1 alpha cause MODY3. Because of the rapid progress to overt diabetes and the high prevalence of required insulin treatment in patients with MODY3, we screened the HNF-1 alpha gene for mutations in Japanese subjects with IDDM. Ten exons and flanking introns of the HNF-1 alpha gene in these subjects were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing of the products. Mutations were identified in three (5.5%) of the 55 unrelated subjects with IDDM. A missense mutation of R272H (replacement of Arg by His in codon 272) in the DNA binding domain of HNF-1 alpha was found in a subject who developed IDDM 1 year after diagnosis of NIDDM at 8 years of age. A frameshift mutation of P291 fsinsC (insertion of a C in a polyC tract around codon 291 for Pro), which would generate a mutant truncated protein of 340 amino acids, was found in a subject who started insulin treatment when hyperglycemia and ketonuria were noticed at 13 years of age. A missense mutation of R583G (replacement of Arg by Gly in codon 583) in the transactivation domain of HNF-1 alpha was found in a subject with sudden-onset IDDM at 20 years of age. None of these mutations were present in 100 nondiabetic subjects (200 normal chromosomes). These results indicate that the HNF-1 alpha gene defects could lead to the development of not only early-onset NIDDM but also IDDM, implicating the importance of subclassification of HNF-1 alpha-deficient IDDM from a classical type of autoimmune-based IDDM in Japanese. ;polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
5955;10692581;Characterization of the nuclear transport of a novel leucine-rich acidic nuclear protein-like protein.;We previously reported that the nuclear localization signal (NLS) peptides stimulate the in vitro phosphorylation of several proteins, including a 34 kDa protein. In this study, we show that this specific 34 kDa protein is a novel murine leucine-rich acidic nuclear protein (LANP)-like large protein (mLANP-L). mLANP-L was found to have a basic type NLS. The co-injection of Q69LRan-GTP or SV40 T-antigen NLS peptides prevented the nuclear import of mLANP-L. mLANP-L NLS bound preferentially to Rch1 and NPI-1, but not to the Qip1 subfamily of importin alpha.

5958;24654904;Complex regional pain syndrome: more than a peripheral disease.;SUMMARY At early stages, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is clinically characterized by damage of peripheral tissues and nerves (edema, activation of osteoblasts, hyperalgesia to blunt pressure). These signs are the result of a dysbalance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, which normalizes approximately 6 months after the beginning of the disease, independent from clinical outcome. At the same time, evolving clinical signs such as allodynia, cold hyperalgesia, reduced tactile acuity or symptoms of disrupted body representation (e.g., neglect-like syndrome, impaired hand laterality recognition or shift of the body midline) suggest a crucial role of the CNS in the pathophysiology of this pain syndrome. Imaging studies have found a severe but reversible reduction of the cortical hand representation (primary and secondary somatosensory cortices and primary motor cortices). Interestingly however, complex multisensory integration in central association areas are unaffected in CRPS, as patients are capable of integrating artificial body parts or recognize 2D forms despite tactile dysfunction. Furthermore, despite its unilateral clinical manifestation, it has been shown that in CRPS but not in other unilateral neuropathic pain syndromes, alterations in cortical excitability occur bilaterally, both in sensory and motor regions. In conclusion, a more widespread and bilateral pattern of CNS reorganization appears to characterize CRPS, which might be related to dysfunctions in the basal ganglia or in thalamo-cortical structures. Consequently, CRPS treatment should involve not only anti-inflammatory measures and pain therapy, but also the integration of neurorehabilitative training programs.;-;-;-;hard_0

5970;35192551;Rubicon promotes rather than restricts murine lupus and is not required for LC3-associated phagocytosis.;NADPH oxidase deficiency exacerbates lupus in murine models and patients, but the mechanisms remain unknown. It is hypothesized that NADPH oxidase suppresses autoimmunity by facilitating dead cell clearance via LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP). The absence of LAP reportedly causes an autoinflammatory syndrome in aged, nonautoimmune mice. Prior work implicated cytochrome b-245, β polypeptide (CYBB), a component of the NADPH oxidase complex, and the RUN and cysteine-rich domain-containing Beclin 1-interacting protein (RUBICON) as requisite for LAP. To test the hypothesis that NADPH oxidase deficiency exacerbates lupus via a defect in LAP, we deleted Rubicon in the B6.Sle1.Yaa and MRL.Faslpr lupus mouse models. Under this hypothesis, RUBICON deficiency should phenocopy NADPH oxidase deficiency, as both work in the same pathway. However, we observed the opposite - RUBICON deficiency resulted in reduced mortality, renal disease, and autoantibody titers to RNA-associated autoantigens. Given that our data contradict the published role for LAP in autoimmunity, we assessed whether CYBB and RUBICON are requisite for LAP. We found that LAP is not dependent on either of these 2 pathways. To our knowledge, our data reveal RUBICON as a novel regulator of SLE, possibly by a B cell-intrinsic mechanism, but do not support a role for LAP in lupus.;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
5971;2010091;Analysis of the DNA-binding and activation properties of the human transcription factor AP-2.;The mammalian transcription factor AP-2 is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein expressed in neural crest lineages and regulated by retinoic acid. Here we report a structure/function analysis of the DNA-binding and transcription activation properties of the AP-2 protein. DNA contact studies indicate that AP-2 binds as a dimer to a palindromic recognition sequence. Furthermore, cross-linking and immunoprecipitation data illustrate that AP-2 exists as a dimer even in the absence of DNA. Examination of cDNA mutants reveals that the sequences responsible for DNA binding are located in the carboxy-terminal half of the protein. In addition, a domain mediating dimerization forms an integral component of this DNA-binding structure. Expression of AP-2 in mammalian cells demonstrates that transcriptional activation requires an additional amino-terminal domain that contains an unusually high concentration of proline residues. This proline-rich activation domain also functions when attached to the heterologous DNA-binding region of the GAL4 protein. This study reveals that although AP-2 shares an underlying modular organization with other transcription factors, the regions of AP-2 involved in transcriptional activation and DNA binding/dimerization have novel sequence characteristics. ;polyproline;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
5974;8524317;p95vav associates with the nuclear protein Ku-70.;The proto-oncogene vav is expressed solely in hematopoietic cells and plays an important role in cell signaling, although little is known about the proteins involved in these pathways. To gain further information, the Src homology 2 (SH2) and 3 (SH3) domains of Vav were used to screen a lymphoid cell cDNA library by the yeast two-hybrid system. Among the positive clones, we detected a nuclear protein, Ku-70, which is the DNA-binding element of the DNA-dependent protein kinase. In Jurkat and UT7 cells, Vav is partially localized in the nuclei, as judged from immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy studies. By using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins derived from Ku-70 and coimmunoprecipitation experiments with lysates prepared from human thymocytes and Jurkat and UT7 cells, we show that Vav associates with Ku-70. The interaction of Vav with Ku-70 requires only the 150-residue carboxy-terminal portion of Ku-70, which binds to the 25 carboxy-terminal residues of the carboxy SH3 domain of Vav. A proline-to-leucine mutation in the carboxy SH3 of Vav that blocks interaction with proline-rich sequences does not modify the binding of Ku-70, which lacks this motif. Therefore, the interaction of Vav with Ku-70 may be a novel form of protein-protein interaction. The potential role of Vav/Ku-70 complexes is discussed.;polyproline;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
5976;28782243;The La and related RNA-binding proteins (LARPs): structures, functions, and evolving perspectives.;La was first identified as a polypeptide component of ribonucleic protein complexes targeted by antibodies in autoimmune patients and is now known to be a eukaryote cell-ubiquitous protein. Structure and function studies have shown that La binds to a common terminal motif, UUU-3'-OH, of nascent RNA polymerase III (RNAP III) transcripts and protects them from exonucleolytic decay. For precursor-tRNAs, the most diverse and abundant of these transcripts, La also functions as an RNA chaperone that helps to prevent their misfolding. Related to this, we review evidence that suggests that La and its link to RNAP III were significant in the great expansions of the tRNAomes that occurred in eukaryotes. Four families of La-related proteins (LARPs) emerged during eukaryotic evolution with specialized functions. We provide an overview of the high-resolution structural biology of La and LARPs. LARP7 family members most closely resemble La but function with a single RNAP III nuclear transcript, 7SK, or telomerase RNA. A cytoplasmic isoform of La protein as well as LARPs 6, 4, and 1 function in mRNA metabolism and translation in distinct but similar ways, sometimes with the poly(A)-binding protein, and in some cases by direct binding to poly(A)-RNA. New structures of LARP domains, some complexed with RNA, provide novel insights into the functional versatility of these proteins. We also consider LARPs in relation to ancestral La protein and potential retention of links to specific RNA-related pathways. One such link may be tRNA surveillance and codon usage by LARP-associated mRNAs.

5977;9724541;TNP-ATP and TNP-ADP as probes of the nucleotide binding site of CheA, the histidine protein kinase in the chemotaxis signal transduction pathway of Escherichia coli.;The interaction of CheA with ATP has important consequences in the chemotaxis signal transduction pathway of Escherichia coli. This interaction results in autophosphorylation of CheA, a histidine protein kinase. Autophosphorylation of CheA sets in motion a chain of biochemical events that enables the chemotaxis receptor proteins to communicate with the flagellar motors. As a result of this communication, CheA allows the receptors to control the cell swimming pattern in response to gradients of attractant and repellent chemicals. To probe CheA interactions with ATP, we investigated the interaction of CheA with the fluorescent nucleotide analogues TNP-ATP [2'(3')-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5'-triphosphate] and TNP-ADP. Spectroscopic studies indicated that CheA bound TNP-ATP and TNP-ADP with high affinity (micromolar Kd values) and caused a marked enhancement of the fluorescence of the TNP moiety of these modified nucleotides. Analysis of titration experiments indicated a binding stoichiometry of two molecules of TNP-ATP (TNP-ADP) per CheA dimer and suggested that the two binding sites on the CheA dimer operate independently. Binding of TNP-ATP to CheA was inhibited by ATP, and analysis of this inhibition indicated that the CheA dimer binds 2 molecules of ATP. Competition experiments also indicated that CheA binds TNP-ATP considerably more tightly than it binds unmodified ATP. Binding of TNP-ADP to CheA was inhibited by ADP in a similar manner. TNP-ATP was not a substrate for CheA and served as a potent inhibitor of CheA autophosphorylation (Ki < 1 microM). The glycine-rich regions (G1 and G2) of CheA and other histidine protein kinases have been presumed to play important roles in ATP binding and/or catalysis of CheA autophosphorylation, although few experimental tests of these functional assignments have been made. Here, we demonstrate that a CheA mutant protein with Gly-->Ala substitutions in G1 and G2 has a markedly reduced affinity for ATP and ADP, as measured by Hummel-Dreyer chromatography. This mutant protein also bound TNP-ATP and TNP-ADP very poorly and had no detectable autokinase activity. Surprisingly, a distinct single-site substitution in G2 (Gly470-->Lys) had no observable effect on the affinity of CheA for ATP and ADP, despite the fact that it rendered CheA completely inactive as an autokinase. This mutant protein also bound TNP-ATP and TNP-ADP with affinities and stoichiometries that were indistinguishable from those observed with wild-type CheA. These results provide some preliminary insight into the possible functional roles of G1 and G2, and they suggest that TNP-nucleotides are useful tools for exploring the effects of additional mutations on the active site of CheA.; polyglycine ;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
5980;21969378;Alternative splicing produces Nanog protein variants with different capacities for self-renewal and pluripotency in embryonic stem cells.;Embryonic stem (ES) cells are distinguished by their ability to undergo unlimited self-renewal although retaining pluripotency, the capacity to specify cells of all germ layers. Alternative splicing contributes to these biological processes by vastly increasing the protein coding repertoire, enabling genes to code for novel variants that may confer different biological functions. The homeodomain transcription factor Nanog acts collaboratively with core factors Oct4 and Sox2 to govern the maintenance of pluripotency. We have discovered that Nanog is regulated by alternative splicing. Two novel exons and six subexons have been identified that extend the known Nanog gene structure and protein coding capacity. Alternative splicing results in two novel Nanog protein variants with attenuated capacities for self-renewal and pluripotency in ES cells. Our previous results have implicated the C-terminal domain, including the tryptophan-rich (WR) domain of Nanog, to be important for the function of Nanog (Wang, J., Levasseur, D. N., and Orkin, S. H. (2008) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 105, 6326-6331). Using point mutation analyses, serine 2 (Ser-2) of Nanog has been identified as critical for ES cell self-renewal and for stabilizing a pluripotent gene signature. An inducible conditional knock-out was created to test the ability of new Nanog variants to genetically complement Nanog null ES cells. These results reveal for the first time an expanded Nanog protein coding capacity. We further reveal that a short region of the N-terminal domain and a single phosphorylatable Ser-2 is essential for the maintenance of self-renewal and pluripotency, demonstrating that this region of the protein is highly regulated. ;polytryptophan;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

The recombinant plasmid was identified by restriction analysis and PCR. It was sequenced to confirm the correct sequences and the correct junctional orientations of the inserted N gene. The results of SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting revealed that the N protein was expressed in Escherichia coli LGM194 in a high level and the recombinant fusion protein, which contained a N-terminal HP-Thioredoxin and a C-terminal polyhistidine tag. It had a molecular mass of approximately 63.5 kD and immunologically reactive activity. The recombinant protein was characterized and tested in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) format for potential application in the serodiagnosis of vesicular stomatitis using 186 serum samples from experimentally infected goats and guinea-pigs with VSV-NJ and VSV-IN, and from field origin and reference serum samples. The sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA were compared with those of the standard microtiter serum neutralization (MTSN) tests. The ELISA and MTSN test results were highly correlated for detection of VSV antibodies. The ELISA was as sensitive as the SN assay in detecting positive serum to VSV. The correlation between SN titers and ELISA titers was statistically significant. These data suggest that the recombinant fusion N protein of VSV could be used as a recombinant test antigen for the serodiagnosis of vesicular stomatitis. The ELISA based on the reconmbinant nucleocapsid protein may offer the best combination of rapidity, sensitivity, simplicity, economy, and laboratory biosafety of any of the methods yet developed for VSV serodiagnosis. This study lay on foundation for the development of the diagnosis methods in serology for VSV. ;polyhistidine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

5985;7769661;Transactivation activity of Meq, a Marek's disease herpesvirus bZIP protein persistently expressed in latently infected transformed T cells.;Marek's disease virus (MDV) is an avian herpesvirus that induces a variety of diseases, including T-cell lymphomas, in chickens. In latently infected, transformed lymphoid cells, very few viral transcripts or proteins are detected. We previously described a gene, meq (MDV EcoQ), which is persistently expressed in MDV-transformed tumor samples and cell lines. meq codes for a 339-amino-acid protein with a basic-leucine zipper domain near its N terminus and a proline-rich domain near its C terminus. The basic-leucine zipper domain shows homology with Jun/Fos family proteins, whereas the proline-rich domain resembles that of the WT-1 tumor suppressor protein. These structural features raise the possibility that Meq functions as a transcription factor in regulating viral latency or oncogenesis. In this report, we show that the proline-rich domain is a potent transcription activator when fused to the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) Gal4(1-147) DNA-binding domain. The transactivation activity maps to the C-terminal 130 amino acids, with the last 33 amino acids essential. In the absence of these 33 amino acids, a two-and-one-half proline-rich repeat structure was found to exhibit repression activity. We further show that Meq is able to dimerize not only with itself but also with c-Jun. Meq/c-Jun heterodimers bind to an AP1-like sequence in the meq promoter region with an affinity much greater than that of Meq/Meq or c-Jun/c-Jun homodimers. Cotransfection chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays suggest that the Meq/c-Jun heterodimers can up-regulate Meq expression in both chicken embryo fibroblasts and F9 cells. Our data provide the first biochemical evidence that Meq is a transcriptional factor and identify c-Jun as one of Meq's interacting partners.;polyproline;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

5988;8198530;Localized chemical reactivity in DNA associated with the sequence-specific bisintercalation of echinomycin.;Four complementary footprinting and probing techniques utilizing DNAse I, methidiumpropyl EDTA (MPE).FeII, diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) and KMnO4 as DNA-cleaving or DNA-modifying agents have been applied to investigate the sequence-specific binding to DNA of the antitumour antibiotic echinomycin. A 265 bp EcoRI-PvuII DNA restriction fragment excised from plasmid pBS was used as a substrate. Six regions of protection against DNAase I cleavage were located on the 265-mer: three sites encompass the sequences 5'-TCGA or 5'-GCGT and the three others contain 5'-GpG (CpC) dinucleotide sequences where the inhibition of DNAase I cutting by echinomycin is less pronounced. In contrast, MPE.FeII cleavage allows identification of only three echinomycin-binding sites on the 265-mer: two sites contain the sequence 5'-TCGA and one encompasses the sequence 5'-ACCA. Cleavage of DNA by MPE.FeII in the presence of echinomycin remains practically unaffected at the sequence 5'-GCGT, despite its identification by DNAase I as a strong site for binding the antibiotic, as well as at the two other sequences containing GpG steps. With both DNAase I and MPE.FeII, enhanced DNA cleavage is evident at AT-rich sequences in the presence of echinomycin. Enhanced reactivity towards KMnO4 and DEPC provides clear evidence for sequence-dependent conformational changes in DNA induced by the antibiotic. The experiments reveal that KMnO4 reacts most strongly with thymines located around, but not necessarily adjacent to, an echinomycin-binding site, whereas the carbethoxylation reactions caused by DEPC occur primarily at the adenine residues lying immediately 5' or 3' to the dinucleotide that denotes an echinomycin-binding site. The results reported here demonstrate that DEPC and KMnO4 serve as sensitive probes for different states of the DNA helix. It seems that the reaction with KMnO4 involves transient unstacking events, whereas the carbethoxylation reaction of DEPC requires larger-scale helix opening. ;polythreonine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
5996;6654863;(2'-5')Oligoadenylate synthetase in pig spleen: isolation and characterization.;"A high level of activity of (2'-5')oligoadenylate synthetase (2-5A synthetase) was detected in pig spleens not treated with exogenous interferon. The enzyme recovered from homogenates of pig spleens was partially purified by the use of a combination of ion exchange gels (DEAE-Sephadex and CM-Sepharose) and affinity gels (2',5'-ADP-Sepharose and poly(I):poly(C)-agarose). The specific activity of the final sample was 32,800 nmol AMP polymerized/h/mg protein at 33 degrees C, and the enzyme was able to convert over 80% of ATP into 2-5A after a 24-h incubation; penta-adenylate was the major product (41% of total product). The 2-5A synthetase obtained was eluted from Sephacryl S-200 at around the position of a protein with Mr = 100,000. By using the purified 2-5A synthetase from pig spleens as an antigen, rabbit antiserum to this enzyme was prepared. The antibody bound to protein A-Sepharose absorbed the activity of 2-5A synthetase induced by interferon in pig cells. This result shows that the IFN-induced 2-5A synthetase shares antigenic determinants with the synthetase in spleens. Neither human nor mouse 2-5A synthetase combined with the antibody to porcine 2-5A synthetase. Thus, the antigenic structure of this enzyme is different from species to species.

6000;8972229;Molecular cloning and characterization of a transcription factor for the copia retrotransposon with homology to the BTB-containing lola neurogenic factor.;"By transfection experiments, we previously identified a 72-bp enhancer sequence within the Drosophila copia retrotransposon which is involved in the control of the transcription level of this mobile element in cells in culture. Gel shift assays with nuclear extracts from Drosophila hydei-derived DH-33 cells further demonstrated specific interactions of at least two nuclear factors with this enhancer sequence. Using this sequence as a probe for the screening of an expression cDNA library that we constructed from DH-33 cells RNA, we have isolated a cDNA clone encoding a 110-kDa protein with features common to those of known transcription factors; these include a two-zinc-finger motif at the C terminus, three glutamine-rich domains in the presumptive activation domain of the protein, and an N-terminal domain which shares homology with the Bric-à-brac, Tramtrack, and Broad-Complex BTB boxes. The precise DNA recognition sequence for this transcription factor has been determined by both gel shift assays and footprinting experiments with a recombinant protein made in bacteria. The functionality of the cloned element was demonstrated upon transcriptional activation of copia reporter genes, as well as of a minimal promoter coupled with the identified target DNA sequence, in cotransfection assays in cells in culture with an expression vector for the cloned factor. Southern blot and nucleotide sequence analyses revealed a related gene in Drosophila melanogaster (the lola gene) previously identified by a genetic approach as involved in axon growth and guidance. Transfection assays in cells in culture with lola gene expression vectors and in situ hybridization experiments with lola gene mutants finally provided evidence that the copia retrotransposon is regulated by this neurogenic gene in D.melanogaster, with a repressor effect in the central nervous systems of the embryos.";polyglutamine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
6002;11128969;Relationship between visual acuity and eye position variability during foveations in congenital nystagmus.;Visual acuity in congenital nystagmus has proven to be primarily related to the duration of foveation periods, during which the image of a target falls onto the fovea and eye velocity slows down. It was found that the longer the foveation time the higher the visual acuity. However, the cycle-to-cycle variability of the eye position and velocity during foveation periods also contribute to visual acuity. A high variability of the eye position during the foveations hinders a stable placement of the target image on the centralmost fovea and consequently decreases visual acuity. To investigate the relationship between different nystagmus features and visual acuity, infrared- oculographic and electro-oculographic eye position recordings of 20 patients affected by congenital nystagmus were analysed in different gaze positions. In several patients' recordings, a high variability of the eye position during foveations (i.e. greater than 0.5 degrees) was detected. Correspondingly, low visual acuity was measured, in spite of sufficiently long foveation periods. The standard deviation of eye positions during foveation periods was used to measure this variability and it was found to be correlated to visual acuity, in conjunction with the mean duration of the foveation periods. On the basis of the data analysis, an exponential relationship is proposed to relate visual acuity and the standard deviation of the eye position during foveations.;-;-;-;hard_0
6005;9679654;Characterization of a novel DNA binding domain within the amino-terminal region of the RAG-1 protein.;Rag-1 and Rag-2 are the critical components of the V-(D)-J recombinase required for site-specific recombination of the antigen receptor genes. In this study, we have examined the ability of recombinant (r) Rag-1 and Rag-2 to bind the recombination signal sequences (RSS) and have determined that rRag-1, but not rRag-2, is able to directly bind DNA. rRAG-1 DNA binding activity was found to reside within a novel amino-terminal arginine-rich (RR) domain with partial homology to a variety of nucleic acid binding domains. Although the RR-domain did not demonstrate RSS-specificity, this DNA binding domain may stabilize the interaction of RAG-1 with, or increase the affinity for, the V-(D)-J recombination signals. ;polyarginine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
6009;1656070;Promoter-specific transactivation of hepatitis B virus transcription by a glutamine- and proline-rich domain of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1.;The cloned transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1) transactivates transcription from the hepatitis B virus (HBV) large surface antigen promoter but does not influence the transcriptional activities of the other three HBV promoters. This indicates that this transcription factor can differentially influence the activities of the HBV promoter. By using a transient-transfection system, the major domain of the HNF1 polypeptide involved in transcriptional activation of the large surface antigen promoter in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2.1 has been mapped to a region that is rich in glutamine and proline residues (9 of 18) and is different from the previously identified regions of this factor responsible for in vitro transcriptional activation of a promoter containing human albumin promoter HNF1 binding sites. The human albumin promoter HNF1 binding site mediates transcriptional activation through the same HNF1 polypeptide domain as the HBV large surface antigen promoter HNF1 binding site in transient-transfection assays with HepG2.1 cells, suggesting that HNF1 may possess multiple transcriptional activation domains. ;polyproline;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

After treatment for one week with 4 X 10 mg nifedipine daily and 3 X 200 mg cimetidine daily and 400 mg at night plasma level peaks of nifedipine averaged 87.7 +/- 19.1 ng/ml, while after 4 X 10 mg nifedipine alone they were only 46.1 +/- 10.6 ng/ml. Ranitidine produced an approximately 25%, nonsignificant, rise in plasma level-time curve and peak plasma levels of nifedipine. Seven hypertensives (WHO stage I and II) had a mean arterial blood pressure level of 127 +/- 2.5 mm Hg after two-week placebo administration, and of 109 +/- 2.38 mm Hg after four weeks of nifedipine alone at 4 X 10 mg daily (P less than 0.01). After additional administration of 1 g cimetidine daily for two weeks the mean blood pressure fell significantly to 95 +/- 3.1 mm Hg (P = 0.02), while blood pressure fell to 103 +/- 3.88 mm Hg after two weeks of additional administration of 300 mg ranitidine daily, a fall which was not significant (P greater than 0.05).

The high levels of body dissatisfaction and abnormal eating attitudes currently prevalent in Western societies have been attributed by many authors to the promotion of an unrealistically thin ideal for women. We investigated the role of the visual media by examining the relationship between body image dissatisfaction and eating attitudes in visually impaired women.


METHOD
Questionnaires were administered to 60 women, 20 congenitally blind, 20 blinded later in life, and 20 sighted.


RESULTS
Congenitally blind women had lower body dissatisfaction scores and more positive eating attitudes compared to women blinded later in life and sighted women, the latter having the highest body dissatisfaction scores and the most negative eating attitudes. Scores from sighted women were positively correlated with each other.

The results suggest the importance of the visual media in promoting unrealistic images of thinness and beauty and are discussed from a sociocultural perspective.";-;-;-;hard_0
6013;9129154;ESX: a structurally unique Ets overexpressed early during human breast tumorigenesis.;The >30 known members of the Ets multigene family of transcriptional regulators are increasingly being recognized for their involvement in early embryonic development and late tissue maturation, directing stage-specific and tissue-restricted programs of target gene expression. Identifiable primarily by their 85 amino acid ETS DNA-binding domain and dispersed across all metazoan lineages into distinct subfamilies, Ets genes also produce malignancies in humans and other vertebrates when overexpressed or rearranged into chimeras retaining the ETS domain, suggesting that their oncogenic potential is determined by the program of target genes they regulate. Searching for Ets factors that regulate expression of the HER2/neu (c-erbB2) oncogene in human breast cancer, we identified a new epithelium-restricted Ets encoding an ETS domain homologous to the Drosophila E74/human Elf-1 subfamily, an amino-terminal region (A-region or Pointed domain) homologous to the distantly related Ets-1 subfamily, and a serine-rich box homologous to the transactivating domain of the lymphocyte-restricted High Mobility Group (HMG) protein, SOX4. Recombinant protein encoded by ESX (for epithelial-restricted with serine box) exhibits Ets-like DNA binding specificity in electrophoretic mobility shift assays and, in transient transfection assays, transactivates Ets-responsive promoter elements including that found in the HER2/neu oncogene. ESX is located at chromosome 1q32 in a region known to be amplified in 50% of early breast cancers, is heregulin-inducible and overexpressed in HER2/neu activated breast cancer cells. Tissue hybridization suggests that ESX becomes overexpressed at an early stage of human breast cancer development known as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). ;polyserine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
6014;9832660;Effect of visual cues, vital signs, and protocols on triage: a prospective randomized crossover trial.;"STUDY OBJECTIVES
We sought to compare triage designations derived from in-person and telephone interviews and systematically examine the effect of visual cues, vital signs, and complaint-based protocols on the triage process.


METHODS
We conducted a 2-phase, prospective, observational study employing a randomized, crossover design in a university teaching hospital emergency department. In both phases, every eligible patient underwent sequential in-person and telephone triage interviews conducted by certified ED triage nurses. After taking a history, each nurse chose 1 of 5 hypothetical triage designations and, after being told the patient's vital signs, again selected a designation. Phase 1 designations were based solely on nurses' clinical expertise. In phase 2, both nurses used complaint-based protocols.


RESULTS
Agreement between telephone and in-person designations was poor (percent agreement, 43.1% to 48.8%; kappa,.19 to.26; taub,.34 to.45 for the 4 primary comparisons). Knowledge of vital signs and use of protocols did not improve agreement or increase identification of patients requiring admission to hospital.


CONCLUSION
These data establish that telephone and in-person triage are not equivalent and suggest that visual cues may play an important role in the triage process. It is unclear whether telephone triage is an adequate method of assigning patients to an appropriate level of care.";-;-;-;hard_0

The optimal dose of plasmid vaccine encoding full-length Ag2/PRA was determined to be between 10 and 100 microg. Mice vaccinated with plasmids encoding amino acids (aa) 1 to 106 were as protective as full-length Ag2/PRA (aa 1 to 194). The subunit from aa 27 to 106 was significantly but less protective. Plasmids encoding aa 90 to 151 or aa 90 to 194 were not protective. Analogous results were obtained with recombinant vaccines of the same amino acid sequences. In addition, mixtures of aa 90 to 194 with either aa 1 to 106 or aa 27 to 106 did not enhance protection compared to the active single-recombinant subunits alone. Humoral response of total immunoglobulin G (IgG) and subclasses IgG1 and IgG2a were detectable in subunit vaccinations but at significantly (100-fold) lower concentrations than after vaccination with plasmids encoding full-length Ag2/PRA. Since virtually all protection by vaccination with full-length Ag2/PRA can be accounted for in the first half of the protein (aa 1 to 106), this subunit could make a multicomponent vaccine more feasible by reducing the quantity of protein per dose and the possibility of an untoward reactions to a foreign protein. ;polyproline;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
6016;8626424;Developmental expression of a tandemly repeated, proline-and glutamine-rich amino acid motif on hyphal surfaces on Candida albicans.;cDNA sequences encoding a cell wall protein have been isolated from the opportunistic pathogen, Candida albicans, an organism that can cause serious disease in immunocompromised patients such as those with AIDS. The cDNA encodes a peptide that is largely composed of an acidic, repeated motif 10 amino acids in length that is rich in proline and glutamine residues. The cDNA gene product was found to be present on hyphal surfaces by immunofluorescence assays using monospecific antisera raised to the recombinant protein produced in Pichia pastoris. The hyphae-specific surface location was also seen on organisms colonizing the gastrointestinal mucosa of mice, indicating that the antigen is produced and developmentally regulated during growth in host tissues. The cDNA clone hybridized to an abundant messenger RNA 2.3 kilobases in size that was present in hyphal but not yeast forms. These studies demonstrate that the bud-hypha transition is accompanied by the de novo synthesis of proteins that are targeted to hyphal surfaces.

6018;9708576;mRNA encoding four isoforms of the plasma membrane calcium pump and their variants in rat kidney and nephron segments.;To survey the presence of the four different isoforms of the plasma membrane calcium pump (PMCA) and their alternative splicing variants in the rat kidney, three major zones (cortex, outer medulla, and inner medulla) were macrodissected and probed for the presence of mRNA encoding these isoforms and their variants at the splicing site C by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Both the cortex and the outer medulla showed PMCA 1b, 2b, 3(a and c), and 4b. Semiquantitative comparisons indicated that isoform 2b is more abundant in the cortex than in the outer medulla and conversely, that isoform 3 (a and c) is more abundant in the outer medulla than in the cortex. The inner medulla showed only mRNA for isoforms 1b and 4b. The nephron segments present in the cortex and outer medulla were microdissected and analyzed by RT-PCR. Isoforms 1b, 2b, and 4b were found in all nephron segments but were found more frequently in tubular segments with high rates of Ca2+ reabsorption, suggesting that these isoforms may be involved in transepithelial transport. On the other hand, mRNA encoding isoform 3 (a and c) was most abundant in descending thin limb of Henle but was detected also in glomeruli and cortical thin ascending limb. Its distinct localization suggests that this isoform might have another function, such as in intracellular signalling.;-;-;-;hard_0

These facilitatory cardio-respiratory responses were coupled with powerful contractions of the urinary bladder wall. By contrast, mucosal application of the chemicals did not bring about any significant change. The cardio-respiratory responses obtained were completely abolished on serosal application of procaine (1%), section of the hypogastric nerves or by spinalectomy at T8.

6022;11312261;Positive and negative regulation of myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells by isoforms of the multiple homeodomain zinc finger transcription factor ATBF1.;The ATBF1 gene encodes two protein isoforms, the 404-kDa ATBF1-A, possessing four homeodomains and 23 zinc fingers, and the 306-kDa ATBF1-B, lacking a 920-amino acid N-terminal region of ATBF1-A which contains 5 zinc fingers. In vitro, ATBF1-A was expressed in proliferating C2C12 myoblasts, but its expression levels decreased upon induction of myogenic differentiation in low serum medium. Forced expression of ATBF1-A in C2C12 cells resulted in repression of MyoD and myogenin expression and elevation of Id3 and cyclin D1 expression, leading to inhibition of myogenic differentiation in low serum. In contrast, transfection of C2C12 cells with the ATBF1-B isoform led to an acceleration of myogenic differentiation, as indicated by an earlier onset of myosin heavy chain expression and formation of a higher percentage of multinucleated myotubes. The fourth homeodomain of ATBF1-A bound to an AT-rich element adjacent to the E1 E-box of the muscle regulatory factor 4 promoter mediating transcriptional repression. The ATBF1-A-specific N-terminal region possesses general transcription repressor activity. These results suggest that ATBF1-A plays a role in the maintenance of the undifferentiated myoblast state, and its down-regulation is a prerequisite to initiate terminal differentiation of C2C12 cells. ;polythreonine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function

We divided animals into three groups: MAb 1 group (n = 5)--rats were subjected to 2 hours of transient occlusion and 1B6c (1 mg/kg) was administered intravenously at 0 and 22 hours of reperfusion; MAb 2 group (n = 5)--same experimental protocol as MAb 1 group, except that the initial dose of 1B6c was increased to 2 mg/kg; and control group (n = 5)--same experimental protocol as MAb 2 group, except that an isotype-matched control antibody was administered.

6026;10085383;Water Level Effects on Growth of Melaleuca Seedlings from Lake Okeechobee (Florida, USA) Littoral Zone.;"/ The invasive exotic wetland tree, Melaleuca quinquenervia, is expanding rapidly throughout seasonally wet areas of southern Florida (USA), including the littoral zone of Lake Okeechobee. Natural resource managers are concerned that a lower lake level regulation schedule under consideration for Lake Okeechobee, while potentially beneficial to overall ecosystem health, might increase the rate of Melaleuca expansion. To investigate this possibility, Melaleuca saplings (harvested from the littoral zone) and 7-week-old seedlings (grown from harvested seeds) were subjected to various hydroperiod treatments in replicated mesocosms. Hydroperiod treatments were selected based on a simulation of historical water level variations. Saplings grew taller under longer hydroperiods with fluctuating water levels, including periods of submersion. Time since germination affected the response of seedlings to inundation. Submersed 7-week-old seedlings grew slower and had less biomass than submersed 12-week-old seedlings, yet mortality was low at both ages. Melaleuca's plasticity allows it to adapt to hypoxic, aquatic conditions by means of aquatic heterophylly and adventitious roots. Algae and drought also increased mortality. Based on faster growth of Melaleuca under longer hydroperiods and its adaptability to seasonal flooding, a lower lake regulation schedule may not stimulate its expansion. Therefore, water levels should not be manipulated only to control Melaleuca. Control of Melaleuca should continue using current practices such as manual removal or chemical treatment.

In addition, soluble B7 proteins, minus their transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, have been shown to block the down regulation of T-cell activation through blockade of B7/CTLA-4 interactions in mouse tumor models. Recently, we developed swinepox virus (SPV) vectors for delivery of feline leukemia antigens for vaccine use in cats [Winslow, B.J., Cochran, M.D., Holzenburg, A., Sun, J., Junker, D.E., Collisson, E.W., 2003. Replication and expression of a swinepox virus vector delivering feline leukemia virus Gag and Env to cell lines of swine and feline origin. Virus Res. 98, 1-15]. To explore the use of feline B7.1 and B7.2 ligands as nonchemical adjuvants, SPV vectors containing full-length feline B7.1 and B7.2 ligands were constructed and analyzed. Full-length feline B7.1 and B7.2 produced from SPV vectors were natively processed and costimulated Jurkat cells to produce IL-2, in vitro. In addition, we explored the feasibility of utilizing SPV as a novel expression vector to produce soluble forms of feline B7.1 (sB7.1) and B7.2 (sB7.2) in tissue culture. The transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of the B7.1 and B7.2 genes were replaced with a poly-histidine tag and purified via a two-step chromatography procedure. Receptor binding and costimulation activity was measured. Although feline sB7.1-his and sB7.2-his proteins bound to the human homolog receptors, CTLA-4 and CD28, both soluble ligands possessed greater affinity for CTLA-4, compared to CD28. However, both retained the ability to partially block CD28-mediated costimulation in vitro. Results from these studies establish the use of SPV as a mammalian expression vector and suggest that full-length-vectored and purified soluble feline B7 ligands may be valuable, nonchemical immune-modulators. ;polyhistidine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
6030;27907199;Identification, Heterologous Expression, and Functional Characterization of Bacillus subtilis YutF, a HAD Superfamily 5'-Nucleotidase with Broad Substrate Specificity.;5'-nucleotidases (EC 3.1.3.5) catalyze the hydrolytic dephosphorylation of 5'-ribonucleotides and 5'-deoxyribonucleotides as well as complex nucleotides, such as uridine 5'-diphosphoglucose (UDP-glucose), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide, to their corresponding nucleosides plus phosphate. These enzymes have been found in diverse species in intracellular and membrane-bound, surface-localized forms. Soluble forms of 5'-nucleotidases belong to the ubiquitous haloacid dehalogenase superfamily (HADSF) and have been shown to be involved in the regulation of nucleotide, nucleoside and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) pools. Despite the important role of 5'-nucleotidases in cellular metabolism, only a few of these enzymes have been characterized in the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, the workhorse industrial microorganism included in the Food and Drug Administration's GRAS (generally regarded as safe) list. In the present study, we report the identification of a novel 5'-nucleotidase gene from B. subtilis, yutF, which comprises 771 bp encoding a 256-amino-acid protein belonging to the IIA subfamily of the HADSF. The gene product is responsible for the major p-nitrophenyl phosphatase activity in B. subtilis. The yutF gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and its product fused to a polyhistidine tag was purified and biochemically characterized as a soluble 5'-nucleotidase with broad substrate specificity. The recombinant YutF protein was found to hydrolyze various purine and pyrimidine 5'-nucleotides, showing preference for 5'-nucleoside monophosphates and, specifically, 5'-XMP. Recombinant YutF also exhibited phosphohydrolase activity toward nucleotide precursors, ribose-5-phosphate and 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate. Determination of the kinetic parameters of the enzyme revealed a low substrate specificity (Km values in the mM concentration range) and modest catalytic efficiencies with respect to substrates. An initial study of the regulation of yutF expression showed that the yutF gene is a component of the yutDEF transcription unit and that YutF overproduction positively influences yutDEF expression. ;polyhistidine;phosphatase activity;-;LCR_with_function

Here we report a high-resolution (1.8 A) crystal structure of the A(3)VP(1) fragment of S. mutans AgI/II that demonstrates a unique fibrillar form (155 A) through the interaction of two noncontiguous regions in the primary sequence. The A(3) repeat of the alanine-rich domain adopts an extended alpha-helix that intertwines with the P(1) repeat polyproline type II (PPII) helix to form a highly extended stalk-like structure heretofore unseen in prokaryotic or eukaryotic protein structures. Velocity sedimentation studies indicate that full-length AgI/II that contains three A/P repeats extends over 50 nanometers in length. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that the high-affinity association between the A(3) and P(1) helices is enthalpically driven. Two distinct binding sites on AgI/II to the host receptor salivary agglutinin (SAG) were identified by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The current crystal structure reveals that AgI/II family proteins are extended fibrillar structures with the number of alanine- and proline-rich repeats determining their length. ;polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function

The health-care workers are known to be at risk of occupational transmission of blood-borne viruses. The goal of the investigation was to determine the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody and the occupational risk of HCV transmission among personnel at the Central. Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Budapest, Hungary. Serum samples of 409 health-care workers were tested for antibody to HCV with second and third generation ELISA-s and anti-HCV positive samples were confirmed with Western Blot Line EIA. A total of 10 (2.4%) of the health-care workers were confirmed to be anti-HCV positive. The prevalence of anti-HCV increased with advancing age: zero under 20 yr age group (N = 0/15), 0.9% in 21-30 yr age group (N = 1/112), 1.8% in 31-40 yr age group (N = 2/111), 3.1% in 41-50 yr age group (N = 3/96) and 4.0% in above 50 yr age group (N = 3/75). We found anti-HCV positive hospital worker in 9 out of 17 departments. The prevalence of hepatitis C antibody was 7.1-1.9% among the personnel of internal departments, pathology, intensive care unit and pediatric departments. No anti-HCV positive health-care worker was found in the surgery and laboratories. None of the physicians tested was seropositive for HCV. Eight of the nurses, one of the sanitary personnel and one pathological technician were seropositive for HCV. Two nurses developed a chronic C hepatitis after a needlestick accident.


CONCLUSIONS
1. The hospital personnel is at risk for HCV infection. 2. The occupational risk of HCV infection increases with age but the risk is considerable lower than that of hepatitis B infection. 3. The occupational risk is highest among the workers of the chronic internal department, pathology and intensive care unit. 4. The nurses are at higher risk of HCV infection than the physicians. 5. The needlestick injury is associated with an increased risk for acquiring HCV infection.";-;-;-;hard_0
6033;9735210;Fractal Aggregates of Polydisperse Particles.;In this work we examine structural effects of particle polydispersity on fractal aggregates by performing DLCA simulations with multiple primary particle sizes. We show that the fractal structure and the form of the cutoff function that describes the gross shape of the aggregates is unaffected by the details of the primary particle size distribution. The scattering behavior is evaluated in terms of partial structure factors, and depending on the details of primary particle size distribution and contrast, the scattering curve can deviate significantly from the typical q-Df behavior at the high q end of the spectrum. We also develop an expression for average primary particle size that allows the calculation of aggregate solid volume fraction for fractal aggregates with polydisperse primary particles.

6034;7582021;Agrobacterium radiobacter and related organisms take up fructose via a binding-protein-dependent active-transport system.;"Washed cells of Agrobacterium radiobacter prepared from a fructose-limited continuous culture (D 0.045 h-1) transported D(-)[U-14C]fructose in a linear manner for up to 4 min at a rate several-fold higher than the rate of fructose utilization by the growing culture. D(-)[U-14C]Fructose transport exhibited a high affinity for fructose (KT < 1 microM) and was inhibited to varying extents by osmotic shock, by the uncoupling agent carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, and by unlabelled sugars (D-fructose/D-mannose > D-ribose > D-sorbose > D-glucose/D-galactose/D-xylose; no inhibition by D-arabinose). Prolonged growth of A. radiobacter in fructose-limited continuous culture led to the selection of a novel strain (AR100) which overproduced a fructose-binding protein (FBP) and showed an increased rate of fructose transport. FBP was purified from osmotic-shock fluid using anion-exchange fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). The monomeric protein (M(r) 34,200 by SDS-PAGE and 37,700 by gel-filtration FPLC) bound D-[U-14C]-fructose stoichiometrically (1.17 nmol nmol FBP-1) and with high affinity (KD 0.49 microM) as shown by equilibrium dialysis. Binding of D-[U-14C]fructose by FBP was variably inhibited by unlabelled sugars (D-fructose/D-mannose > D-ribose > D-sorbose; no inhibition by D-glucose, D-galactose or D-arabinose). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of FBP (ADTSVCLI-) was similar to that of several sugar-binding proteins from other species of bacteria. Fructose transport and FBP were variably induced in batch cultures of A. radiobacter by growth on different carbon sources (D-fructose > D-ribose/D-mannose > D-glucose; no induction by succinate). An immunologically similar protein to FBP was produced by Agrobacterium tumefaciens and various species of Rhizobium following growth on fructose. It is concluded that fructose is transported into A. radiobacter and related organisms via a periplasmic fructose/mannose-binding-protein-dependent active-transport system, in contrast to the phosphotransferase system used by many other species of bacteria.";-;-;-;hard_0

6039;1385456;Monoclonal antibodies identify a possible regulatory domain of MyoD1.;A panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to murine MyoD1 was generated. One set of mAbs is shown to react with epitope(s) in the cysteine/histidine-rich (C/H) region while another set is shown to react with epitope(s) in the C-terminal portion of MyoD1. One of the mAbs reactive with a C-terminal epitope sensitively detected MyoD1 in whole cell extracts by Western blotting. Time course studies of total protein accumulation during C2C12 myoblast differentiation revealed only subtle changes in the phosphorylation and quantity of MyoD1 protein present in C2C12 cells from induction to 120 hr after induction. These results suggest that modulation of MyoD1 protein or total phosphorylation levels is not tightly associated with the transition of undifferentiated myoblasts to differentiated myocytes. Monoclonal antibodies to the C-terminal epitope produced supershifted bands in gel retardation assays, indicating that these mAbs had no effect on DNA binding. Although the C/H region of MyoD1 does not participate in DNA binding, mAbs reactive with the C/H region neutralized this activity in gel retardation assays. These data suggest that the conserved C/H domain may serve to modulate MyoD1 DNA-binding activity by interacting with another regulator.;polyhistidine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
6041;9240301;Heparin coating of extracorporeal circuits inhibits contact activation during cardiac operations.;"OBJECTIVE
Heparin coating reduces complement activation on the surface of extracorporeal circuits. In this study we investigated its effect on activation of the contact system in 30 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with the use of a heparin-coated (Duraflo II, Baxter Healthcare Corp., Edwards Division, Santa Ana, Calif.; n = 15) or an uncoated extracorporeal circuit (n = 15).


METHODS
Plasma markers that reflect activation of contact (kallikrein-C1-inhibitor complexes), coagulation (prothrombin fragments F1 + 2), or fibrinolytic (plasmin-alpha 2-antiplasmin complexes) systems were determined before and during the operation. The generation of kallikrein-C1-inhibitor complexes was reduced by 62% (p = 0.06) after the onset of cardiopulmonary bypass and by 43% (p = 0.026) after the cessation of bypass in the group in which a heparin-coated circuit was used compared with the group in which the circuit was uncoated. Generation was reduced by 58% (p = 0.06) when the ratio of kallikrein-C1-inhibitor to prekallikrein after onset of bypass was considered. We detected significant increases in F1 + 2 levels in both groups and increases in plasmin-alpha 2-antiplasmin complexes in the heparin-coated group at cessation of bypass, but no intergroup differences were observed. Thus use of heparin-coated extracorporeal circuits during cardiac operations reduces formation of kallikrein-C1-inhibitor complexes when compared with use of uncoated circuits. The heparin coating is not accompanied by similar reductions in coagulation or fibrinolysis, suggesting that thrombin and plasmin formation during cardiopulmonary bypass occurs mainly independently of the contact system activation.";-;-;-;hard_0
6043;9306159;The changing role of village health volunteers in northeast Thailand: an ethnographic field study.;The system of Primary Health care (PHC) in Thailand is one of the oldest in the world and is known worldwide for its success. Supporting the concept of community involvement, the Village Health Volunteer (VHV) is the backbone of this health care delivery system. In December 1994, an ethnographic field study was conducted in a village in Northeast Thailand to explore the implementation and acceptance of the role of the VHV. The VHVs displayed appropriate knowledge of their role but reported decreased use of their services by residents due to the close proximity of the village to a major urban area where health services were readily available. The majority of the villagers who were interviewed did not know the VHVs in their community and few had used their services. They relied on self-treatment and self-referral for their health care concerns. With increasing urbanization of this once rural village, the VHV no longer serves as the point of entry into the health care system. While still a vital part of the PCH system, the role of the VHV will need to adapt to the changing needs of the community it serves.;-;-;-;hard_0
6044;9278474;The Elav-like proteins bind to AU-rich elements and to the poly(A) tail of mRNA.;The Elav-like proteins are specific mRNA binding proteins which are required for cellular differentiation. They contain three characteristic RNP2/RNP1-type RNA binding motifs. Previously we have shown that the first and second RNA binding domains bind to AU-rich elements in the 3'-UTR of mRNA. In this paper we show that the Elav-like proteins exhibit poly(A) binding activity. This activity is distinct from poly(A) binding activities that have been previously described. The Elav-like proteins specifically bind to long chain poly(A) tails. We have shown that the third RNA binding domain encompasses this poly(A) binding activity.

We show that it is possible to generate single-copy integration events with high efficiency by restriction enzyme-mediated integration (REMI). In about 50% of cases, a plasmid that contains a single BamHI site is integrated at chromosomal BamH1 sites, if BamHI is added to the transformation mixtures. In the other cases it appears that integration events have also occurred preferentially at BamHI sites, but without restoration of the recognition sites. Using REMI we have generated approximately 1000 insertion mutants. Pathogenicity tests demonstrated that about 1-2% of these mutants were unable to induce symptoms when tested in planta. For two of the mutants we have shown that the phenotype is linked to the insertion event.;-;-;-;hard_0

6053;12627977;HU binding to bent DNA: a fluorescence resonance energy transfer and anisotropy study.;HU, an architectural DNA-binding protein, either stabilizes DNA in a bent conformation or induces a bend upon binding to give other proteins access to the DNA. In this study, HU binding affinity for a bent DNA sequence relative to a linear sequence was investigated using fluorescence anisotropy measurements. A static bend was achieved by the introduction of two phased A4T4 tracts in a 20 bp duplex. Binding affinity for 20 bp duplexes containing two phased A-tracts in either a 5'-3' or 3'-5' orientation was found to be almost 10-fold higher than HU binding to a random sequence 20 bp duplex (6.1 vs 0.68 microM(-1)). The fluorescence technique of resonance energy transfer was used to quantitatively determine the static bend of the DNA duplexes and the HU-induced bend. DNA molecules were 5'-end labeled with fluorescein as the donor or rhodamine as the acceptor. From the efficiency of energy transfer, the end-to-end distance of the DNA duplexes was calculated. The end-to-end distance relative to DNA contour length (R/R(C)) yields a bend angle for the A-tract duplex of 45 +/- 7 degrees in the absence of HU and 70 +/- 3 degrees in the presence of HU. The bend angle calculated for the T4A4 tract duplex was 62 +/- 4 degrees after binding two HU dimers. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements reveal that HU binds in a 1:1 stoichiometry to the A4T4 tract duplex but a 2:1 stoichiometry to the T4A4 tract and random sequence duplex. These findings suggest that HU binding and recognition of DNA may be governed by a structural mechanism. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
6059;23335637;HnRNPH1/H2, U1 snRNP, and U11 snRNP cooperate to regulate the stability of the U11-48K pre-mRNA.;Alternative splicing (AS) is a major contributor to proteome diversity, but it also regulates gene expression by introducing premature termination codons (PTCs) that destabilize transcripts, typically via the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway. Such AS events often take place within long, conserved sequence elements, particularly in genes encoding various RNA binding proteins. AS-NMD is often activated by the protein encoded by the same gene, leading to a self-regulating feedback loop that maintains constant protein levels. However, cross-regulation between different RNA binding proteins is also common, giving rise to finely tuned regulatory networks. Recently, we described a feedback mechanism regulating two protein components of the U12-dependent spliceosome (U11-48K and U11/U12-65K) through a highly conserved sequence element. These elements contain a U11 snRNP-binding splicing enhancer (USSE), which, through the U11 snRNP, activates an upstream U2-type 3'ss, resulting in the degradation of the U11-48K mRNA by AS-NMD. Through phylogenetic analysis, we now identify a G-rich sequence element that is conserved in fishes as well as mammals. We show that this element binds hnRNPF/H proteins in vitro. Knockdown of hnRNPH1/H2 or mutations in the G-run both lead to enhanced activation of the 3'ss in vivo, suggesting that hnRNPH1/H2 proteins counteract the 3'ss activation. Furthermore, we provide evidence that U1 binding immediately downstream from the G-run similarly counteracts the U11-mediated activation of the alternative 3'ss. Thus, our results elucidate the mechanism in which snRNPs from both spliceosomes together with hnRNPH1/H2 proteins regulate the recognition and activation of the highly conserved alternative splice sites within the U11-48K pre-mRNA. ;polyglycine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
6062;1993700;Conformational studies of the nucleic acid binding sites for Xenopus transcription factor IIIA.;The CD spectrum of a restriction fragment that contains a single copy of a Xenopus borealis somatic 5 S rRNA gene, like those of two smaller fragments from the binding site for transcription factor IIIA (TFIIIA), is that of B-form DNA. Under dehydrating conditions (76% ethanol) the 5 S rDNA undergoes a transition into an A conformation. The spectra of the three fragments, however, do exhibit some perturbation in that the longwave positive peaks are shifted to shorter wavelengths and have enhanced rotational strength compared with reference B-form spectra. The helical repeats measured for the smaller fragments indicate that the helix winding angle can account for these features in the CD spectra. We suggest that G:C-rich boxes that punctuate not only the TFIIIA binding site but the whole 5 S gene are responsible for the conformational perturbation manifest in the CD spectra and may play a role in the recognition of the DNA by the factor. The spectrum of the gene is unchanged in the presence of TFIIIA, indicating that the structural heterogeneity of the DNA persists upon complex formation. The CD spectra of native TFIIIA.5 S rRNA particles isolated from oocytes and of particles reconstituted in vitro are identical and only moderately different from the spectrum of free 5 S rRNA, suggesting that the protein effects only limited changes in the secondary and/or tertiary structure of the RNA. The helical structure of the two binding sites is discussed with respect to a common mode of interaction of TFIIIA with DNA and RNA.;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

Those data evidences the need for new prevention strategies and prophylactic treatments. This prevention crisis occurred in spite of the knowledge and availability of efficient prevention strategies. The G2-S16 is a microbicidal polyanionic carbosilane dendrimer currently being tested for topical vaginal application, which has been shown to be efficient in the prevention of HIV-1 infection. However, safety tests were lacked. For this purpose, we injected intravenously G2-S16 dendrimer to CD1 mice, thereby analyzing the hemogram, blood biochemical markers of systemic damage, accumulation in the organs and organ-tissue damage in heart, spleen, kidney, liver and brain. This work shows that even if the G2-S16 dendrimer penetrates the epithelial tissue, it does not cause vaginal irritation or tissue damage. Moreover, the i.v. injection of the G2-S16 dendrimer did not cause a damaging effect on the studied organs and it did not modify the hemogram or the biochemical plasma markers. In conclusion, the G2-S16 dendrimer has a very good safety profile, indicating that this molecule can be a very safe and efficient vaginal microbicide.";-;-;-;hard_0

6066;7892247;Cell membrane formation during the cellularization of the syncytial blastoderm of Drosophila.;The early blastoderm of Drosophila is a syncytium in which about 6000 nuclei become localized in the peripheral cytoplasm. During cycle 14 interphase, a wave of membrane formation encircles each nucleus inside its own plasma membrane, thereby generating an intact epithelial layer. The details of this process of cellularization have been unclear. Using an improved method of fixation of the embryos for electron microscopy, we show by morphological observations that a large number of membrane-bounded, electron-transparent vesicles, of diameters ranging from 0.05 micron to 0.5 micron, are present in the periplasm and become redistributed during cellularization so as to provide the membrane mass required at each phase of the process. We recognize three phases. In the first two phases, the vesicles that were present in the apical periplasmic space at earlier stages become concentrated and aligned between the nuclei. The vesicles then undergo concerted but not precisely synchronous fusion to form double membranes, starting at furrows in the plasma membrane of the embryo and extending about 7 microns into the periplasmic space. Subsequently, in the third phase vesicles are recruited to the basal periplasmic space but do not become aligned between the nuclei as in the first phase. We presume that these vesicles fuse individually with the growing ends of the double membranes until encirclement of each nucleus is complete. We speculate that these vesicles are all derived from the Golgi apparatus and are moved about in the blastoderm by interactions with components of the cytoskeleton.;-;-;-;hard_0
6069;9192394;Location and effect of obesity on putative anorectic binding sites in the rat brain.;Anorectic drugs such as mazindol bind to a class of low-affinity, sodium-sensitive sites in the brain which are affected by ambient glucose concentrations and a predisposition to develop diet-induced obesity (DIO). This study used quantitative autoradiography of 10 nM 3H-mazindol binding to identify the cellular location of these putative anorectic binding sites in the brain and to assess the way in which the development of DIO affected their binding. We previously showed that chow-fed, obesity-prone rats have widespread increases in brain 3H-mazindol binding to these low-affinity sites as compared with diet-resistant (DR) rats. Here, low-affinity 3H-mazindol binding was assessed in the brains of eight rats which developed DIO vs. eight which were DR after three months on a high-energy diet. DIO rats gained 89% more weight and had 117% higher plasma insulin levels but no difference in plasma glucose levels compared with DR rats. Along with these differences, low-affinity 3H-mazindol binding in DIO rats was identical to that in DR rats in all of the 23 brain areas assessed. This suggested that this binding was downregulated by the development of obesity in DIO rats. In other chow-fed rats, stereotaxic injections of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine and 6-hydroxydopamine (6OHDA) to ablate serotonin and catecholamine nerve terminals in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMN) had no effect on 3H-mazindol binding. However, ibotenic acid injected into the VMN, substantia nigra, pars reticulata, and pars compacta destroyed intrinsic neurons and/or their local processes and decreased low-affinity 3H-mazindol binding by 13%-22%. Destruction of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra, pars compacta, and noradrenergic neurons in the locus ceruleus with 6OHDA also reduced 3H-mazindol binding in those areas by 9% and 12%, respectively. This suggested that up to 22% of putative anorectic binding sites may be located on the cell bodies of dopamine, norepinephrine, and other neurons, but not on serotonin or catecholamine nerve terminals in the brain. Binding to these sites may be downregulated by the development of DIO, possibly as a result of the concomitant hyperinsulinemia.;-;-;-;hard_0

Deletion of the distal three GC boxes resulted in a 50% reduction, and deletion of all GC boxes resulted in essentially complete loss of APRT activity. There are two predominant transcription start sites which are located within the region containing the GC boxes. The promoter behaved as a relatively strong promoter when compared to the RSV LTR promoter in a transient CAT assay, and operated in one orientation only.

6076;14982467;Role of solvent in determining conformational preferences of alanine dipeptide in water.;"Evidence from a variety of spectroscopic probes indicates that (phi, psi) values corresponding to the left-handed polyproline II helix (P(II)) are preferred for short alanine-based peptides in water. On the basis of results from theoretical studies, it is believed that the observed preference is dictated by favorable peptide-solvent interactions, which are realized through formation of optimal hydrogen-bonding water bridges between peptide donor and acceptor groups. In the present study, we address this issue explicitly by analyzing the hydration structure and thermodynamics of 16 low-energy conformers of the alanine dipeptide (N-acetylalanine-N'-methylamide) in liquid water. Monte Carlo simulations in the canonical ensemble were performed under ambient conditions with all-atom OPLS parameters for the alanine dipeptide and the TIP5P model for water. We find that the number of hydrogen-bonded water molecules connecting the peptide group donor and acceptor atoms has no effect on the solvation thermodynamics. Instead, the latter are determined by the work done to fully hydrate the peptide. This work is minimal for conformations that are characterized by a minimal overlap of the primary hydration shells around the peptide donor and acceptor atoms. As a result, peptide-solvent interactions favor ""compact"" conformations that do not include P(II)-like geometries. Our main conclusion is that the experimentally observed preference for P(II) does not arise due to favorable direct interactions between the peptide and water molecules. Instead, the latter act to unmask underlying conformational preferences that are a consequence of minimizing intrapeptide steric conflicts. ";polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function

Among the factors produced by PLX4032-resistant melanoma cell lines, CCL2 was higher compared to the sensitive parental cell lines and increased upon drug treatment. CCL2 acted as an autocrine growth factor for melanoma cells, stimulating the proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. In patients, CCL2 is detected in melanoma cells in tumors and in plasma at levels that correlate with tumor burden and lactate dehydrogenase. Vemurafenib treatment increased the CCL2 levels in plasma, whereas the long-term clinical response was associated with low CCL2 levels.Increased CCL2 production was associated with miRNA deregulation in the resistant cells. miR-34a, miR-100 and miR-125b showed high expression in both resistant cells and in tumor biopsies that were obtained from treated patients, and they were involved in the control of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Inhibition of CCL2 and of the selected miRNAs restored both the cell apoptosis and the drug efficacy in resistant melanoma cells.

6080;24284212;FOXD1 promotes nephron progenitor differentiation by repressing decorin in the embryonic kidney.;Forkhead transcription factors are essential for diverse processes in early embryonic development and organogenesis. Foxd1 is required during kidney development and its inactivation results in failure of nephron progenitor cell differentiation. Foxd1 is expressed in interstitial cells adjacent to nephron progenitor cells, suggesting an essential role for the progenitor cell niche in nephrogenesis. To better understand how cortical interstitial cells in general, and FOXD1 in particular, influence the progenitor cell niche, we examined the differentiation states of two progenitor cell subtypes in Foxd1(-/-) tissue. We found that although nephron progenitor cells are retained in a primitive CITED1-expressing compartment, cortical interstitial cells prematurely differentiate. To identify pathways regulated by FOXD1, we screened for target genes by comparison of Foxd1 null and wild-type tissues. We found that the gene encoding the small leucine-rich proteoglycan decorin (DCN) is repressed by FOXD1 in cortical interstitial cells, and we show that compound genetic inactivation of Dcn partially rescues the failure of progenitor cell differentiation in the Foxd1 null. We demonstrate that DCN antagonizes BMP/SMAD signaling, which is required for the transition of CITED1-expressing nephron progenitor cells to a state that is primed for WNT-induced epithelial differentiation. On the basis of these studies, we propose a mechanism for progenitor cell retention in the Foxd1 null in which misexpressed DCN produced by prematurely differentiated interstitial cells accumulates in the extracellular matrix, inhibiting BMP7-mediated transition of nephron progenitor cells to a compartment in which they can respond to epithelial induction signals.  ;polyleucine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

The kinetics of synthesis and secretion were studied by metabolic labelling with radioactive [35S]methionine, [14C]serine and [14C]threonine. Maximal incorporation rates required overnight pre-incubation of parasites in medium depleted of the appropriate amino acid. Larvae rapidly incorporated isotope into their somatic tissues, but there was a minimum delay of 10 h before secretion of labelled antigens. Labelling with [14C]serine and [14C]threonine demonstrated a relative abundance of these amino acids in the major surface/secreted glycoproteins of this nematode (TES-32 and 120). Pulse-chase experiments suggested that TES-120 may be derived from a 58 kDa precursor, reflecting extensive posttranslational glycosylation. Inhibition of N-glycosylation with tunicamycin and digestion with N-glycanase provided evidence of N-glycosylation in the lower molecular weight ES components (TES-32, 55 and 70). These agents had no effect on the higher molecular weight components (TES-120 and 400) implying that for these molecules glycosylation is predominantly O-linked. The largest ES component (TES-400) was unusual, in incorporating serine and threonine but not methionine, and by exhibiting increased apparent molecular weight following pronase digestion; it is suggested that this molecule is a proteoglycan.";polythreonine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

Neurocognitive function was measured by a battery of quantitative tests in a 453-person HIV-infected cohort and a 219-person HIV-seronegative control group. Neurocognitive function was then correlated with histories of either syphilis or gonorrhea to assess for possible relationships between these sexually transmitted diseases and neurologic impairment.


RESULTS
Human immunodeficiency virus-infected subjects with a history of either syphilis or gonorrhea tended to perform worse on neurocognitive testing than their counterparts. This difference could not be explained by educational attainment, age, race or CD4 cell count, and was not noted in the HIV-uninfected control subjects.


CONCLUSIONS
Sexually transmitted diseases in HIV-infected subjects are correlated with neurocognitive impairment through an unidentified mechanism.";-;-;-;hard_0
6084;1363247;Isolation of a new human pseudogene for proliferating cell nuclear antigen.;A new gene, which cross-hybridized with a rat PCNA cDNA probe, has been isolated from a human genomic cosmid library. A comparison of the gene with the human PCNA cDNA revealed 71% homology for the nucleotide sequences. This gene completely lacks introns and has traces of a polyA tail which the messenger RNA of the active gene retains. These facts indicate that this gene was generated by the reverse-transcription of a processed RNA for PCNA and exists as a PCNA pseudogene in the human genome. ;polyalanine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

6098;22178474;Slow amyloid nucleation via α-helix-rich oligomeric intermediates in short polyglutamine-containing huntingtin fragments.;The 17-amino-acid N-terminal segment (htt(NT)) that leads into the polyglutamine (polyQ) segment in the Huntington's disease protein huntingtin (htt) dramatically increases aggregation rates and changes the aggregation mechanism, compared to a simple polyQ peptide of similar length. With polyQ segments near or above the pathological repeat length threshold of about 37, aggregation of htt N-terminal fragments is so rapid that it is difficult to tease out mechanistic details. We describe here the use of very short polyQ repeat lengths in htt N-terminal fragments to slow this disease-associated aggregation. Although all of these peptides, in addition to htt(NT) itself, form α-helix-rich oligomeric intermediates, only peptides with Q(N) of eight or longer mature into amyloid-like aggregates, doing so by a slow increase in β-structure. Concentration-dependent circular dichroism and analytical ultracentrifugation suggest that the htt(NT) sequence, with or without added glutamine residues, exists in solution as an equilibrium between disordered monomer and α-helical tetramer. Higher order, α-helix rich oligomers appear to be built up via these tetramers. However, only htt(NT)Q(N) peptides with N=8 or more undergo conversion into polyQ β-sheet aggregates. These final amyloid-like aggregates not only feature the expected high β-sheet content but also retain an element of solvent-exposed α-helix. The α-helix-rich oligomeric intermediates appear to be both on- and off-pathway, with some oligomers serving as the pool from within which nuclei emerge, while those that fail to undergo amyloid nucleation serve as a reservoir for release of monomers to support fibril elongation. Based on a regular pattern of multimers observed in analytical ultracentrifugation, and a concentration dependence of α-helix formation in CD spectroscopy, it is likely that these oligomers assemble via a four-helix assembly unit. PolyQ expansion in these peptides appears to enhance the rates of both oligomer formation and nucleation from within the oligomer population, by structural mechanisms that remain unclear. ;polyglutamine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
6102;25489109;Overexpression of Q-rich prion-like proteins suppresses polyQ cytotoxicity and alters the polyQ interactome.;Expansion of a poly-glutamine (polyQ) repeat in a group of functionally unrelated proteins is the cause of several inherited neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington's disease. The polyQ length-dependent aggregation and toxicity of these disease proteins can be reproduced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This system allowed us to screen for genes that when overexpressed reduce the toxic effects of an N-terminal fragment of mutant huntingtin with 103 Q. Surprisingly, among the identified suppressors were three proteins with Q-rich, prion-like domains (PrDs): glycine threonine serine repeat protein (Gts1p), nuclear polyadenylated RNA-binding protein 3, and minichromosome maintenance protein 1. Overexpression of the PrD of Gts1p, containing an imperfect 28 residue glutamine-alanine repeat, was sufficient for suppression of toxicity. Association with this discontinuous polyQ domain did not prevent 103Q aggregation, but altered the physical properties of the aggregates, most likely early in the assembly pathway, as reflected in their increased SDS solubility. Molecular simulations suggested that Gts1p arrests the aggregation of polyQ molecules at the level of nonfibrillar species, acting as a cap that destabilizes intermediates on path to form large fibrils. Quantitative proteomic analysis of polyQ interactors showed that expression of Gts1p reduced the interaction between polyQ and other prion-like proteins, and enhanced the association of molecular chaperones with the aggregates. These findings demonstrate that short, Q-rich peptides are able to shield the interactive surfaces of toxic forms of polyQ proteins and direct them into nontoxic aggregates.  ;polyglutamine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
6104;8924208;Isolation, genomic structure, and expression of human erythroid Krüppel-like factor (EKLF).;Erythroid Krüppel-like factor (EKLF) is an essential transcriptional activator that directs high-level expression of the adult beta-globin promoter by binding to its CACCC element, one of a trio of highly conserved sequences present in erythroid cell-specific promoters and enhancers. This report describes the isolation and characterization of the human homolog of murine EKLF. The human EKLF transcription unit shares a number of structural properties with its marine counterpart. Human EKLF is contained within 3 kb of genomic DNA, and its coding region is interrupted by two introns whose locations are conserved with the murine gene. The three zinc fingers share >90% sequence similarity with and are predicted to bind the same target sequence as the mouse EKLF. The rest of the protein is proline-rich and retains approximately 70% sequence similarity to the mouse gene. Human EKLF is expressed in bone marrow and HEL, JK1, and OCIM1 erythroleukemic cell lines but not in K562 nor in myeloid or lymphoid cell lines. These results indicate that the genomic structure and erythroid-restricted expression of EKLF are highly conserved between the murine and human homologues. Availability of human EKLF will enable initiation of studies to molecularly assess whether it is functionally compromised in those cases of beta-thalassemia that contain a normal beta-globin gene locus.;polyproline;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
6105;28380354;The Drosophila hnRNP F/H Homolog Glorund Uses Two Distinct RNA-Binding Modes to Diversify Target Recognition.;The Drosophila hnRNP F/H homolog, Glorund (Glo), regulates nanos mRNA translation by interacting with a structured UA-rich motif in the nanos 3' untranslated region. Glo regulates additional RNAs, however, and mammalian homologs bind G-tract sequences to regulate alternative splicing, suggesting that Glo also recognizes G-tract RNA. To gain insight into how Glo recognizes both structured UA-rich and G-tract RNAs, we used mutational analysis guided by crystal structures of Glo's RNA-binding domains and identified two discrete RNA-binding surfaces that allow Glo to recognize both RNA motifs. By engineering Glo variants that favor a single RNA-binding mode, we show that a subset of Glo's functions in vivo is mediated solely by the G-tract binding mode, whereas regulation of nanos requires both recognition modes. Our findings suggest a molecular mechanism for the evolution of dual RNA motif recognition in Glo that may be applied to understanding the functional diversity of other RNA-binding proteins. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
6106;9729164;CDF-1 mediated repression of cell cycle genes targets a specific subset of transactivators.;The cdc25C, cyclin A and cdc2 genes are regulated during the cell cycle through two contiguous repressor binding sites, the CDE and CHR, located in the region of transcription initiation and interacting with a factor termed CDF-1. The target of this repression seems to be transcriptional activation of these promoters by transcription factors bound upstream. The majority of these factors falls into the class of glutamine-rich activators, suggesting that CDF-1-mediated repression might be activation domain specific. In the present study we have used chimeric promoter constructs to demonstrate that the cdc25C UAS, but not the core promoter, is crucial for repression. In addition, we show that only specific transcription factors and activation domains are responsive to CDE-CHR-mediated cell cycle regulation. These observations clearly indicate that CDF-1 interferes with activation of transcription by a specific subset of transactivators. The repressible activation domains belong to the same class of glutamine-rich activators, pointing to specific interactions of CDF-1 with components of the transcription machinery. In agreement with this conclusion we find that a simple inversion of the CDF-CHR module completely abrogates cell cycle-regulated repression. ;polyglutamine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

6108;34576086;Cyclic GMP-Dependent Regulation of Vascular Tone and Blood Pressure Involves Cysteine-Rich LIM-Only Protein 4 (CRP4).;The cysteine-rich LIM-only protein 4 (CRP4), a LIM-domain and zinc finger containing adapter protein, has been implicated as a downstream effector of the second messenger 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway in multiple cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). VSMCs and nitric oxide (NO)-induced cGMP signaling through cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I (cGKI) play fundamental roles in the physiological regulation of vascular tone and arterial blood pressure (BP). However, it remains unclear whether the vasorelaxant actions attributed to the NO/cGMP axis require CRP4. This study uses mice with a targeted deletion of the CRP4 gene (CRP4 KO) to elucidate whether cGMP-elevating agents, which are well known for their vasorelaxant properties, affect vessel tone, and thus, BP through CRP4. Cinaciguat, a NO- and heme-independent activator of the NO-sensitive (soluble) guanylyl cyclase (NO-GC) and NO-releasing agents, relaxed both CRP4-proficient and -deficient aortic ring segments pre-contracted with prostaglandin F2α. However, the magnitude of relaxation was slightly, but significantly, increased in vessels lacking CRP4. Accordingly, CRP4 KO mice presented with hypotonia at baseline, as well as a greater drop in systolic BP in response to the acute administration of cinaciguat, sodium nitroprusside, and carbachol. Mechanistically, loss of CRP4 in VSMCs reduced the Ca2+-sensitivity of the contractile apparatus, possibly involving regulatory proteins, such as myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1 (MYPT1) and the regulatory light chain of myosin (RLC). In conclusion, the present findings confirm that the adapter protein CRP4 interacts with the NO-GC/cGMP/cGKI pathway in the vasculature. CRP4 seems to be part of a negative feedback loop that eventually fine-tunes the NO-GC/cGMP axis in VSMCs to increase myofilament Ca2+ desensitization and thereby the maximal vasorelaxant effects attained by (selected) cGMP-elevating agents.;polycysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
6112;8219006;The effect of heparin and related proteoglycans on allergen and PAF-induced eosinophil infiltration.;Exposure of normal guinea pigs to an aerosol of PAF induced a selective increase in the percentage of eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid 24 h after challenge. Challenge of actively sensitised guinea pigs with an aerosol of ovalbumin also induced a selective increase in the percentage of eosinophils recovered in BAL fluid 24 h post challenge. Pretreatment of actively sensitised guinea pigs or normal guinea pigs with unfractionated heparin significantly reduced such eosinophil infiltration induced by allergen or PAF challenge respectively, although higher amounts of heparin were required to inhibit antigen induced eosinophil infiltration. Similar effects were also observed following treatment with the low molecular weight heparin-like material ORG 10172 but not the anionic molecule polyglutamic acid or high molecular weight dextrans. These results suggest that proteoglycans may possess anti-allergic activity that is not necessarily related to either such molecules being anionic in nature nor to anti-coagulant activity. ;polyglutamic;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
6113;20483233;Myogenin in model pufferfish species: Comparative genomic analysis and thermal plasticity of expression during early development.;Myogenin (Myog) is a muscle-specific basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that plays an essential role in the specification and differentiation of myoblasts. The myogenin genes from the tiger pufferfish, Takifugu rubripes, and green-spotted pufferfish, Tetraodon nigroviridis, were cloned and a comparative genomic analysis performed. The gene encoding myogenin is composed of three exons and has a relatively similar genomic structure in T. rubripes, T. nigroviridis and human. Introns 1 and 2 were approximately 2-fold and 8-fold longer respectively in human than pufferfish. Myogenin is located in a 100 kb region of conserved synteny between these organisms, corresponding to chromosome 1 in human, chromosome 11 in T. nigroviridis and scaffold 208 in T. rubripes. Pufferfish myogenin contained a serine-rich region at the carboxyl terminus that is highly conserved amongst teleosts. During embryonic development of T. rubripes, myogenin was expressed in a rostral-caudal gradient in the developing somites and subsequently during the pharyngula period in the pectoral fin bud primordia, jaw muscles and extraocular muscle precursors. In T. rubripes, the time required to form a somite pair during the linear phase of somitogenesis ( identical withsomite-interval) was 122 min, 97 min and 50 min in embryos incubated at 15, 18 and 21 degrees C, respectively. Myogenin mRNA transcripts were quantified using qPCR and normalised to the highest level of expression. Peak myogenin expression occurred later with respect to developmental stage (standardised using somite-intervals) and was over 2-fold higher at 21 degrees C than at either 18 or 15 degrees C. Changes in the relative timing and intensity of myogenin expression are a potential mechanism for explaining thermal plasticity of muscle phenotype in larvae via effects on the differentiation programme. ;polyserine;helix;-;LCR_with_function

6118;30433758;Fabrication and Characterization of Core-Shell Nanofibers Using a Next-Generation Airbrush for Biomedical Applications.;"The core-shell polymeric nanofiber, owing to its better controlled release of embedded or encapsulated drugs in contrast with the single-compartment nanofibers, has been extensively studied for biomedical applications such as tissue engineering and wound healing. Electrospinning with co-axial needles is the dominant technique to fabricate nanofiber mat, however, associated with potential limitations such as high voltage requirement, costly equipment, slow deposition rate, required trained personal, not suitable in situ fabrication, and direct deposition of core-shell nanofibers on the wound at patient bedside. To address the above limitations, the work aims to introduce a novel co-axial airbrushing method to fabricate core-shell nanofibers using a simple setup and low-cost equipment, yet having a unique ability for fabrication at patient bedside and direct deposition on wound bed. Air-brush with a coaxial needle is designed to flow two different polymers solution with model biomolecules through core [PEO (polyethylene oxide)/poly-dl-lactide/PCL (polycaprolactone)] and shell (PCL/PEO) needle for the fabrication of the model core-shell nanofiber. Various processing parameters such as flow rate, air pressure, working distance, and concentration of polymer solution which affect the morphology of core-shell nanofibers were studied and found to have a prominent effect. The PCL-PEO nanofiber possesses a defined shell and core structure, tunable sustained release behavior of model proteins (bovine serum albumin and basic fibroblast growth factor; bFGF), and improved mechanical strength. In vitro interaction of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells with core-shell fibers demonstrated the cytocompatibility and proliferative and differentiative (for bFGF loaded) properties of the core-shell nanofiber mat. Co-axial airbrushing can be used as a superior less-expensive technique for the fabrication of biomolecules/drug encapsulated core-shell fibers scaffold at patient bedside, which can mimic complex in vivo environment and could modulate cells behavior close to their in vivo condition for tissue regeneration and wound healing.";-;-;-;hard_0

6128;10671197;A subunit vaccine candidate region of the Entamoeba histolytica galactose-adherence lectin promotes interleukin-12 gene transcription and protein production in human macrophages.;The cysteine-rich region of the 170-kDa subunit galactose-adherence lectin (Gal-lectin) of Entamoeba histolytica is a subunit vaccine candidate and a protective antigen in the gerbil model of amebiasis. Macrophage-mediated immunity is important for protection against E. histolytica and is activated by Th1 cytokines. As Th1 differentiation is promoted by IL-12, we investigated what portion of the Gal-lectin could stimulate IL-12 in human THP-1 macrophages. Native Gal-lactin stimulated IL-12 p40 / p35 mRNA expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner as measured by reverse transcriptase-PCR. Human immune serum and Gal-lectin mAb inhibition studies identified amino acids (aa) 596 - 998 as immunogenic and containing the IL-12 inducing domain. IFN-gamma priming augmented Gal-lectin-induced IL-12 mRNA expression independent of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, and was required for IL-12 p70 protein production from macrophages and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Gal-lectin plus IFN-gamma stimulated IL-12 p40 and p35 gene transcription with stable mRNA transcripts and a differential requirement for protein synthesis. These results suggest that aa 596 - 998 of the Gal-lectin can confer Th1-mediated protection against amebiasis through IL-12 induction. ;polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
6129;22651890;Overlapping effector interfaces define the multiple functions of the HIV-1 Nef polyproline helix.;"HIV-1 Nef is a multifunctional protein required for full pathogenicity of the virus. As Nef has no known enzymatic activity, it necessarily functions through protein-protein interaction interfaces. A critical Nef protein interaction interface is centered on its polyproline segment (P69VRPQVPLRP78) which contains the helical SH3 domain binding protein motif, PXXPXR. We hypothesized that any Nef-SH3 domain interactions would be lost upon mutation of the prolines or arginine of PXXPXR. Further, mutation of the non-motif ""X"" residues, (Q73, V74, and L75) would give altered patterns of inhibition for different Nef/SH3 domain protein interactions. We found that mutations of either of the prolines or the arginine of PXXPXR are defective for Nef-Hck binding, Nef/activated PAK2 complex formation and enhancement of virion infectivity (EVI). Mutation of the non-motif ""X"" residues (Q, V and L) gave similar patterns of inhibition for Nef/activated PAK2 complex formation and EVI which were distinct from the pattern for Hck binding. These results implicate an SH3 domain containing protein other than Hck for Nef/activated PAK2 complex formation and EVI. We have also mutated Nef residues at the N-and C-terminal ends of the polyproline segment to explore interactions outside of PXXPXR. We discovered a new locus GFP/F (G67, F68, P69 and F90) that is required for Nef/activated PAK2 complex formation and EVI.MHC Class I (MHCI) downregulation was only partially inhibited by mutating the PXXPXR motif residues, but was fully inhibited by mutating the C-terminal P78. Further, we observed that MHCI downregulation strictly requires G67 and F68. Our mutational analysis confirms the recently reported structure of the complex between Nef, AP-1 μ1 and the cytoplasmic tail of MHCI, but does not support involvement of an SH3 domain protein in MHCI downregulation. Nef has evolved to be dependent on interactions with multiple SH3 domain proteins. To the N- and C- terminal sides of the polyproline helix are multifunctional protein interaction sites. The polyproline segment is also adapted to downregulate MHCI with a non-canonical binding surface. Our results demonstrate that Nef polyproline helix is highly adapted to directly interact with multiple host cell proteins. ";polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function
6130;24411565;The role of SATB2 in skeletogenesis and human disease.;"Since the discovery of SATB2 (special AT-rich sequence binding protein 2) a decade ago, its pivotal roles in development and tissue regeneration have emerged, particularly in craniofacial patterning and development, palate formation, and osteoblast differentiation and maturation. As a member of the special AT-rich binding proteins family that bind to nuclear matrix-attachment regions (MAR), it also displays functional versatility in central nervous development, especially corpus callosum and pons formation, cancer development and prognosis, as well as in immune regulation. At the molecular level, Satb2 gene expression appears to be tissue and stage-specific, and is regulated by several cytokines and growth factors, such as BMP2/4/7, insulin, CNTF, and LIF via ligand receptor signaling pathways. SATB2 mainly performs a twofold role as a transcription regulator by directly binding to AT-rich sequences in MARs to modulate chromatin remodeling, or through association with other transcription factors to modulate the cis-regulation elements and thus to regulate the expression of down-stream target genes and a wide range of biological processes. This contemporary review provides an exploration of the molecular characteristics and function of SATB2; including its expression and cytokine regulation, its involvement in human disease, and its potential roles in skeletogenesis.

6131;27984373;HNRNPA1, a Splicing Regulator, Is an Effective Target Protein for Cervical Cancer Detection: Comparison With Conventional Tumor Markers.;Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (HNRNPA1), serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1), and SRSF3 are splicing regulators associated with oncogenesis. However, the alterations of SF proteins and their diagnostic values in cervical cancer are unclear. To apply SFs clinically, effective marker selection and characterization of the target organ properties are essential. We concurrently analyzed HNRNPA1, SRSF1, SRSF3, and the conventional tumor markers squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in cervical tissue samples (n = 127) using semiquantitative immunoblotting. In addition, we compared them with p16 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A [CDKN2A]), which has shown high diagnostic efficacy in immunohistochemical staining studies and has been proposed as a candidate protein for point-of-care screening biochemical tests of cervical neoplasia. HNRNPA1, higher molecular weight forms of SRSF1 (SRSF1-HMws), SRSF3, CEA, and p16 levels were higher (P < 0.05) in cervical carcinoma tissue samples than in nontumoral cervical tissue samples. However, the levels of SRSF1-Total (sum of SRSF1-HMws and a lower molecular weight form of SRSF1) and SCCA, a commonly used cervical tumor marker, were not different between carcinoma and nontumoral tissue samples. In paired sample comparisons, HNRNPA1 (94%) showed the highest incidence of up-regulation (carcinoma/nontumor, >1.5) in cervical carcinoma, followed by p16 (84%), SRSF1-HMws (69%), SRSF3 (66%), CEA (66 %), SCCA (32%), and SRSF1-Total (31%). HNRNPA1 (92%) and p16 (91%) presented the two highest diagnostic accuracies for cervical carcinoma, which were superior to those of SRSF3 (75%), SRSF1-HMws (72%), CEA (72%), SCCA (59%), and SRSF1-Total (55%). Our results identified that HNRNPA1 is the best diagnostic marker among the SFs and conventional markers given its excellent diagnostic efficacy for cervical carcinoma, and it has a p16-comparable diagnostic value. We suggest that HNRNPA1 is an additional effective target protein for developing cervical cancer detection tools. ;polyarginine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
6132;12496292;Domain analysis of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein, Nab2p. Dissecting the requirements for Nab2p-facilitated poly(A) RNA export.;Mature poly(A) RNA transcripts are exported from the nucleus in complex with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs). Nab2p is an essential Saccharomyces cerevisiae hnRNP protein that interacts with poly(A) RNA and shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Functional Nab2p is required for export of poly(A) RNA from the nucleus. The Nab2 protein consists of the following four domains: a unique N-terminal domain, a glutamine-rich domain, an arginine-glycine (RGG) domain, and a zinc finger domain. We generated Nab2p deletion mutants to analyze the contribution of each domain to the in vivo function of Nab2p. We first tested whether the deletion mutants could replace the essential NAB2 gene. We then examined the impact of these mutations on Nab2p localization, poly(A) RNA localization, and association of Nab2p with poly(A) RNA. Our analyses revealed that the N-terminal domain is required for nuclear export of both poly(A) RNA and Nab2p. We confirm that the RGG domain is important for Nab2p import in vivo. Finally, the zinc finger domain is critical for the interaction between Nab2p and poly(A) RNA in vivo. Our data support a model where Nab2p associates with poly(A) RNA in the nucleus through the zinc finger domain and facilitates the export of the poly(A) RNA through protein interactions mediated by the N-terminal domain. ;polyglutamine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
6133;8138239;Evidence of gestational heroin or nicotine exposure by analysis of fetal hair.;Failure to identify tobacco- or heroin-exposed neonates is extensive owing to the limitations of current methods used to verify maternal drug use. Maternal self-reported drug history has been shown to be unreliable: many women who deny use during pregnancy exhibit drug metabolites in their urine. Maternal systematic urinalysis is hampered by the short elimination half-life of the drugs. This test is not suitable for validation of survey data since the quantification of drugs in urine only reflects exposure during the preceding 1-3 days and does not necessarily indicate the frequency in subjects who might deliberately abstain for several days before biomedical screenings. The same disadvantages are noted with the analysis of babies' meconium, or the amniotic fluids which are only a qualitative test at the moment of delivery. Hair analysis remedies the disadvantages of these currently available methods by exhibiting a wide window of detection and may provide information concerning the severity of gestational exposure. Hair samples were collected at time of delivery from 40 and 9 neonates whose mothers were known, by self-report, to be smokers and heroin users during the prenatal period, respectively. Hair was decontaminated in dichloromethane (37 degrees C, 15 min) and homogenizated in NaOH (1 M, 10 min, 90 degrees C). Nicotine and opiates were extracted in diethylether at pH 14, and in chloroform/isopropanol/n-heptane (50:17:33 v/v) at pH 9.2, respectively. After separation on a BP-5 capillary column, drugs were identified and quantified by GC/MS using selected ion monitoring.

6139;10567407;Cell type-specific autoregulation of the Caudal-related homeobox gene Cdx-2/3.;"The caudal-related homeobox gene Cdx-2/3 is a critical ""master"" control gene in embryogenesis. Mice heterozygous for a null mutation in Cdx-2/3 exhibit multiple malfunctions including tail abnormalities, stunted growth, a homeotic shift in vertebrae, and the development of multiple intestinal adenomatous polyps, indicating that Cdx-2/3 is haplo-insufficient. In vitro studies have identified more than a half-dozen downstream target genes expressed in pancreatic and intestinal cells for this transcription factor. We have examined the transcriptional properties of the mouse Cdx-2/3 promoter. This promoter could be autoregulated in pancreatic and intestinal cells that express endogenous Cdx-2/3. In contrast, Cdx-2/3 transfection represses the Cdx-2/3 promoter in fibroblasts, which do not express endogenous Cdx-2/3. Since Cdx-2/3 activates proglucagon gene promoter in both pancreatic and intestinal cells and in fibroblasts, we suggest that some, yet to be identified, cell type-specific components are required for activating selected target gene promoters of Cdx-2/3, including the Cdx-2/3 promoter itself. Cdx-2/3 binds to the TATA box and another AT-rich motif, designated as DBS, within an evolutionarily conserved proximal element of the Cdx-2/3 promoter. The DBS motif is critical for the autoregulation, whereas the TATA box may act as an attenuating element for the autoregulatory loop. Finally, overexpression of Cdx-2/3 in a pancreatic cell line activated the expression of the endogenous Cdx-2/3. Taken together, our results indicate that the dose-dependent phenotype of Cdx-2/3 expression on its downstream targets in vivo could be regulated initially via a transcriptional network involving cell type-specific autoregulation of the Cdx-2/3 promoter.

The disease usually runs an intermittent and unpredictable course over years or decades and may have, if the edemas involve the tongue or the central nervous system, an ambiguous outcome. Greatly disfiguring oro-facial swellings often result from secondary persistence of the primarily recurrent edemas. A classification on grounds of different 'major' and 'minor signs' of MRS is proposed in the present paper. In recent years, novel therapeutic approaches involving either oral clofazimine or laser beam acupuncture (according to the principles of traditional Chinese medicine) have proven to be successful in some cases of MRS. Dermatology could play a larger role in oral medicine by taking diseases such as MRS into account in studies among specialties dealing with oro-facial pathoses.;-;-;-;hard_0
6143;26715415;Activation of Antigen-Specific CD8(+) T Cells by Poly-DL-Lactide/Glycolide (PLGA) Nanoparticle-Primed Gr-1(high) Cells.;The aim of this study was to investigate the induction of antigen-specific T cell activation and cell cycle modulation by a poly-DL-lactide/glycolide (PLGA) nanoparticle (NP)-primed CD11b(+)Gr-1(high) subset isolated from mouse bone marrow. PLGA NPs containing the ovalbumin (OVA) antigen were prepared using the double emulsion and solvent evaporation method, and protein release rate and cell viability were determined. The Lin2(¯)CD11b(+)Gr-1(high)Ly6c(low) (Gr-1(high)) subset was sorted from the bone marrow of C57BL/6 J mice by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and co-cultured with OT-I CD8(+) splenic T cells. Proliferation of OT-I CD8(+) T cells was monitored, and cell cycles were determined by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling. Treatment of Gr-1(high) cells with PLGA/OVA NPs upregulated expression of the SIINFEKL-H2K(b) complex in the context of MHC I. Co-cultures of OT-I CD8(+) T cells with the PLGA/OVA NP-primed Gr-1(high) cells induced the proliferation of T cells in vitro and modulated cell division and morphology. Treatment of Gr-1(high) cells with PLGA/OVA NPs also induced cell apoptosis and necrosis. This study demonstrated the function of PLGA/OVA NPs in the activation of OT-I CD8(+) T cells and the capability of cross-presentation via the Gr-1(high) polymorphonuclear subset from mouse bone marrow. ;polyaspartic;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
6147;8045930;Isolation and characterization of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mRNA transport-defective (mtr) mutants.;"To understand the mechanisms of mRNA transport in eukaryotes, we have isolated Saccharomyces cerevisiae temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants which accumulate poly(A)+ RNA in the nucleus at the restrictive temperature. A total of 21 recessive mutants were isolated and classified into 16 complementation groups. Backcrossed mRNA transport-defective strains from each complementation group have been analyzed. A strain which is ts for heat shock transcription factor was also analyzed since it also shows nuclear accumulation of poly(A)+ RNA at 37 degrees C. At 37 degrees C the mRNA of each mutant is characterized by atypically long polyA tails. Unlike ts pre-mRNA splicing mutants, these strains do not interrupt splicing of pre-mRNA at 37 degrees C; however four strains accumulate oversized RNA polymerase II transcripts. Some show inhibition of rRNA processing and a further subset of these strains is also characterized by inhibition of tRNA maturation. Several strains accumulate nuclear proteins in the cytoplasm when incubated at semipermissive temperature. Remarkably, many strains exhibit nucleolar fragmentation or enlargement at the restrictive temperature. Most strains show dramatic ultrastructural alterations of the nucleoplasm or nuclear membrane. Distinct mutants accumulate poly(A)+ RNA in characteristic patterns in the nucleus."; polyalanine ;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
6150;26786280;Effect of TFE on the Helical Content of AK17 and HAL-1 Peptides: Theoretical Insights into the Mechanism of Helix Stabilization.;Fluorinated alcohols such as 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) are among the most frequently used cosolvents in experiment studies of peptides. They have significant effects on secondary structure and a particularly strong promotion of α-helix is induced by TFE. In this study we validated recently proposed force field parameters for TFE in molecular dynamics simulations with two model peptides-alanine-rich AK-17 and antimicrobial peptide halictine-1 (HAL-1). In the case of HAL-1, we characterized the effect of TFE on this peptide experimentally by ECD spectroscopy. Our TFE model in question reproduced the helix-promoting effect of TFE and provided insight into the mechanisms of TFE action on peptides. Our simulations confirmed the preferential interaction of TFE molecules with α-helices, although the TFE molecules accumulate in the vicinity of the peptides in various conformations. Moreover, we observed a significant effect of TFE on the thermodynamics of the helix-coil transition and a change in local conformational preferences in the unfolded (coil) state induced by TFE. In addition, our simulation-based analysis suggests that different mechanisms participate in helix stabilization in both model peptides in water and TFE solution. Our results thus support the picture of complex TFE action on peptides that is further diversified by the identity and intrinsic properties of the peptide.  ;polyalanine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
6152;29034105;Changes of the Intestinal Microbiome-Host Homeostasis in HIV-Infected Individuals - A Focus on the Bacterial Gut Microbiome.;Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections cause severe CD4+ T cell depletion leading to chronic inflammation and immune activation, impaired barrier function, and microbial translocation. Even under effective antiretroviral therapy, these processes persist, leading to gut microbiome dysbiosis and disturbance of microbiome-host homeostasis. This systematic review aims at analyzing how gut microbiome and host immune system influence each other during HIV pathogenesis. An online search applying the PubMed database was conducted. The number of total results (n = 35) was narrowed down to 5 relevant studies focusing on the interaction between the host and gut microbiome, whereas strict exclusion criteria were applied, thereby assuring that no other comorbidities impacted study results. Our analyses revealed that gut microbiome diversity correlated positively with CD4+ T cell counts and negatively with microbial translocation markers. However, quantitative changes in bacterial richness did not consistently correlate with the numbers of metabolically active bacterial populations. Despite the reported increase in potentially pathogenic bacteria and, conversely, decrease in protective populations, the gut microbiota exhibited immune-modulating qualities given that mucosal inflammatory sequelae were dampened by decreasing pro-inflammatory and accelerating anti-inflammatory cytokine responses. Future research is needed to further elucidate these findings, to gain a deeper insight into host-microbiota interactions and to develop novel therapeutic strategies.;-;-;-;hard_0
6155;10490645;Regulation of RelA subcellular localization by a putative nuclear export signal and p50.;Nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) represents a family of dimeric DNA binding proteins, the pleotropic form of which is a heterodimer composed of RelA and p50 subunits. The biological activity of NF-kappaB is controlled through its subcellular localization. Inactive NF-kappaB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by physical interaction with an inhibitor, IkappaBalpha. Signal-mediated IkappaBalpha degradation triggers the release and subsequent nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. It remains unknown whether the NF-kappaB shuttling between the cytoplasm and nucleus is subjected to additional steps of regulation. In this study, we demonstrated that the RelA subunit of NF-kappaB exhibits strong cytoplasmic localization activity even in the absence of IkappaBalpha inhibition. The cytoplasmic distribution of RelA is largely mediated by a leucine-rich sequence homologous to the recently characterized nuclear export signal (NES). This putative NES is both required and sufficient to mediate cytoplasmic localization of RelA as well as that of heterologous proteins. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic distribution of RelA is sensitive to a nuclear export inhibitor, leptomycin B, suggesting that RelA undergoes continuous nuclear export. Interestingly, expression of p50 prevents the cytoplasmic expression of RelA, leading to the nuclear accumulation of both RelA and p50. Together, these results suggest that the nuclear and cytoplasmic shuttling of RelA is regulated by both an intrinsic NES-like sequence and the p50 subunit of NF-kappaB. ;polyleucine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
6160;8397373;Activin receptor-like kinases: a novel subclass of cell-surface receptors with predicted serine/threonine kinase activity.;"Human cDNA clones encoding four novel putative transmembrane protein serine/threonine kinases, denoted activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) -1, -2, -3 and -4, were obtained using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based strategy. The PCR primers were designed based upon the sequence similarity between the activin receptor type II and Daf-1. The cDNA clones for ALK-1, -2 and -3 encode complete proteins of 503, 509 and 532 amino acids respectively. The ALK-4 cDNA is incomplete and the predicted protein of 383 amino acids has a truncated extracellular domain. The ALKs share similar domain structures, comprising predicted signal sequences at the N-terminals, followed by hydrophilic cysteine-rich ligand-binding domains, single hydrophobic transmembrane regions and C-terminal intracellular portions that consist almost entirely of putative serine/threonine kinase domains. The ALKs have approximately 40% sequence identity to activin receptors type II and IIB, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) type II receptor and Daf-1 in the kinase domains. However, the sequence identities are higher (60-79%) between ALK-1, -2, -3 and -4, suggesting that they form a subfamily among the putative receptor serine/threonine kinases. The extracellular domains of ALKs show only little sequence identity to other putative receptor serine/threonine kinases, but the cysteine residues are conserved. Their structural properties suggest that ALK-1 to -4 are receptors that may bind ligands that are members of the TGF-beta superfamily. The expression of mRNA in human tissues varied for the different ALKs; ALK-2 and ALK-4 showed ubiquitous tissue expression patterns, whereas the distribution of ALK-1 and ALK-3 varied strongly between different tissues with more restricted expression patterns. These results suggest that each ALK may have different in vivo functions.";polycysteine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
6161;18692067;The affinity of Ets-1 for DNA is modulated by phosphorylation through transient interactions of an unstructured region.;Binding of the transcription factor Ets-1 to DNA is allosterically regulated by a serine-rich region (SRR) that modulates the dynamic character of the adjacent structured DNA-binding ETS domain and its flanking autoinhibitory elements. Multi-site phosphorylation of the flexible SRR in response to Ca(2+) signaling mediates variable regulation of Ets-1 DNA-binding affinity. In this study, we further investigated the mechanism of this regulation. First, thermal and urea denaturation experiments demonstrated that phosphorylation of the predominantly unstructured SRR imparts enhanced thermodynamic stability on the well-folded ETS domain and its inhibitory module. We next identified a minimal fragment (residues 279-440) that exhibits both enhanced autoinhibition of Ets-1 DNA-binding and allosteric reinforcement by phosphorylation. To test for intramolecular interactions between the SRR and the rest of the fragment that were not detectable by (1)H-(1)H NOE measurements, paramagnetic relaxation enhancements were performed using Cu(2+) bound to the N-terminal ATCUN motif. Increased relaxation detected for specific amide and methyl groups revealed a preferential interaction surface for the flexible SRR extending from the inhibitory module to the DNA-binding interface. Phosphorylation enhanced the localization of the SRR to this surface. We therefore hypothesize that the positioning of the SRR at the DNA-binding interface and its role in shifting Ets-1 to an inhibited conformation are linked. In particular, transient interactions dampen the conformational flexibility of the ETS domain and inhibitory module required for high-affinity binding, as well as possibly occlude the DNA interaction site. Surprisingly, the phosphorylation-dependent effects were relatively insensitive to changes in ionic strength, suggesting that electrostatic forces are not the dominant mechanism for mediating these interactions. The results of this study highlight the role of flexibility and transient binding in the variable regulation of Ets-1 activity. ;polyserine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
6164;21955986;Characterization of a new ARID family transcription factor (Brightlike/ARID3C) that co-activates Bright/ARID3A-mediated immunoglobulin gene transcription.;Two members, Bright/ARID3A and Bdp/ARID3B, of the ARID (AT-Rich Interaction Domain) transcription family are distinguished by their ability to specifically bind to DNA and to self-associate via a second domain, REKLES. Bright and Bdp positively regulate immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IgH) transcription by binding to AT-rich motifs within Matrix Associating Regions (MARs) residing within a subset of V(H) promoters and the Eμ intronic enhancer. In addition, REKLES provides Bright nuclear export function, and a small pool of Bright is directed to plasma membrane sub-domains/lipid rafts where it associates with and modulates signaling of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR). Here, we characterize a third, highly conserved, physically condensed ARID3 locus, Brightlike/ARID3C. Brightlike encodes two alternatively spliced, SUMO-I-modified isoforms that include or exclude (Δ6) the REKLES-encoding exon 6. Brightlike transcripts and proteins are expressed preferentially within B lineage lymphocytes and coordinate with highest Bright expression in activated follicular B cells. Brightlike, but not BrightlikeΔ6, undergoes nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling with a fraction localizing within lipid rafts following BCR stimulation. Brightlike, but not BrightlikeΔ6, associates with Bright in solution, at common DNA binding sites in vitro, and is enriched at Bright binding sites in chromatin. Although possessing little transactivation capacity of its own, Brightlike significantly co-activates Bright-dependent IgH transcription with maximal activity mediated by the unsumoylated form. In sum, this report introduces Brightlike as an additional functional member of the family of ARID proteins, which should be considered in regulatory circuits, previously ascribed to be mediated by Bright. ;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
6165;8132322;Protection of gerbils from amebic liver abscess by immunization with a recombinant Entamoeba histolytica antigen.;"Amebiasis, infection by the intestinal protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica, is a leading parasitic cause of death. As a step in the development of a recombinant antigen vaccine to prevent E. histolytica infection, we looked at the ability of a recombinant version of the serine-rich E. histolytica protein (SREHP) to elicit a protective immune response against invasive amebic disease. Gerbils, a standard model for amebic liver abscess, were immunized with either a recombinant SREHP/maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion, recombinant MBP alone, or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), all combined with complete Freund's adjuvant. In the first trial (group 1), gerbils received a primary and two booster immunizations intraperitoneally; in the second trial (group 2), gerbils were immunized by a single intradermal injection. SREHP/MBP-immunized gerbils in both groups produced antibody to native SHEHP and developed delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to recombinant SREHP. All gerbils were challenged by an intrahepatic injection with 5 x 10(4) virulent E. histolytica HM1-IMSS trophozoites. Complete protection from amebic liver abscess was seen in 64% of the SHEHP/MBP-immunized gerbils in group 1 and in 100% of the SREHP/MBP-immunized gerbils in group 2. There was no protection observed in MBP- or PBS-immunized gerbils in either group. Our results indicate that the SREHP molecule has potential as a vaccine to prevent amebic infection and demonstrate that successful vaccination of animals with recombinant E. histolytica antigen vaccines is possible.

A decrease in output during the lifetime of the shock head to less than 50% of its original output was observed. Decreased output was related to a higher number of shocks per treatment and a higher retreatment rate. Quality control of the lithotriptor output was reflected in better clinical results, a lower mean number of shocks per treatment, a lower retreatment rate and less time on the table, which has important clinical and financial implications.

Recently, comparable NSP1 sequence analysis has been performed on a number of rotavirus strains from various species. Furthermore, characterization of mutants with rearranged NSP1 genes has helped to elucidate the structure-function interaction of NSP1.

We sought to utilize this approach to quantify two important seminal characteristics, acrosomal integrity and sperm viability, and to compare these with classical microscopic measurements of acrosomal integrity and sperm motility. Samples of thawed, cryopreserved sperm packaged in 0.5-ml French straws were obtained from 12 Holstein bulls. Classical acrosomal assessments and sperm motility estimates were made using differential interference contrast microscopy. Fluorescent acrosomal probes included LysoTracker Green DND-26 (LYSO-G), fluorescein-labeled peanut agglutinin, the biotinylated isocoumarin serine protease inhibitor Bi-Aca-Aca-OMe-IC that was secondarily labeled with fluorescein-avidin, and rabbit antibodies to bovine acrosin that were secondarily labeled with fluoresceinated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin. The fluorescent probes for sperm viability were a combination of SYBR-14 and propidium iodide (PI) or of SYTO-17 and PI. Significant differences were found among methods and among bulls, but not among straws (n = 3). All four fluorescent measures of acrosomal integrity showed highly significant correlations with both classical measurements. These data indicated that the quality of cryopreserved bovine sperm samples could be readily quantified using a variety of organelle-specific fluorescent staining techniques.;-;-;-;hard_0
6182;6644020;IgE antibody-mediated cutaneous basophil hypersensitivity reactions in guinea pigs.;Cutaneous basophil hypersensitivity (CBH) reactions are a heterogeneous group of delayed time course basophil-rich immune responses that can be mediated in the guinea pig by T cells, B cells, or IgG1 antibody. This study examined whether guinea pig IgE antibody could also mediate CBH reactions. IgE antibody to picryl or oxazolone determinants was induced by immunizing Hartley strain guinea pigs pretreated with cyclophosphamide. Hyperimmune serum from these animals was passed through a heavy chain-specific anti-IgG1 affinity column. The presence of IgE anti-hapten antibody in the filtrate fraction was verified by passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) testing with a 7-day period of local passive sensitization and by the heat lability (56 degrees C, 4 hr) of PCA activity. This IgE-rich fraction and the IgG1 fraction eluted from the column with base (0.2 M Na2CO3, pH 11.3) were transferred i.v. to separate groups of normal guinea pigs. Both fractions mediated delayed time course reactions that contained basophils. Macroscopic and microscopic reactions mediated by the IgE-rich fraction were abolished with heat (56 degrees C, 4 hr). Thus, two antigen-specific factors in guinea pig serum can mediate delayed time course basophil-containing reactions: IgG1 and IgE antibodies. IgE-mediated CBH reactions are similar to the late-phase reaction that follows IgE-dependent wheal-and-flare reactions in humans. The finding that guinea pig IgE can mediate a late reaction that contains basophils makes this a possible model for the human late-phase response, and suggests that some forms of CBH may play a role in human allergic disease.;polyglutamic;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

6185;14597566;Helicobacter pylori stimulates host vascular endothelial growth factor-A (vegf-A) gene expression via MEK/ERK-dependent activation of Sp1 and Sp3.;VEGF-A is a key regulator of inflammatory and tumor-associated angiogenesis. H. pylori plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of benign and malignant gastric diseases. It has been suggested that H. pylori infection is associated with activation of host angiogenesis, however, underlying mechanisms as well as angiogenic growth factors activated by the bacterium have not yet been identified. Therefore, we investigated the influence of the bacterium on VEGF-A as a candidate host target gene in vivo and in vitro. We show that H. pylori potently up-regulates production and release of VEGF-A protein as well as vegf-A mRNA levels, and we provide strong evidence that enhanced recruitment of Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors to two proximal GC-rich vegf-A promoter elements mediates H. pylori-triggered vegf-A gene expression. In addition, H. pylori infection increased the transactivating capacity of both Sp1 and Sp3, which suggests additional mechanism(s) of vegf-A gene regulation by the bacterium. Signaling studies identified the MEK>ERK1/-2 kinase cascade as principal host signaling pathway mediating H. pylori-stimulated vegf-A transcription. By identifying H. pylori as potent activator of vegf-A gene expression and characterization of underlying molecular mechanisms, our results provide novel insights into pathways linking the bacterium to host angiogenesis and may help to develop strategies to influence vegf-A gene expression in the setting of H. pylori infection. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
6190;1881878;Proline in alpha-helix: stability and conformation studied by dynamics simulation.;"Free-energy simulations have been used to estimate the change in the conformational stability of short polyalanine alpha-helices when one of the alanines is replaced by a proline residue. For substituting proline in the middle of the helix the change in free energy of folding (delta delta G degrees) was calculated as 14 kJ/mol (3.4 kcal/mol), in excellent agreement with the one available experimental value. The helix containing proline was found to be strongly kinked; the free energy for reducing the angle of the kink from 40 degrees to 15 degrees was calculated, and found to be small. A tendency to alternate hydrogen bonding schemes was observed in the proline-containing helix. These observations for the oligopeptide agree well with the observation of a range of kink angles (18-35 degrees) and variety of hydrogen bonding schemes, in the rare instances where proline occurs in helices in globular proteins. For substituting proline at the N-terminus of the helix the change in free energy of folding (delta delta G degrees) was calculated as -4 kJ/mol in the first helical position (N1) and +6 kJ/mol in the second helical position (N2). The observed frequent occurrence of proline in position N1 in alpha-helices in proteins therefore has its origin in stability differences of secondary structure. The conclusion reached here that proline may be a better helix former in position N1 than (even) alanine, and thus be a helix initiator may be testable experimentally by measurements of fraction helical conformation of individual residues in oligopeptides of appropriate sequence. The relevance of these results in regards to the frequent occurrence of proline-containing helices in certain membrane proteins is discussed."; polyalanine ;helix;-;LCR_with_function
6195;26808268;Arginine- and Polyamine-Induced Lactic Acid Resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae.;Microbe-derived lactic acid protects women from pathogens in their genital tract. The purpose of this study was to determine lactic acid susceptibility of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and identify potential acid resistance mechanisms present in this pathogen. Tested in vitro, lactic acid killed all 10 gonococcal strains analyzed in a low pH-dependent manner. Full inactivation occurred at pH 4.5. At low pH, lactic acid treatment resulted in the entry of the DNA-binding fluorochrome propidium iodide into the microbial cells, suggesting that hydrogen ions from lactic acid compromise the integrity of the bacterial cell wall/membrane. Most likely, hydrogen ions also inactivate intracellular proteins since arginine rendered significant protection against lactic acid presumably through action of the gonococcal arginine decarboxylase, an enzyme located in the bacterial cytoplasm. Surprisingly, arginine also lessened lactic acid-mediated cell wall/membrane disruption. This effect is probably mediated by agmatine, a triamine product of arginine decarboxylase, since agmatine demonstrated a stronger protective effect on GC than arginine at equal molar concentration. In addition to agmatine, diamines cadaverine and putrescine, which are generated by bacterial vaginosis-associated microbes, also induced significant resistance to lactic acid-mediated GC killing and cell wall/membrane disruption. These findings suggest that the arginine-rich semen protects gonococci through both neutralization-dependent and independent mechanisms, whereas polyamine-induced acid resistance contributes to the increased risk of gonorrhea in women with bacterial vaginosis.  ;polyarginine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

The structure of the N-terminal SH3 domain from growth factor receptor-binding protein 2 (Grb2), an adapter protein in the intracellular signaling pathway to Ras, was investigated by circular dichroic (CD) spectroscopy. The compact native beta-barrel conformation, previously elucidated by NMR spectroscopy, was largely predominant at pH = 4.8, in the absence of salt. From the structural changes induced by varying pH, ionic strength, temperature, or hydrophobicity of the environment, evidence for the existence of distinct nonnative conformations was obtained in the far- and near-UV domains. Along the free energy scale, these appear to distribute into two conformational ensembles, depending on the extent of structural and thermodynamic differences compared to the native conformation. The first ensemble consists of non-native conformations with a nativelike secondary structure, and the second is composed of partially unfolded conformations having short alpha-helical fragments or turnlike motifs in their nonnative secondary structure. Most of the observed nonnative conformations exist in mild or nondenaturing conditions. They probably have distinct compactness of their inner structure, depending on the strength of nonlocal interactions, but only the native all-beta conformation possesses a condensed protein exterior, appropriate for the binding to the VPPPVPPRRR decapeptide from Sos. Upon binding, the native conformation undergoes a local tertiary structure change in a hydrophobic pocket at the binding site. This is accompanied by the PP-II helix folding of the proline-rich peptide. Interestingly, in the near-UV domain, a significant change in the spectral contribution of an aromatic exciton was observed, thus allowing quantitative tracking of the binding process. ;polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function

About 50 restriction endonuclease cleavage sites were mapped in each mitochondrial DNA, and the six maps were aligned with respect to 11 invariant positions. Differences among the maps were evident at 121 positions. Both conserved and variable sites are widely dispersed in the mitochondrial genome. Besides site differences, ascribed to point mutations, there is evidence for one rearrangement: the gorilla map is shorter than the other owing to the deletion of 95 base pairs near the origin of replication. The parsimony method of deriving all six maps from a common ancestor produced a genealogical tree in which the common and pygmy chimpanzee maps are the most closely related pair; the closest relative of this pair is the gorilla map; most closely related to this trio is the human map. This tree is only slightly more parsimonious than some alternative trees. Although this study has given a magnified view of the genetic differences among humans and apes, the possibility of a three-way split among the lineages leading to humans, gorillas, and chimpanzees still deserves serious consideration.";-;-;-;hard_0
6222;2788429;Constitutive production of lymphokines by cloned murine B-cell lymphomas--CH12 B lymphoma produces interleukin-4.;B cells can be activated by T-independent antigens or mitogens such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) which will induce proliferation and differentiation of the B cells into Ig-secreting cells, without the intervention of T cells. The precise mechanism of T-independent proliferation and differentiation of B cells is still unclear. It is possible however that antigen-stimulated B cells may produce some factors which play a role in T-independent B-cell responses. In addition, since it has now been established that B cells can function as antigen-presenting cells, it is possible that they too secrete a molecule which is involved in the activation of T cells, analogous to IL-1 production by antigen-presenting macrophages. A number of human B-cell lines, as well as human normal B cells activated appropriately, have been shown to produce various cytokines, and similar studies are now being undertaken in the mouse. In the present study, six cloned murine B-cell lymphomas of different origin were analyzed for the presence of mRNA encoding a number of lymphokines by hybridization of specific cDNA probes to poly-A RNA, followed by the sensitive S1 nuclease digestion technique. The lymphokines included (IL-) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and neuroleukin. Whereas none of the lines expressed detectable levels of IL-2, IL-3, or IL-5 mRNA, all the lines expressed high levels of neuroleukin mRNA. Three of the lymphomas (CH12, CH31, and NBL) expressed low levels of IL-1 mRNA. The most striking finding was that one lymphoma, CH12, constitutively expressed IL-4 mRNA. This mRNA appeared to be functional, as IL-4 activity measured by the HT-2 T cell proliferation assay could be detected in supernatants collected from CH12 cells. The growth-inducing activity of CH12 supernatant on HT-2 cells could be completely blocked by an anti-IL-4 monoclonal (11B11), but not by an anti-IL-2 antibody (S4B6), consistent with our observations that CH12 cells produce IL-4 but not IL-2. CH12 cells were also found to express high affinity receptors for IL-4. Proliferation of CH12 cells was not affected by the addition of exogenous IL-4. Addition of anti-IL-4 antibodies to CH12 cells in culture caused a slight but reproducible increase in their proliferation at low cell numbers, which is probably not highly significant. These findings open the possibilities that murine B lymphocytes are capable of lymphokine production or alternatively that aberrant lymphokine production underlies B-lymphocyte transformation. ;polyalanine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

At times when ventricular tachycardia degenerated to ventricular fibrillation, asynchronous activation of the right bundle branch and the ventricular myocardium was frequently noted. Such asynchrony of activation was not seen during the spontaneous conversion of ventricular tachycardia to sinus rhythm. We suggest that this asynchronous activity produces increasing fractionation of ventricular activation fronts, which in turn yields fibrillation.;-;-;-;hard_0
6225;28035002;Structural Insights into c-Myc-interacting Zinc Finger Protein-1 (Miz-1) Delineate Domains Required for DNA Scanning and Sequence-specific Binding.;c-Myc-interacting zinc finger protein-1 (Miz-1) is a poly-Cys2His2 zinc finger (ZF) transcriptional regulator of many cell cycle genes. A Miz-1 DNA sequence consensus has recently been identified and has also unveiled Miz-1 functions in other cellular processes, underscoring its importance in the cell. Miz-1 contains 13 ZFs, but it is unknown why Miz-1 has so many ZFs and whether they recognize and bind DNA sequences in a typical fashion. Here, we used NMR to deduce the role of Miz-1 ZFs 1-4 in detecting the Miz-1 consensus sequence and preventing nonspecific DNA binding. In the construct containing the first 4 ZFs, we observed that ZFs 3 and 4 form an unusual compact and stable structure that restricts their motions. Disruption of this compact structure by an electrostatically mismatched A86K mutation profoundly affected the DNA binding properties of the WT construct.

6228;19154138;The proline-rich N-terminal sequence of calcineurin Abeta determines substrate binding.;Three different genes of catalytic subunit A of the Ca(2+)-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) are encoded in the human genome forming heterodimers with regulatory subunit B. Even though physiological roles of CaN have been investigated extensively, less is known about the specific functions of the different catalytic isoforms. In this study, all human CaN holoenzymes containing either the alpha, beta, or gamma isoform of the catalytic subunit (CaN alpha, beta, or gamma, respectively) were expressed for the first time. Comparative kinetic analysis of the dephosphorylation of five specific CaN substrates provided evidence that the distinct isoforms of the catalytic subunit confer substrate specificities to the holoenzymes. CaN alpha dephosphorylates the transcription factor Elk-1 with 7- and 2-fold higher catalytic efficiencies than the beta and gamma isoforms, respectively. CaN gamma exhibits the highest k(cat)/K(m) value for DARPP-32, whereas the catalytic efficiencies for the dephosphorylation of NFAT and RII peptide were 3- and 5-fold lower, respectively, when compared with the other isoforms. Elk-1 and NFAT reporter gene activity measurements revealed even more pronounced substrate preferences of CaNA isoforms. Moreover, kinetic analysis demonstrated that CaN beta exhibits for all tested protein substrates the lowest K(m) values. Enzymatic characterization of the CaN beta(P14G/P18G) variant as well as the N-terminal truncated form CaN beta(22-524) revealed that the proline-rich sequence of CaN beta is involved in substrate recognition. CaN beta(22-524) exhibits an at least 4-fold decreased substrate affinity and a 5-fold increased turnover number. Since this study demonstrates that all CaN isoforms display the same cytoplasmic subcellular distribution and are expressed in each tested cell line, differences in substrate specificities may determine specific physiological functions of the distinct isoforms. ;polyproline;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
6232;12535687;Design and construction of novel molecular conjugates for signal amplification (I): conjugation of multiple horseradish peroxidase molecules to immunoglobulin via primary amines on lysine peptide chains.;Immunoconjugates are widely used for indirect detection of analytes (such as antibodies or antigens) in a variety of immunoassays. However, the availability of functional groups such as primary amines or free sulfhydryls in an immunoglobulin molecule is the limiting factor for optimal conjugation and, therefore, determines the sensitivity of an assay. In the present study, an N-terminal bromoacetylated 20 amino acid peptide containing 20 lysine residues was conjugated to N-succinimidyl-S-acetylthioacetate (SATA)-modified IgG or free sulfhydryl groups on 2-mercaptoethylamine (2-MEA)-reduced IgG molecules via a thioether (S[bond]CH(2)CONH) linkage to introduce multiple reactive primary amines per IgG. These primary amines were then covalently coupled with maleimide-activated horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The poly-HRP-antibody conjugates thus generated demonstrated greater than 15-fold signal amplification upon reaction with orthophenyldiamine substrate. The poly-HRP-antibody conjugates efficiently detected human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 antibodies in plasma specimens with significantly higher sensitivity than conventionally prepared HRP-antibody conjugates in an HIV-1 solid-phase enzyme immunoassay and Western blot analysis. The signal amplification techniques reported here could have the potential for development of highly sensitive immunodiagnostic assay systems. ;polyhistidine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

A total of 153 (30.6%) out of 500 cDNA clones showed high amino acid identity to previously identified genes. There was significant redundancy in cDNAs encoding prolamine and glutelin. About 21.0% of the cDNA clones were found to code for seed storage protein genes. Consequently, 37 independent genes were identified. Using cDNA clones encoding glutelin, prolamine, seed allergen, alpha-1,4-glucan branching enzyme, glycine-rich RNA binding protein, metallothionein, non-specific lipid-transfer protein and ubiquitin conjugating enzyme the accumulation of mRNA during rice seed development was compared. Genes associated with seed storage protein and starch biosynthesis were expressed according to expected developmental stages.

6234;6610088;Profiles of antinuclear antibodies in chronic active hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis and alcoholic liver disease.;The profiles of specific antinuclear antibodies were determined in sera from 23 patients with the idiopathic type of chronic active hepatitis (CAH), 15 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and 25 patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD). The indirect immunofluorescence test for antinuclear antibodies using cultured human embryonic fibroblasts as substrate was positive in 78% in CAH, in 73% in PBC and in 24% in ALD. Seventeen percent of CAH sera and 33% of PBC sera stained small speckles in interphase nuclei. This staining pattern probably represents a new subset of ANA as the centromeres (kinetochores) were not stained. Antibodies to native DNA by the Crithidia luciliae test were found in only one serum from a patient with CAH. In addition, 17 percent of the CAH sera reacted with the saline extract of rabbit thymus by double immunodiffusion. Antibodies to the Sm- or RNP-antigens were not found. SS-B antibodies could be demonstrated in 39% of the CAH sera by a sensitive immunoenzymatic technique. Patients with CAH also had significantly higher levels of antibodies against denatured, single-stranded DNA (ss-DNA) and a synthetic RNA molecule, poly(A) as compared to other groups. Patients with an atypical cholestatic CAH had an antinuclear-antibody profile resembling that of the other CAH patients, but different from that of PBC patients. Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis had significantly higher levels of ss-DNA- and poly(A)-antibodies than other patients with ALD. It is concluded that the determination of an antinuclear-antibody profile using the ELISA seems to be clinically useful in the classification of chronic liver diseases. ;polyalanine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
6239;33467093;Regulation of Kv11.1 Isoform Expression by Polyadenylate Binding Protein Nuclear 1.;The Kv11.1 voltage-gated potassium channel, encoded by the KCNH2 gene, conducts the rapidly activating delayed rectifier current in the heart. KCNH2 pre-mRNA undergoes alternative polyadenylation to generate two C-terminal Kv11.1 isoforms in the heart. Utilization of a poly(A) signal in exon 15 produces the full-length, functional Kv11.1a isoform, while intron 9 polyadenylation generates the C-terminally truncated, nonfunctional Kv11.1a-USO isoform. The relative expression of Kv11.1a and Kv11.1a-USO isoforms plays an important role in the regulation of Kv11.1 channel function. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the RNA polyadenylate binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) interacts with a unique 22 nt adenosine stretch adjacent to the intron 9 poly(A) signal and regulates KCNH2 pre-mRNA alternative polyadenylation and the relative expression of Kv11.1a C-terminal isoforms. We showed that PABPN1 inhibited intron 9 poly(A) activity using luciferase reporter assays, tandem poly(A) reporter assays, and RNA pulldown assays. We also showed that PABPN1 increased the relative expression level of the functional Kv11.1a isoform using RNase protection assays, immunoblot analyses, and patch clamp recordings. Our present findings suggest a novel role for the RNA-binding protein PABPN1 in the regulation of functional and nonfunctional Kv11.1 isoform expression.;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

6242;8649414;A testis cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein that has the properties of a translational repressor.;Translation of the mouse protamine 1 (Prm-1) mRNA is repressed for several days during male germ cell differentiation. With the hope of cloning genes that regulate the translational repression of Prm-1, we screened male germ cell cDNA expression libraries with the 3' untranslated region of the Prm-1 RNA. From this screen we obtained two independent clones that encode Prbp, a Prm-1 RNA-binding protein. Prbp contains two copies of a double-stranded-RNA-binding domain. In vitro, the protein binds to a portion of the Prm-1 3' untranslated region previously shown to be sufficient for translational repression in transgenic mice, as well as to poly(I). poly(C). Prbp protein is present in multiple forms in cytoplasmic extracts prepared from wild-type mouse testes and is absent from testes of germ cell-deficient mouse mutants, suggesting that Prbp is restricted to the germ cells of the testis. Immunocytochemical localization confirmed that Prbp is present in the cytoplasmic compartment of late-stage meiotic cells and haploid round spermatids. Recombinant Prbp protein inhibits the translation of multiple mRNAs in a wheat germ lysate, suggesting that Prbp acts to repress translation in round spermatids. While this protein lacks complete specificity for Prm-1-containing RNAs in vitro, the properties of Prbp are consistent with it acting as a general repressor of translation. ;polycysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
6246;2205424;Inappropriately elevated plasma insulin-like growth factor II in relation to suppressed insulin-like growth factor I in the diagnosis of non-islet cell tumour hypoglycaemia.;The diagnosis of non-islet cell tumour (hypoinsulinaemic) hypoglycamia has been complicated by contradictory biochemical evidence. Although insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) has been identified as the hypoglycaemic agent, plasma levels are often not elevated. In this study specific radioimmunoassay procedures for the measurement of IGF-I and IGF-II are described. Reference data on plasma IGF-II concentrations in relation to a wide range of IGF-I levels have been accumulated using plasma samples from acromegalic, hypopituitary and insulinoma (i.e. hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia) patients as well as normal subjects from all age groups. The reference data indicate that a low plasma IGF-I value is normally associated with a relatively low plasma IGF-II level. Within a group of hypoinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia patients, a small number, invariably with evidence of a neoplasm, had low plasma IGF-I concentrations but apparently normal IGF-II levels. We propose that, in such cases, an apparently normal plasma IGF-II value is inappropriately high for the low plasma IGF-I level and, in association with non-ketotic hypoinsulinaemia and suppressed plasma growth hormone (GH), is diagnostic of a non-islet cell tumour as the cause of hypoglycaemia.;-;-;-;hard_0

The administration of 0.0001 M EDTA-Na2 provides the absence of RNA aggregation and prevents non-specific RNA binding on cellulose columns, which takes place when more high EDTA-Na2 concentrations in elution solutions are applied. Under these conditions synthetic polyA in model experiments practically completely binds with cellulose in a broad range of concentrations.

6257;8954967;Involvement of the homeodomain-containing transcription factor PDX-1 in islet amyloid polypeptide gene transcription.;"The AT-rich cis-motif A elements of the insulin gene promoter contribute to directing the gene's expression to pancreatic beta-cells, bound by a homeodomain-containing transcription factor, PDX-1/IPF1/STF-1/IDX-1. The islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP; amylin) gene, which is also expressed in limited tissues such as pancreatic beta- and delta-cells, contained similar AT-rich sequences in its regulatory sequences. To understand the molecular basis of IAPP gene regulation, we evaluated the possible physiological significance of the motif in human IAPP gene regulation. All of the three typical A element-like sequences that matched the CT-box consensus (AT-1, -207/-202; AT-2, -154/-142; and AT-3, -88/-83) were shown to bind specifically to a nuclear factor in the beta-cell-derived MIN6 cells, which was subsequently identified immunologically as the insulin gene transcription factor PDX-1. When the promoter activity was examined in MIN6 cells, the disruption of AT-1 or AT-3 but not of AT-2 caused a marked reduction in the IAPP gene promoter. Thus, despite the observation that all the three A element-like regions could bind to PDX-1, the AT-2 site may not be involved in mediating the PDX-1 action in vivo. These observations suggest the involvement of PDX-1 in human IAPP gene regulation, which seems to be mediated through at least two A element-like cis-motifs in the gene promoter.

6262;20408811;Temporal regulation of Cat-1 (cationic amino acid transporter-1) gene transcription during endoplasmic reticulum stress.;Expression of the Cat-1 gene (cationic amino acid transporter-1) is induced in proliferating cells and in response to a variety of stress conditions. The expression of the gene is mediated via a TATA-less promoter. In the present study we show that an Sp1 (specificity protein 1)-binding site within a GC-rich region of the Cat-1 gene controls its basal expression and is important for induction of the gene during the UPR (unfolded protein response). We have shown previously that induction of Cat-1 gene expression during the UPR requires phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2alpha (eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha) by PERK (protein-kinase-receptor-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase), one of the signalling pathways activated during the UPR. This leads to increased translation of the transcription factor ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4). We also show that a second signalling pathway is required for sustained transcriptional induction of the Cat-1 gene during the UPR, namely activation of IRE1 (inositol-requiring enzyme 1) leading to alternative splicing of the mRNA for the transcription factor XBP1 (X-box-binding protein 1). The resulting XBP1s (spliced XBP1) can bind to an ERSE (endoplasmic-reticulum-stress-response-element), ERSE-II-like, that was identified within the Cat-1 promoter. Surprisingly, eIF2alpha phosphorylation is required for accumulation of XBP1s. We propose that the signalling via phosphorylated eIF2alpha is required for maximum induction of Cat-1 transcription during the UPR by inducing the accumulation of both ATF4 and XBP1s. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
6264;24022462;An improved AMBER force field for α,α-dialkylated peptides: intrinsic and solvent-induced conformational preferences of model systems.;α,α-Dialkylated amino acid residues have acquired considerable importance as effective means for introducing backbone conformation constraints in synthetic peptides. The prototype of such a class of residues, namely Aib (α-aminoisobutyric acid), appears to play a dominant role in determining the preferred conformations of host proteins. We have recently introduced into the standard AMBER force field some new parameters, fitted against high-level quantum mechanical (QM) data, for simulating peptides containing α,α-dialkylated residues with cyclic side chains, such as TOAC (TOAC, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl-4-amino-4-carboxylic acid) and Ac6c (Ac6c = 1-aminocyclohexaneacetic acid). Here, we show that in order to accurately reproduce the observed conformational geometries and structural fluctuations of linear α,α-dialkylated peptides based on Aib, further improvements of the non-bonding and side chain torsion potential parameters have to be considered, due to the expected larger structural flexibility of linear residues with respect to cyclic ones. To this end, we present an extended set of parameters, which have been optimized by fitting the energies of multiple conformations of the Aib dipeptide analogue to corresponding QM calculations that properly account for dispersion interactions (B3LYP-D3). The quality, transferability and size-consistency of the proposed force field have been assessed both by considering a series of poly-Aib peptides, modeled at the same QM level, and by performing molecular dynamics simulations in solvents with high and low polarity. As a result, the present parameters allow one to reproduce with good reliability the available QM and experimental data, thus representing a notable improvement over current force field especially in the description of the α/310-helix conformational equilibria of α,α-dialkylated peptides with linear and cyclic side chains.  ;polyalanine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
6268;9488410;Characterization of a Chlamydia psittaci DNA binding protein (EUO) synthesized during the early and middle phases of the developmental cycle.;The EUO gene (for early upstream open reading frame) of Chlamydia psittaci was previously found to be transcribed better at 1 than at 24 h postinfection. We found that the EUO gene encodes a minor protein that is expressed within 1 h of infection of host cells with C. psittaci 6BC but that protein quantity peaks during the logarithmic growth phase of reticulate bodies (RBs), declines late in the infection (after 20 h) when RBs reorganize into elementary bodies (EBs), and is absent in infectious EBs. EUO protein lacks homology to known proteins but does contain a putative helix-turn-helix motif. We found that recombinant EUO binds to DNA in vitro with a relatively broad specificity. Using the bp -200 to +67 promoter region of the cysteine-rich envelope protein (crp) operon as a model, we show that EUO protein preferentially binds to AT-rich sequences and protects crp DNA from DNase I from approximately bp -60 to -9. We also found that native EUO protein in extracts of RBs binds to the promoter region of the crp operon, demonstrating that the DNA binding property of EUO protein is not an artifact of recombinant methods. Although EUO protein appears to bind to the crp operon with high affinity in vitro (Kd of about 15 nM), it is not known whether the protein binds the crp DNA in vivo. ;polycysteine;helix;-;LCR_with_function

Here, we show that the yeast prion [SWI(+)] abolishes flocculin (FLO) gene expression and results in a complete loss of multicellularity. Further investigation demonstrates that besides Swi1, multiple other proteins essential for FLO expression, including Mss11, Sap30, and Msn1 also undergo conformational changes and become inactivated in [SWI(+)] cells. Moreover, the asparagine-rich region of Mss11 can exist as prion-like aggregates specifically in [SWI(+)] cells, which are SDS resistant, heritable, and curable, but become metastable after separation from [SWI(+)]. Our findings thus reveal a prion-mediated mechanism through which multiple regulators in a biological pathway can be inactivated. In combination with the partial loss-of-function phenotypes of [SWI(+)] cells on non-glucose sugar utilization, our data therefore demonstrate that a prion can influence distinct traits differently through multi-level regulations, providing insights into the biological roles of prions.  ;polyasparagine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

This organism is intrinsically resistant to several clinically relevant antibiotics and can transfer resistance to other pathogens. Although E. faecalis has emerged as a major nosocomial pathogen, the mechanisms underlying the virulence of this organism remain elusive. We studied the regulation of daughter cell separation during growth and explored the impact of this process on pathogenesis. We demonstrate that the activity of the AtlA peptidoglycan hydrolase, an enzyme dedicated to septum cleavage, is controlled by several mechanisms, including glycosylation and recognition of the peptidoglycan substrate. We show that the long cell chains of E. faecalis mutants are more susceptible to phagocytosis and are no longer able to cause lethality in the zebrafish model of infection. Altogether, this work indicates that control of cell separation during division underpins the pathogenesis of E. faecalis infections and represents a novel enterococcal virulence factor. We propose that inhibition of septum cleavage during division represents an attractive therapeutic strategy to control infections.;-;-;-;hard_0

6286;31919387;Interferon mediated neuroinflammation in polyglutamine disease is not caused by RNA toxicity.;Polyglutamine diseases are neurodegenerative diseases that occur due to the expansion of CAG repeat regions in coding sequences of genes. Previously, we have shown the formation of large protein aggregates along with activation of the interferon pathway leading to apoptosis in a cellular model of SCA17. Here, we corroborate our previous results in a tetracycline-inducible model of SCA17. Interferon gamma and lambda were upregulated in 59Q-TBP expressing cells as compared to 16Q-TBP expressing cells. Besides interferon-stimulated genes, the SCA17 model and Huntington's mice brain samples showed upregulation of RNA sensors. However, in this improved model interferon pathway activation and apoptosis preceded the formation of large polyglutamine aggregates, suggesting a role for CAG repeat RNA or soluble protein aggregates. A polyglutamine minus mutant of TBP, expressing polyCAG mRNA, was created by site directed mutagenesis of 10 potential start codons. Neither this long CAG embedded mRNA nor short polyCAG RNA could induce interferon pathway genes or cause apoptosis. polyQ-TBP induced the expression of canonical RNA sensors but the downstream transcription factor, IRF3, showed a muted response. We found that expanded CAG repeat RNA is not sufficient to account for the neuronal apoptosis. Neuronal cells sense expanded CAG repeats embedded in messenger RNAs of protein-coding genes. However, polyglutamine containing protein is responsible for the interferon-mediated neuroinflammation and cell death seen in polyglutamine disease. Thus, we delineate the inflammatory role of CAG repeats in the mRNA from the resulting polyglutamine tract in the protein. Embedded in messenger RNAs of protein-coding regions, the cell senses CAG repeat expansion and induces the expression of RNA sensors and interferon-stimulated genes.;polyglutamine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

A crystal structure of FBPase in a complex with three zinc cations and the products fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) and phosphate (Pi) reveals loop 52-72 for the first time in a well-defined conformation with strong electron density.

Leu56 and Tyr57 of the loop pack against hydrophobic residues from two separate subunits of FBPase. A mechanism of allosteric regulation of catalysis is presented, in which AMP, by binding to its allosteric pocket, displaces loop 52-72 from the active site. Furthermore, the current structure suggests that both the alpha- and beta-anomers of F6P can be substrates in the reverse reaction catalyzed by FBPase. Mechanisms of catalysis are proposed for the reverse reaction in which Asp121 serves as a catalytic base for the alpha-anomer and Glu280 serves as a catalytic base for the beta-anomer.;-;-;-;hard_0

These items were evaluated using a five-point Likert scale covering the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2). The data was analyzed using covariance-based structural equation modeling. About 47% of consumers use FDA weekly. The continuance intention of FDA during the pandemic in Brazil was affected by performance expectancy (β = 0.496; p < 0.001), social influence (β = 0.094; p < 0.001), hedonic motivation (β = 0.068; p = 0.026), price value (β = 0.103; p < 0.001), habit (β = 0.305; p < 0.001), frequency of using FDA (β = 0.051; p = 0.039), and solidarity with the foodservice sector (β = 0.090; p < 0.001). It was also observed that the continuance intention reduces risk perception (β = -0.403; p < 0.001), and risk perception reduces the frequency of using FDA (β = -0.178; p < 0.001). The results indicate that the UTAUT2 strongly explains consumers' continuance intention. Differences in path estimates among Brazilian regions were observed, indicating some regional differences. It was possible to observe a tendency of using FDA during and after the pandemic, motivated by several factors. The FDA developers and foodservice managers could use this data to improve their services.

6302;33310187;A novel protein-engineered dsDNA-binding protein (HU-Simulacrum) inspired by HU, a nucleoid-associated DNABII protein.;HU, a DNA-binding protein, has a helical N-terminal region (NTR) of ∼44 residues and a beta strand- and IDR-rich C-terminal region (CTR) of ∼46 residues. CTR binds to DNA through (i) a clasp (two arginine/lysine-rich, IDR-rich beta hairpins that bind to phosphate groups in the minor groove), (ii) a flat surface (comprising four antiparallel beta strands that abut the major groove), and (iii) a charge cluster (two lysine residues upon a short C-terminal helix). HU forms a dimer displaying extensive inter-subunit CTR-CTR contacts. A single-chain simulacrum of these contacts (HU-Simul) incorporating all DNA-binding elements was created by fusing together the CTRs of Escherichia coli HU-A and Thermus thermophilus HU. HU-Simul is monomeric, binds to dsDNA and cruciform DNA, but not to ssDNA.;polyarginine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
6308;9317019;Aggregative adherence fimbria II, a second fimbrial antigen mediating aggregative adherence in enteroaggregative Escherichia coli.;Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) has been implicated as an agent of pediatric diarrhea in the developing world. We have shown previously that EAEC adheres to HEp-2 cells by virtue of a plasmid-encoded fimbrial adhesin designated aggregative adherence fimbria I (AAF/I), the genes for which have been cloned and sequenced. However, not all EAEC strains express AAF/I. Using TnphoA mutagenesis, we have characterized a novel fimbria (designated AAF/II) which mediates HEp-2 adherence of the human-pathogenic strain 042. AAF/II is 5 nm in diameter and does not bind AAF/I antiserum, as determined by immunogold transmission electron microscopy. TnphoA identified a gene (designated aafA) which bears significant homology to aggA, the fimbrial subunit of AAF/I (25% identity and 47% similarity at the amino acid level). When hyperexpressed and purified by polyhistidine tagging, the AafA protein assembled into 5-nm-diameter filaments which bound anti-AAF/II antiserum. The cloned aafA gene complemented a mutation in the aggA gene to confer fimbrial expression from the AAF/I gene cluster, manifesting phenotypes characteristic of AAF/II but not AAF/I. The aafA mutant did not adhere to human intestinal tissue in culture, suggesting a role for AAF/II in intestinal colonization. By using DNA probes for AAF/I and AAF/II derived from fimbrial biosynthesis genes, we show that AAF/I and AAF/II are each found in only a minority of EAEC strains, suggesting that still more EAEC adhesins exist. Our data suggest that AAF adhesins represent a new family of fimbrial adhesins which mediate aggregative adherence in EAEC.;polyhistidine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
6311;6169799;Interactions between polymerized human albumin, hepatitis B surface antigen, and complement: I. Binding of polyalbumin to Clq.;"There is considerable evidence that substances other than immunoglobulins can bind human Clq. Utilizing purified human Clq immobilized on polystyrene beads, we have demonstrated that polymerized human albumin (PHALB-125I) binds to human Clq in a direct binding assay. This interaction required a high degree of albumin polymerization as the percentage of binding was proportional to the polymer size and monomeric albumin was unreactive. Binding was species specific in the human Clq bound only human, and not xenogeneic, polyalbumins. Similarly, polymers of various other human plasma proteins were unreactive. To demonstrate that this interaction was not unique to immobilized Clq, soluble Clq was shown to inhibit PHALB-125I binding to solid phase Clq. Because aggregated IgG, poly(I):poly(C), dextran sulfate, polyglutamic acid, and polylysine have been previously shown to bind Clq, we used them in further blocking experiments and found them also to inhibit the interaction between Clq and PHALB. Anti-human Clq and, to a lesser extent, anti-PHALB antibodies inhibited the interaction. The Clq-PHALB binding was pH, ionic strength, and temperature dependent. In addition, human Clq was not observed to bind hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) directly; however, in the presence of sufficiently polymerized human albumin a Clq-PHALB-HBsAg complex was formed. These interactions may be implicated in hepatocyte-HBsAg receptor function as well as in the host defense mechanisms involved in hepatitis B virus infection. ";polylysine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
6315;29641184;Access to Household Water Quality Information Leads to Safer Water: A Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial in india.;"Household-specific feedback on the microbiological safety of drinking water may result in changes to water management practices that reduce exposure risks. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial in India to determine if information on household drinking water quality could change behavior and improve microbiological quality as indicated by Escherichia coli counts. We randomly assigned 589 participating households to one of three arms: (1) a messaging-only arm receiving messaging on safe water management ( n = 237); (2) a standard testing arm receiving the same messaging plus laboratory E. coli testing results specific to that household's drinking water ( n = 173); and (3) a test kit arm receiving messaging plus low-cost E. coli tests that could be used at the household's discretion ( n = 179). Self-reported water treatment increased significantly in both the standard testing arm and the test kit arm between baseline and follow-up one month later. Mean log10 E. coli counts per 100 mL in household stored drinking water increased in the messaging-only arm from 1.42 to 1.87, while decreasing in the standard testing arm (1.38 to 0.89, 65% relative reduction) and the test kit arm (1.08 to 0.65, 76% relative reduction). Findings indicate that household-specific water quality information can improve both behaviors and drinking water quality.";-;-;-;hard_0

The authors analyze the ecologic conditions conducive to dissemination of cercariasis in 17 natural and artificial water bodies of Moscow and the Moscow region. They point out that high contamination of the water bodies with organic communal wastes and an abundant overgrowth of macrophytes favor the development of molluscs, intermediate hosts of Schistosoma, and promote the increase of the populations thereof. High number of Lymnaea ovata, L. auticularia, L. stagnalis, Planorbarius corneus, P. planorbis, Anisus sp. were found invaded with Trichobilharzia ocellata (up to 50%) and Bilharziella polonica (as much as 10%). A lot of ducks, end hosts of Schistosoma, were found at all the examined water bodies. in 30% of the examined water bodies the risk of human infection was found high.

6322;8206682;Caffeine attenuates the action of amsacrine and etoposide in U-937 cells by mechanisms which involve inhibition of RNA synthesis.;"Pulse treatments of U-937 human promonocytic leukemia cells with the DNA topoisomerase-II inhibitors 4'-(9-acridynilamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide (amsacrine, mAMSA) or etoposide (VP-16) caused growth inhibition, G2-arrest, increase in cell size and expression of differentiation markers. All these effects were greatly reduced by the presence of 5-10 mM caffeine. In addition, caffeine partially prevented the increase in the number of topoisomerase-DNA cleavable complexes caused by the topoisomerase inhibitors, as determined by SDS/CIK precipitation assays; it caused chromatin condensation, as determined by flow cytometry assays, and interacted with mAMSA in solution, as suggested by spectrophotometric assays. Pulse treatment with caffeine greatly inhibited RNA synthesis but not DNA or protein synthesis, as indicated by labelled precursor incorporation assays. The transcription inhibitor 5,6-dichloro-I-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzymidazole reduced the mAMSA- and VP-16-produced growth inhibition in a similar manner. It is concluded that RNA synthesis inhibition is one of the possible mechanisms by which caffeine protects cells from the action of topoisomerase-II inhibitors.";-;-;-;hard_0
6326;8194163;Renal and hepatic toxicity after high-dose 7-hydroxymethotrexate in the rat.;To examine directly the hepatic and renal toxicity of 7-hydroxymethotrexate (7-OH-MTX) without interference of the parent compound methotrexate (MTX), we purified and gave 100 mg/kg 7-OH-MTX to rats, a dose resulting in serum levels of 7-OH-MTX comparable with those achieved in the clinic after the administration of high-dose MTX (HD-MTX). After only 5 h, the 7-OH-MTX-treated rats demonstrated 2.6-fold increases in serum creatinine values and 2-fold elevations in serum aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) levels as compared with the controls. Morphologic evidence of toxicity, however, was apparent only in the kidneys. Intraluminal cellular debris containing membranous material and deteriorated organelles was seen, but no precipitate of the delivered drug. The peak serum concentration of 7-OH was up to 939 microM, and concentrations of 7-OH-MTX declined triphasically, showing a t1/2 alpha value of 2.45 min, a t1/2 beta value of 30.5 min, and a terminal half-life (t1/2 gamma) of 240 min. The total clearance value was 14.5 ml min-1 kg, and the postdistributional volume of distribution (V beta) was 5070 ml/kg.

6328;15731042;Citrobacter rodentium lifA/efa1 is essential for colonic colonization and crypt cell hyperplasia in vivo.;Previously, we have identified a large gene (lifA, for lymphocyte inhibitory factor A) in enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) encoding a protein termed lymphostatin that suppresses cytokine expression in vitro. This protein also functions as an adhesion factor for enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli and is alternatively known as efa1 (EHEC factor for adherence 1). The lifA/efa1 gene is also present in Citrobacter rodentium, an enteric pathogen that causes a disease termed transmissible murine colonic hyperplasia (TMCH), which induces colitis and massive crypt cell proliferation, in mice. To determine if lifA/efa1 is required for C. rodentium-induced colonic pathology in vivo, three in-frame mutations were generated, disrupting the glycosyltransferase (GlM12) and protease (PrMC31) motifs and a domain in between that does not encode any known activity (EID3). In contrast to infection with wild-type C. rodentium, that with any of the lifA/efa1 mutant strains did not induce weight loss or TMCH. Enteric infection with motif mutants GlM12 and PrM31 resulted in significantly reduced colonization counts during the entire 20-day course of infection. In contrast, EID3 was indistinguishable from the wild type during the initial colonic colonization, but cleared rapidly after day 8 of the infection. The colonic epithelium of all infected mice displayed increased epithelial regeneration. However, significantly increased regeneration was observed by day 20 only in mice infected with the wild-type in comparison to those infected with lifA/efa1 mutant EID3. In summary, lifA/efa1 is a critical gene outside the locus for enterocyte effacement that regulates bacterial colonization, crypt cell proliferation, and epithelial cell regeneration.;-;-;-;hard_0
6340;7124402;Enterotoxin production at 4 degrees, 22 degrees, and 37 degrees C and Y. enterocolitica-like bacteria.;Production of heat-stable enterotoxin after cultivation at 4 degrees C for four days was indicated for 27 of 171 Yersinia enterocolitica and Y. enterocolitica-like bacteria, using the infant mouse assay. Of these 27 strains, 11 showed enterotoxin production at both 4 degrees and 22 degrees C, and the remaining 16 strains at 4 degrees, 22 degrees, and 37 degrees C. No strain was enterotoxigenic at 4 degrees C only. The relative prevalence of enterotoxin production at 4 degrees, 22 degrees, and 37 degrees C among Y. enterocolitica and Y. enterocolitica-like bacteria is presented. The results indicate that Y. kristensenii has a unique standing with respect to enterotoxigenicity at 4 degrees and at 37 degrees C. Y. kristensenii showed the highest prevalence of enterotoxin production at 4 degrees C (47%) and at 37 degrees C(49%). These properties were also recorded among environmental isolates of Y. enterocolitica sensu stricto, but the prevalences were low (4 and 1 %, respectively). The strains producing enterotoxin at 4 degrees C were different from those associated with yersiniosis and belonged to serogroups frequently isolated from small mammals, water, and soil (0:1, 6, 11, 12, 16, 28, and non-agglutinable). It is possible that such strains may contaminate foods and provoke food-borne intoxication involving pre-formed enterotoxins.;-;-;-;hard_0
6341;9359528;Primary familial polycythaemia associated with a novel point mutation in the erythropoietin receptor.;Primary familial and congenital polycythaemia (PFCP) is a rare disease characterized by congenital erythrocytosis inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Recently, mutations in the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) have been identified in PFCP families. We describe a Japanese family with an autosomal dominant inheritance of PFCP. An in vitro colony assay demonstrated hypersensitivity of erythroid progenitors to erythropoietin (Epo) in affected family members. Sequence analysis of RT-PCR products amplified from the C-terminal region of EpoR transcripts in affected family members revealed that they were all heterozygous for C and T bases at position 5986, which suggested a genetic mutation (C to T) on one allele of EpoR. This mutation gave rise to a translation termination codon TAG at amino acid 435. Thus, the resulting EpoR is a truncated protein product lacking all 74 amino acids downstream of the mutation. To date, all genetic mutations affecting a family with PFCP, including this one, have been located in the cytoplasmic negative regulatory region of the EpoR. All mutations gave rise to truncated Epo receptors between Tyrosine 427 and Tyrosine 455. The phosphotyrosines in this region of EpoR have been demonstrated to be binding sites for SHP-1 phosphatase. Therefore PFCP is presumably brought about as a result of genetic mutations which cause the loss of the SHP-1 binding site in the cytoplasmic region of EpoR.;-;-;-;hard_0
6344;8600395;Selection of RNA-binding peptides in vivo.;Many priniciples of sequence-specific DNA recognition have been established over the past decade, largely from structural studies of protein-DNA and drug-DNA complexes. On the basis of these principles, it has been possible to design or select variants of known structural motifs, including zinc-fingers and minor groove-binding drugs, that bind desired sequences. Here we describe a strategy, based on transcriptional termination in bacteria, to identify specific RNA-binding peptides using the arginine-rich RNA-binding motif as a framework. Peptides were isolated from two combinatorial libraries that bind tightly and specifically to the Rev response element of HIV. It appears that alpha-helical peptides resembling Rev were selected from one library whereas new peptides that probably do not form helices were selected from the other, suggesting that the arginine-rich motif may be a particularly versatile framework for recognizing RNA structures. ;polyarginine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
6350;25836208;Efficient hyperconcentration of nonlocal multipartite entanglement via the cross-Kerr nonlinearity.;We propose two schemes for concentration of hyperentanglement of nonlocal multipartite states which are simultaneously entangled in the polarization and spatial modes. One scheme uses an auxiliary single-photon state prepared according to the parameters of the less-entangled states. The other scheme uses two less-entangled states with unknown parameters to distill the maximal hyperentanglement. The procrustean concentration is realized by two parity check measurements in both the two degrees of freedom. Nondestructive quantum nondemolition detectors based on cross-Kerr nonlinearity are used to implement the parity check, which makes the unsuccessful instances reusable in the next concentration round. The success probabilities in both schemes can be made to approach unity by iteration. Moreover, in both schemes only one of the N parties has to perform the parity check measurements. Our schemes are efficient and useful for quantum information processing involving hyperentanglement.;-;-;-;hard_0
6354;9756693;Establishment of a simple cleanup procedure and bioassay for determining 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin toxicity equivalents of environmental samples.;"The study was aimed at establishing a bioassay for the determination of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin toxicity equivalents (TEQs) in environmental samples. Specifically, development of a rapid cleanup procedure adapted to the needs of the bioassay and simplification of the measurement of its endpoint, the induction of 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) in rat H4IIEC3/T hepatoma cells, were desired. The results indicate that a single ""sandwich"" column suffices to remove substances that may interfere with the bioassay from extracts of various environmental matrices such as sewage sludge, compost, soil, sediment, fly ash, tissue filter dust, and fire residue. The cumbersome conventional in vitro assay for EROD activity on cells exposed to the test material in culture plates could readily be replaced by a simple assay on intact cells grown and treated in 96-well microtiter plates. TEQ values obtained from the bioassays were consistently higher than those derived from chemical analysis of dibenzo-p-dioxins/furans and biphenyls by a factor of 1.5-3.0 depending on the matrix used. The results indicate that this bioassay, which combines a simple cleanup and a rapid procedure for measuring biological effects, offers a cost- and time-effective alternative to chemical analysis when screening large numbers of samples from complex environmental matrices.";-;-;-;hard_0

6358;1570293;Folding and function of a T4 lysozyme containing 10 consecutive alanines illustrate the redundancy of information in an amino acid sequence.;"Single and multiple Xaa----Ala substitutions were constructed in the alpha-helix comprising residues 39-50 in bacteriophage T4 lysozyme. The variant with alanines at 10 consecutive positions (A40-49) folds normally and has activity essentially the same as wild type, although it is less stable. The crystal structure of this polyalanine mutant displays no significant change in the main-chain atoms of the helix when compared with the wild-type structure. The individual substitutions of the solvent-exposed residues Asn-40, Ser-44, and Glu-45 with alanine tend to increase the thermostability of the protein, whereas replacements of the buried or partially buried residues Lys-43 and Leu-46 are destabilizing. The melting temperature of the lysozyme in which Lys-43 and Leu-46 are retained and positions 40, 44, 45, 47, and 48 are substituted with alanine (i.e., A40-42/44-45/47-49) is increased by 3.1 degrees C relative to wild type at pH 3.0, but reduced by 1.6 degrees C at pH 6.7. In the case of the charged amino acids Glu-45 and Lys-48, the changes in melting temperature indicate that the putative salt bridge between these two residues contributes essentially nothing to the stability of the protein. The results clearly demonstrate that there is considerable redundancy in the sequence information in the polypeptide chain; not every amino acid is essential for folding. Also, further evidence is provided that the replacement of fully solvent-exposed residues within alpha-helices with alanines may be a general way to increase protein stability. The general approach may permit a simplification of the protein folding problem by retaining only amino acids proven to be essential for folding and replacing the remainder with alanine."; polyalanine ;helix;-;LCR_with_function
6359;22684686;Brain pathology of spinocerebellar ataxias.;The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) represent a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative diseases with progressive ataxia and cerebellar degeneration. The current classification of this disease group is based on the underlying genetic defects and their typical disease courses. According to this categorization, ADCAs are divided into the spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) with a progressive disease course, and the episodic ataxias (EA) with episodic occurrences of ataxia. The prominent disease symptoms of the currently known and genetically defined 31 SCA types result from damage to the cerebellum and interconnected brain grays and are often accompanied by more specific extra-cerebellar symptoms. In the present review, we report the genetic and clinical background of the known SCAs and present the state of neuropathological investigations of brain tissue from SCA patients in the final disease stages. Recent findings show that the brain is commonly seriously affected in the polyglutamine SCAs (i.e. SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, and SCA17) and that the patterns of brain damage in these diseases overlap considerably in patients suffering from advanced disease stages. In the more rarely occurring non-polyglutamine SCAs, post-mortem neuropathological data currently are scanty and investigations have been primarily performed in vivo by means of MRI brain imaging. Only a minority of SCAs exhibit symptoms and degenerative patterns allowing for a clear and unambiguous diagnosis of the disease, e.g. retinal degeneration in SCA7, tau aggregation in SCA11, dentate calcification in SCA20, protein depositions in the Purkinje cell layer in SCA31, azoospermia in SCA32, and neurocutaneous phenotype in SCA34. The disease proteins of polyglutamine ataxias and some non-polyglutamine ataxias aggregate as cytoplasmic or intranuclear inclusions and serve as morphological markers. Although inclusions may impair axonal transport, bind transcription factors, and block protein quality control, detailed molecular and pathogenetic consequences remain to be determined. ;polyglutamine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

Membrane removal was evaluated by electron microscopy of worms and bilayer material, using Con A-ferritin as a marker for the outer bilayer. Amounts of Con A removed by the digests were measured with a tritiated Con A marker. To measure the purity of the fractions membrane markers were characterised and quantitated for both bilayers. In the absence of the usual enzymatic markers for plasma membrane diazotised [125I]-iodosulfanilic acid was used as a marker for the outer bilayer. Alkaline phosphatase and a Na+, Mg2+-ATPase were localised to the inner bilayer. From these results we can deduce that the inner bilayer is analogous to the typical, apical plasma membrane of other animal epithelia. The outer bilayer does not share these enzymatic similarities. The integrity of the syncytium after removal of the outer bilayer and the increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase in the supernatant after removal of the inner bilayer suggests that the outer bilayer is secondary in maintaining the permeability barrier of the apical membrane complex, with respect to soluble proteins. The possible significance of these results in terms of the destructive action of complement on the parasite are discussed.;-;-;-;hard_0
