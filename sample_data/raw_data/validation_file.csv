4;1747160;The mouse proline-rich protein MP6 promoter binds isoprenaline-inducible parotid nuclear proteins via a highly conserved NFkB/rel-like site.;Proline-rich protein (PRP) gene MP6 was isolated from a mouse BALB/c genomic DNA library in lambda EMBL3, characterised by hybridisation and restriction mapping and the promoter region, from -162 to +72 around the PRP consensus cap-site, was sequenced. In gel shift assays this region formed complexes C1 and C2 with parotid nuclear proteins which were induced by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline. DNA competition studies and direct binding assays of promoter subfragments showed that it was the sequence from -157 to -91 that was forming the isoprenaline-dependent complexes. All PRP genes conserve a 23bp. sequence, termed PRP Box1, with ets and NFkB/rel binding site-like elements, upstream of their promoters. In the MP6 promoter, PRP Box1 was within the region forming the complexes. Further gel shift assays using PRP Box1 oligonucleotides as competitors and targets indicated that the NFkB/rel binding site-like element was important in formation of the isoprenaline-inducible complexes. HeLa nuclear extracts also formed complexes with PRP Box1 similar to C1 and C2 but nuclear extracts from spleen, submandibular gland and liver did not. These complexes are thus candidate regulators for the isoprenaline-dependent and tissue-specific transcription of PRP genes.;polyproline;-;-;LCR_without_function
5;1651933;Purification and characterization of a protein tyrosine phosphatase which dephosphorylates the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.;"The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is phosphorylated to a high stoichiometry on tyrosine residues both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, tyrosine phosphorylation has been shown to regulate the functional properties of the receptor. We report here the purification and characterization of a protein tyrosine phosphatase that dephosphorylates tyrosine-phosphorylated nAChR from Torpedo electroplax, a tissue highly enriched in the nAChR. The 32P-labeled tyrosine phosphorylated nAChR was used as a substrate to monitor the enzyme activity during purification. The protein tyrosine phosphatase activity was purified using three consecutive cation-exchange columns (phosphocellulose, S Sepharose Fast Flow, Bio-Rex 70), followed by two affinity matrices (p-aminobenzylphosphonic acid-agarose and thiophosphotyrosyl nAChR-Sepharose 4B). The enzyme activity was purified to homogeneity, with an overall purification of 25,000-fold and a yield of 20%. The purified enzyme had an apparent molecular mass of 43 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and migrated as a monomer during Superose 12 chromatography. It had a neutral pH optimum and a specific activity of 18 mumol/mg of protein/min, with a Km of 4.7 microM for tyrosine-phosphorylated nAChR. The phosphatase was specific for tyrosine phosphorylated nAChR; it showed no activity towards the nAChR phosphorylated on serine residues by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The enzyme also dephosphorylated 32P-labeled poly(Glu-Tyr) (4:1). However, it did not dephosphorylate p-nitrophenylphosphate. The tyrosine phosphatase was inhibited by ammonium molybdate (IC50 of 2 microM), sodium vanadate (IC50 of 150 microM) and the divalent cations Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ca2+ at millimolar concentrations, but not by 100 microM ZnCl or 10 mM NaF. Poly-(Glu, Tyr) (4:1) and heparin inhibited the enzyme activity at micromolar concentrations. These unique properties of the purified enzyme suggest that it may be a novel protein tyrosine phosphatase that specifically dephosphorylates the nAChR.";-;phosphatase activity;polyacrylamide;hard_3
9;1752071;A membranous nephropathy associated with adult polycystic kidney disease.;A 53-year-old woman with adult polycystic kidney disease (PKD) developed a nephrotic syndrome. Evaluation of the renal biopsy specimens showed typical findings of membranous nephropathy (MN). There are few reports of nephrotic syndrome associated with PKD and only one proved to be MN. The possible mechanism of the association of PKD with MN was evaluated. Autoantibodies against the brush border were not detected in this patient's serum by indirect immunofluorescence. Three monoclonal antibodies against the tubular brush border and epithelial cell of distal tubulus did not react with subepithelial deposits in the biopsy specimen. Therefore tubular brush border antigen which was reported to induce membranous nephropathy was not detected in the immune complexes deposited in the glomeruli. So we could not determine any direct relationship between PKD and MN. The reaction of antibodies against basement membrane components (type IV collagen, laminin, fibronectin, heparansulfate proteoglycan) with the basement membranes of the cysts was evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence. The reaction with anti-heparansulfate proteoglycan antibody was decreased compared with normal tubular basement membrane. The reactivity to anti-fibronectin antibody was remarkably increased in the cystic walls, tubules, and interstitium. Changes of tubular basement membrane antigens was observed in PKD.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
12;314311;A novel lymphocyte differentiating factor in serum of patients with mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome.;Sera from 13 patients with mycosis fungoides and 2 with Sezary syndrome were tested for activity that induces lymphocyte differentiation. Induction of Thy-1.2 antigen and surface immunoglobulin were used, respectively, to measure T- and B-cell differentiation. The indicator cells were null lymphocytes from the spleens of congenitally athymic nude mice. Normal serum induced some T-cell but no B-cell differentiation. The T-cell-inducing activity was ascribed to thymic hormone and declined with advancing age. A totally different pattern emerged with patient serum. T-cell-inducing activity was significantly more active than in normal serum (p less than 0.001). This activity did not decline with advancing age and was not inhibited by a concentration of ubiquitin, which blocks nonspecific beta-adrenergic induction. B-cell-inducing activity was also present. This novel serum factor (or factors) is a potent inducer of T- and B-lymphocyte differentiation and is associated with neoplastic lymphoproliferation of the T-cell series.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
18;3366494;Enzymatic elimination of O6-ethylguanine from the DNA of ethylnitrosourea-exposed normal and malignant rat brain cells grown under cell culture versus in vivo conditions.;The developing rat brain exhibits a pronounced susceptibility to the tumorigenic effect of ethylnitrosourea (EtNU) and an extremely low repair activity for the DNA alkylation product O6-ethylguanine (O6-EtGuar-). We have recently found that a collection of malignant neural cell lines originating from prenatal BDIX-rat brain cells were all highly O6-EtGua repair-proficient (O6-EtGuar+). Subcloned lines showed considerable variability of the repair capacity, suggesting instability of the O6-EtGua repair phenotype. Using one of the subcloned lines (BT3Caf) as a model, we show here that BT3Caf cells grown in monolayer culture repair O6-EtGua much more rapidly than those grown in the form of s.c. tumors in BDIX-rats (whereas O4-ethylthymine is not repaired under either condition). Furthermore, normal prenatal BDIX-rat brain cells (O6-EtGuar- in vivo) gradually acquire an O6-EtGuar+ phenotype upon transfer to long-term monolayer culture. The cellular capacity for enzymatic DNA repair is of particular relevance in relation to both the malignant transformation of normal cells and the therapeutic inactivation of cancer cells by DNA-reactive drugs. Further analyses are thus required of the molecular mechanisms controlling the expression of DNA repair enzymes as a function of cell differentiation, in terms of the cellular response to altered microenvironmental conditions, and in search for possibilities to reduce the repair capacity of cancer cells.;-;-;-;hard_0
20;30621181;A Multi-User Personal Indoor Localization System Employing Graph-Based Optimization.;Personal indoor localization with smartphones is a well-researched area, with a number of approaches solving the problem separately for individual users. Most commonly, a particle filter is used to fuse information from dead reckoning and WiFi or Bluetooth adapters to provide an accurate location of the person holding a smartphone. Unfortunately, the existing solutions largely ignore the gains that emerge when a single localization system estimates locations of multiple users in the same environment. Approaches based on filtration maintain only estimates of the current poses of the users, marginalizing the historical data. Therefore, it is difficult to fuse data from multiple individual trajectories that are usually not perfectly synchronized in time. We propose a system that fuses the information from WiFi and dead reckoning employing the graph-based optimization, which is widely applied in robotics. The presented system can be used for localization of a single user, but the improvement is especially visible when this approach is extended to a multi-user scenario. The article presents a number of experiments performed with a smartphone inside an office building. These experiments demonstrate that graph-based optimization can be used as an efficient fusion mechanism to obtain accurate trajectory estimates both in the case of a single user and in a multi-user indoor localization system. The code of our system together with recorded dataset will be made available when the paper gets published.;-;-;-;hard_0

22;24800811;Comparative functional analysis of wheat (Triticum aestivum) zinc finger-containing glycine-rich RNA-binding proteins in response to abiotic stresses.;Although the functional roles of zinc finger-containing glycine-rich RNA-binding proteins (RZs) have been characterized in several plant species, including Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa), the physiological functions of RZs in wheat (Triticum aestivum) remain largely unknown. Here, the functional roles of the three wheat RZ family members, named TaRZ1, TaRZ2, and TaRZ3, were investigated using transgenic Arabidopsis plants under various abiotic stress conditions. Expression of TaRZs was markedly regulated by salt, dehydration, or cold stress. The TaRZ1 and TaRZ3 proteins were localized to the nucleus, whereas the TaRZ2 protein was localized to the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and cytoplasm. Germination of all three TaRZ-expressing transgenic Arabidopsis seeds was retarded compared with that of wild-type seeds under salt stress conditions, whereas germination of TaRZ2- or TaRZ3-expressing transgenic Arabidopsis seeds was retarded under dehydration stress conditions. Seedling growth of TaRZ1-expressing transgenic plants was severely inhibited under cold or salt stress conditions, and seedling growth of TaRZ2-expressing plants was inhibited under salt stress conditions. By contrast, expression of TaRZ3 did not affect seedling growth of transgenic plants under any of the stress conditions. In addition, expression of TaRZ2 conferred freeze tolerance in Arabidopsis. Taken together, these results suggest that different TaRZ family members play various roles in seed germination, seedling growth, and freeze tolerance in plants under abiotic stress.  ;polyglycine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
23;6093652;In vitro and in vivo detection of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus in fish by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.;A double antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV). The ELISA detected VR299 strain of IPNV at a dose of 10 to 20 ng of purified IPNV protein or 10(4) TCID50 in tissue culture fluid. Specificity of ELISA was demonstrated by an ELISA inhibition test. The ELISA did not detect infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus. Normal cell culture fluid and virus-non-inoculated rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri Richardson) homogenate did not react in the test system. The IPNV was detected in rainbow trout fry inoculated with IPNV. Although infective virus titer in fish decreased rapidly 1 week after inoculation, IPNV antigen was detected by ELISA for 15 days. The IPNV antigen was detected in the fish tissue after inactivation of infective virus. The ELISA is a rapid and reliable method for the diagnosis of IPNV infection.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
27;32087618;The essential effector SCRE1 in Ustilaginoidea virens suppresses rice immunity via a small peptide region.;The biotrophic fungal pathogen Ustilaginoidea virens causes rice false smut, a newly emerging plant disease that has become epidemic worldwide in recent years. The U. virens genome encodes many putative effector proteins that, based on the study of other pathosystems, could play an essential role in fungal virulence. However, few studies have been reported on virulence functions of individual U. virens effectors. Here, we report our identification and characterization of the secreted cysteine-rich protein SCRE1, which is an essential virulence effector in U. virens. When SCRE1 was heterologously expressed in Magnaporthe oryzae, the protein was secreted and translocated into plant cells during infection. SCRE1 suppresses the immunity-associated hypersensitive response in the nonhost plant Nicotiana benthamiana. Induced expression of SCRE1 in rice also inhibits pattern-triggered immunity and enhances disease susceptibility to rice bacterial and fungal pathogens. The immunosuppressive activity is localized to a small peptide region that contains an important 'cysteine-proline-alanine-arginine-serine' motif. Furthermore, the scre1 knockout mutant generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system is attenuated in U. virens virulence to rice, which is greatly complemented by the full-length SCRE1 gene. Collectively, this study indicates that the effector SCRE1 is able to inhibit host immunity and is required for full virulence of U. virens.;polycysteine;-;-;LCR_without_function
31;31346030;Increased Expression of Fibronectin Leucine-Rich Transmembrane Protein 3 in the Dorsal Root Ganglion Induces Neuropathic Pain in Rats.;Neuropathic pain is a chronic condition that occurs frequently after nerve injury and induces hypersensitivity or allodynia characterized by aberrant neuronal excitability in the spinal cord dorsal horn. Fibronectin leucine-rich transmembrane protein 3 (FLRT3) is a modulator of neurite outgrowth, axon pathfinding, and cell adhesion, which is upregulated in the dorsal horn following peripheral nerve injury. However, the function of FLRT3 in adults remains unknown. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the involvement of spinal FLRT3 in neuropathic pain using rodent models. In the dorsal horns of male rats, FLRT3 protein levels increased at day 4 after peripheral nerve injury. In the DRG, FLRT3 was expressed in activating transcription factor 3-positive, injured sensory neurons. Peripheral nerve injury stimulated  ;polyleucine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
38;9683179;Proliferation, development and DNA adduct levels in the mammary gland of rats given 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine and a high fat diet.;2-Amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) is a heterocyclic amine derived from cooked meat that is a mammary gland carcinogen in rats. A carcinogenic dose-regimen of PhIP (75 mg/kg, p.o., 10 doses, once per day) was administered to 43-day old female Sprague-Dawley rats, and the rats were then placed on a defined high fat (23.5% corn oil) or low fat (5% corn oil) diet for up to 6 weeks. At various times after carcinogen and diet, and prior to carcinogenesis, we examined the percentage of proliferating cells in terminal end bud (TEB) epithelial structures of the rat mammary gland by proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining, mammary gland architecture by whole mounting, and PhIP-DNA adduct levels in mammary epithelial cells by the 32P-post-labeling assay. Immediately after dosing, the percentage of proliferating epithelial cells in TEBs was significantly higher in PhIP-treated rats than in control rats receiving vehicle only [7.5 +/- 0.9% (n = 99) versus 4.2 +/- 0.6% (n = 127), respectively]. The mammary glands of PhIP-treated rats showed a significantly lower density of alveolar buds (ABs) and a higher density of TEBs than control rats, which suggests that PhIP exposure partially inhibited the normal glandular differentiation of TEBs to ABs. After 6 weeks on the diet, proliferation in TEBs was statistically higher in rats given PhIP plus a high fat diet than in rats given vehicle plus a low fat diet. The mammary glands from rats on a high fat diet also showed a statistically higher density of TEBs when compared with rats on a low fat diet [2.08 +/- 0.34% versus 1.04 +/- 0.20%, respectively (n = 6)]. PhIP-DNA adduct levels were relatively high in mammary epithelial cells of treated rats. At 3 h after the last dose of PhIP, DNA adduct levels [relative adduct labeling (RAL) x 10(7), mean +/- SE] were 10.5 +/- 1.7 (n = 8) and 0.9 +/- 0.2 (n = 7) in epithelial cells isolated from mammary gland and in the liver, respectively. DNA adduct removal rates from the mammary gland were not different between rats on the high fat and low fat diets. Adducts were still detected after 6 weeks on either diet. Thus, events that occurred prior to neoplasia in the mammary glands of PhIP-treated rats include formation of PhIP-DNA adducts at relatively high levels, and enhanced proliferation in TEBs (putative sites of origin of mammary gland carcinomas) and partial inhibition of TEB differentiation. The high fat diet, a promoter of PhIP-induced mammary gland carcinogenesis, appeared to sustain the proliferative effect of PhIP in mammary gland TEBs at a time when PhIP-DNA adducts are still detectable. These early events may contribute to the targeting and carcinogenicity of PhIP to the mammary gland of rats.;-;antigen;-;hard_2

51;7590249;Constitutive NF-kappa B activation, enhanced granulopoiesis, and neonatal lethality in I kappa B alpha-deficient mice.;Transcription factors belonging to the NF-kappa B family are controlled by inhibitory I kappa B proteins, mainly I kappa B alpha and I kappa B beta. Apparently normal at birth, I kappa B alpha-/- mice exhibit severe runting, skin defects, and extensive granulopoiesis postnatally, typically dying by 8 days. Hematopoietic tissues from these mice display elevated levels of both nuclear NF-kappa B and mRNAs of some, but not all, genes thought to be regulated by NF-kappa B. NF-kappa B elevation results in these phenotypic abnormalities because mice lacking both I kappa B alpha and the p50 subunit of NF-kappa B show a dramatically delayed onset of abnormalities. In contrast to hematopoietic cells, I kappa B alpha-/- embryonic fibroblasts show minimal constitutive NF-kappa B, as well as normal signal-dependent NF-kappa B activation that is concomitant with I kappa B beta degradation. Our results indicate that I kappa b beta, but not I kappa B alpha, is required for the signal-dependent activation of NF-kappa B in fibroblasts. However, I kappa B alpha is required for the postinduction repression of NF-kappa B in fibroblasts. These results define distinct roles for the two forms of I kappa B and demonstrate the necessity for stringent control of NF-kappa B.;-;-;-;hard_0

Unconcentrated CSF is easily separated into as many as 18 bands by the use of PAGE.

This modification involves a continuous buffer environment, a pore-size concentration gradient and CSF in amounts of 0.1 to 0.4 ml. Sucrose addition is not necessary in this procedure. Whereas most central nervous system (CNS) disease states do not yield consistently distinctive protein patterns, some diseases, such as vascular disease, infectious meningitis and some metastatic tumors, yield significantly altered patterns.

54;6256395;The cyclic AMP-mediated induction of alkaline phosphatase in mouse L-cells.;A cell surface-localized glycoprotein that exhibits alkaline phosphatase activity was induced by treatment of mouse L-cell cultures with dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Treatment of cells with 1.5 mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP for a period of 7 days resulted in a approximately 2000-fold increase in the specific activity of the enzyme. Enzyme induction was dependent upon de novo RNA and protein biosynthesis since this induction was completely suppressed when actinomycin D (0.5 microgram/ml) or cycloheximide (5 microgram/ml) was administered with dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Further, the overall rates of incorporation of either [3H]glucosamine or [3H]leucine into macromolecules were identical in the presence or absence of dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Alkaline phosphatase was immunotitrated in 0.5% Triton X-100-solubilized cell extracts with antisera prepared against purified native enzyme and the results indicated that dibutyryl cyclic AMP stimulated that de novo synthesis of the enzyme. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of specifically immunoprecipitated protein from cells incubated with either [35S]methionine or [6-3H]glucosamine demonstrated that dibutyryl cyclic AMP induced a 76,000-dalton glycoprotein that was characterized as alkaline phosphatase by its identity with native alkaline phosphatase that had been labeled with 32P in its active site. Electrophoretic analysis of specifically immunoprecipitated translation products from an in vitro protein-synthesizing system supplemented with L-cell RNA isolated from uninduced and cAMP-induced cells indicated that dibutyryl cyclic AMP induced the production of alkaline phosphatase-specific mRNA. These results suggest that dibutyryl cyclic AMP directly or indirectly influences the regulation of transcription of the alkaline phosphatase gene in L-cells.;-;phosphatase activity;polyacrylamide;hard_3
56;9405357;A urokinase-sensitive region of the human urokinase receptor is responsible for its chemotactic activity.;The role of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and its receptor (uPAR/CD87) in cell migration and invasion is well substantiated. Recently, uPA has been shown to be essential in cell migration, since uPA-/- mice are greatly impaired in inflammatory cell recruitment. We have shown previously that the uPA-induced chemotaxis requires interaction with and modification of uPAR/CD87, which is the true chemoattracting molecule acting through an unidentified cell surface component which mediates this cell surface chemokine activity. By expressing and testing several uPAR/CD87 variants, we have located and functionally characterized a potent uPAR/CD87 epitope that mimics the effects of the uPA-uPAR interaction. The chemotactic activity lies in the region linking domains 1 and 2, the only protease-sensitive region of uPAR/CD87, efficiently cleaved by uPA at physiological concentrations. Synthetic peptides carrying this epitope promote chemotaxis and activate p56/p59(hck) tyrosine kinase.

65;833150;Topography of the external surface of the human red blood cell membrane studied with a nonpenetrating label, [125I]diazodiiodosulfanilic acid.;The topography of the external surface of the human red cell membrane has been studied using an impermeant radioactive probe, [125I]diazodiiodosulfanilic acid, which binds covalently to protein groups of the membrane following reaction with intact cells. The pattern of labeling was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis followed by sequential analysis of single gels for carbohydrates (by staining with the periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reagent), for proteins (by staining with Coomassie blue), and for radioactivity (by counting gels sliced in 2-mm segments). The radioactive probe bound to membrane polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 94,200, 58,100, and 46,500 (Peaks A, B, and C, respectively). Peak A co-migrated with a small periodic acid-Schiff-positive band and protein Band 3 (nomenclature of Steck) (Steck, T.L. (1974)J. Cell Biol. 62: 1-19). Peak B migrated with protein Band(s) 4.5 slightly ahead of the major membrane glycoprotein (PAS-1). Peak C migrated like glycoprotein PAS-2 and protein Band 5, the actin-like, water-soluble membrane protein. In contrast to lactoperoxidase iodination and a number of other probes, [125I]diazodiiodosulfanilic acid reacted minimally with the major membrane glycoprotein, glycophorin. When it was reacted with isolated ghosts, all molecular weight classes of polypeptides were labeled. Treatment of labeled cells with neuraminidase or trypsin altered the glycoprotein staining pattern, but not the radioactive peaks. On the other hand, Pronase eliminated the Mr=94,200 radioactive peak, diminished the other two radioactive peaks, and profoundly changed the glycoprotein and protein staining patterns. Treatment of the membranes of labeled cells in a low ionic strength alkaline medium did not alter radioactive peaks and demonstrated that Peak C differed from the actin-like membrane protein. A nonionic detergent, Triton X-100, solubilized all radioactive components. The studies have defined the binding of [125I]diazodiiodosulfanilic acid to external proteins of the human red cell membrane. Its pattern of reaction differs quantitatively and qualitatively from other commonly used reagents, and it provides a useful additional vectorial probe for the study of membrane topography. Its reactions provide further evidence of the organizational complexity of the red cell membrane and emphasize the fact that interpretation of information derived from the use of membrane probes must take into account the differences resulting from the properties of the probing reagents themselves.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
68;28490361;Adducin family proteins possess different nuclear export potentials.;The adducin (ADD) family proteins, namely ADD1, ADD2, and ADD3, are actin-binding proteins that play important roles in the stabilization of membrane cytoskeleton and cell-cell junctions. All the ADD proteins contain a highly conserved bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) at the carboxyl termini, but only ADD1 can localize to the nucleus. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear. To avoid the potential effect of cell-cell junctions on the distribution of ADD proteins, HA epitope-tagged ADD proteins and mutants were transiently expressed in NIH3T3 fibroblasts and their distribution in the cytoplasm and nucleus was examined by immunofluorescence staining. Several nuclear proteins were identified to interact with ADD1 by mass spectrometry, which were further verified by co-immunoprecipitation. In this study, we found that ADD1 was detectable both in the cytoplasm and nucleus, whereas ADD2 and ADD3 were detected only in the cytoplasm. However, ADD2 and ADD3 were partially (~40%) sequestered in the nucleus by leptomycin B, a CRM1/exportin1 inhibitor. Upon the removal of leptomycin B, ADD2 and ADD3 re-distributed to the cytoplasm. These results indicate that ADD2 and ADD3 possess functional NLS and are quickly transported to the cytoplasm upon entering the nucleus. Indeed, we found that ADD2 and ADD3 possess much higher potential to counteract the activity of the NLS derived from Simian virus 40 large T-antigen than ADD1. All the ADD proteins appear to contain multiple nuclear export signals mainly in their head and neck domains. However, except for the leucine-rich motif ( Our results suggest that ADD2 and ADD3 possess functional NLS and shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus. The discrepancy in the subcellular localization of the ADD isoforms arises due to their different nuclear export capabilities. In addition, the interaction of ADD1 with RNA polymerase II and zinc-finger protein 331 implicates a potential role for ADD1 in the regulation of transcription. ;polyleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
69;24626168;Regulatory T-cell vaccination independent of auto-antigen.;To date, efforts to treat autoimmune diseases have primarily focused on the disease symptoms rather than on the cause of the disease. In large part, this is attributed to not knowing the responsible auto-antigens (auto-Ags) for driving the self-reactivity coupled with the poor success of treating autoimmune diseases using oral tolerance methods. Nonetheless, if tolerogenic approaches or methods that stimulate regulatory T (Treg) cells can be devised, these could subdue autoimmune diseases. To forward such efforts, our approach with colonization factor antigen I (CFA/I) fimbriae is to establish bystander immunity to ultimately drive the development of auto-Ag-specific Treg cells. Using an attenuated Salmonella vaccine expressing CFA/I fimbriae, fimbriae-specific Treg cells were induced without compromising the vaccine's capacity to protect against travelers' diarrhea or salmonellosis. By adapting the vaccine's anti-inflammatory properties, it was found that it could also dampen experimental inflammatory diseases resembling multiple sclerosis (MS) and rheumatoid arthritis. Because of this bystander effect, disease-specific Treg cells are eventually induced to resolve disease. Interestingly, this same vaccine could elicit the required Treg cell subset for each disease. For MS-like disease, conventional CD25(+) Treg cells are stimulated, but for arthritis CD39(+) Treg cells are induced instead. This review article will examine the potential of treating autoimmune diseases without having previous knowledge of the auto-Ag using an innocuous antigen to stimulate Treg cells via the production of transforming growth factor-β and interleukin-10.;-;antigen;-;hard_2

Our group has previously reported on the rationale and development of a mechanical device for the treatment of intra-arterial thrombosis. This device removes fibrin from thrombus, allowing for dissolution of the cellular elements of the thrombus. Theoretically, thrombus removal (as opposed to displacement) might result in a lower rate of acute rethrombosis. The present study utilizes the device percutaneously in the coronary arteries of closed chest swine and compares recanalization and reocclusion rates with standard balloon angioplasty. Twenty-six animals with total thrombotic coronary occlusions were treated; 13 with each device. Reocclusion rates with the thrombectomy device were significantly reduced at 60 min and 120 min after recanalization (p < 0.02), and the mean time to reocclusion was prolonged by 45 min (p = 0.07). Technical problems included poor handling characteristics in early prototypes and stress fractures secondary to improper use. Changes in catheter design and operator protocols have largely eliminated these problems. We conclude that this study demonstrates the feasibility of percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy in the coronary arteries and that reocclusion rates after recanalization of thrombotic occlusions compare favorably to standard angioplasty.";-;-;-;hard_0
85;16453807;Novel expression of the ribosomal RNA genes in the extreme thermophile and archaebacterium Desulfurococcus mobilis.;"The single 16S/23S rRNA operon of the sulfur-dependent extreme thermophile Desulfurococcus mobilis is transcriptionally uncoupled from the single 5S RNA gene. Transcription of the former operon initiates at five sites, P5-P1. RNA polymerases intiating at sites P5-P2 terminate and then reinitiate at the next downstream site, thus providing a queue of polymerases at the primary initiation site P1. Putative promoter sequences that are AT-rich lie upstream from each site. Termination occurs at two main sites within long pyrimidine sequences downstream from the 23S RNA gene. A processing site for both large RNAs occurs at a secondary structural feature common to other archaebacterial rRNAs. Transcription of 5S RNA starts mainly at P1/5S at the 5' end of the gene with a low level of initiation from two upstream sites; a similar mechanism of initiation-termination-reinitiation appears to operate and the sites are all preceded by AT-rich promoter-like sequences. Termination occurs a few nucleotides beyound the 3' end of the 5S RNA. The mature RNA contains 133 nucleotides, has a 78% GC bp content and exhibits an unusually extended version of helix I with heterogeneous ends. The expression of the rRNA genes shows characteristics of eukaryotes, eubacteria and archaebacteria. ";polythreonine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
89;8227327;Antigen mimicry in autoimmune disease sharing of amino acid residues critical for pathogenic T cell activation.;A nonamer peptide from murine nicotinic acetylcholine receptor delta chain (ACR delta), which shared four amino acid residues with a nonamer peptide of murine ovarian zona pellucida glycoprotein ZP3, induced murine autoimmune oophoritis and IgG autoantibody to the zona pellucida. Crossreaction between the ACR delta and ZP3 peptides was established by the response of a ZP3 peptide-specific, oophoritogenic T cell clone to both peptides in association with IA (alpha k beta b). By substituting the ZP3 peptides with a single alanine, four amino acids within the ZP3 peptide were found to be important for ovarian autoimmune disease, autoantibody response, and stimulation of the ZP3-specific T cell clone. Substitution with conservative amino acids of three residues also ablated activity, whereas the fourth, a phenylalanine, was replaceable by tyrosine without loss of activity. Of the four critical amino acids, three were shared between the ZP3 peptide and the ACR delta peptide. Moreover, polyalanine peptides with the four critical ZP3 amino acids or the four amino acids common to the ZP3 and ACR delta peptides induced immune response to ZP3 and elicited severe ovarian autoimmune disease. Thus, organ-specific autoimmune disease can occur through immune response against unrelated self (or foreign) peptides that share with a self-peptide sufficient common amino acid residues critical for activation of pathogenic, autoreactive T cells.; polyalanine ;-;-;LCR_without_function
90;9776731;Calcium- and protein kinase C-dependent activation of the tyrosine kinase PYK2 by angiotensin II in vascular smooth muscle.;Angiotensin II (Ang II) induces vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) growth by activating Gq-protein-coupled AT1 receptors, which leads to elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) and activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and mitogen-activated protein kinases. To assess the link between these Ang II-induced signaling events, we examined the effect of Ang II on the proline-rich tyrosine kinase (PYK2), previously found to be activated by a variety of stimuli that increase [Ca2+]i or activate PKC. PYK2 distribution was demonstrated in rat aortic tissue and in cultured VSMC by immunohistochemistry, revealing a cytosolic distribution distinct from smooth muscle alpha-actin, focal adhesion kinase, or paxillin. The involvement of PYK2 in Ang II signaling was measured by immunoprecipitation and immune complex kinase assays. Treatment of quiescent VSMC with Ang II resulted in a concentration- and time-dependent increase in PYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity in PYK2 immunoprecipitates. PYK2 phosphorylation was inhibited by AT1 receptor blockade and was attenuated by downregulation of PKC or the chelation of [Ca2+]i. Treatment with either phorbol ester or Ca2+ ionophore also increased PYK2 phosphorylation, suggesting that PKC activation and/or increased [Ca2+]i are both necessary and sufficient to activate PYK2. Activation of PYK2 by Ang II was also associated with increased PYK2-src complex formation, suggesting that PYK2 activation represents a potential link between Ang II-stimulated [Ca2+]i and PKC activation with downstream signaling events such as mitogen-activated protein kinase activation involved in the regulation of VSMC growth.;polyproline;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function

A complete clinical and histologic remission of disease, lasting for a median duration in excess of 18 months, was achieved in nineteen patients (61%) with MF.

99;839181;Esterase isozyme patterns in developing embryos of Brachydanio rerio (zebra danio), Brachydanio abolineatus (pearl danio), and their hybrids.;"The ontogeny of esterase isozymes in Brachydanio rerio (zebra danio), Brachydanio albolineatus (pearl danio), and hybrids formed by their reciprocal crosses was investigated using polyacrylamide disc electrophoresis. Seven esterase isozymes were identified in each species from the unfertilized egg stage to nine days posthatch. Electrophoretic analysis of qualitative changes in enzyme pattern indicated that some esterases were present at all stages of development while other esterases abruptly appeared at a specific stage of morphological differentiation. The esterases of both species were classified on the basis differential substrate and inhibitor specificities. In developing hybrids formed by B. rerio eggs inseminated with B. albolineatus sperm, the maternal isozyme pattern persisted until Stage 17 (gastrulation). Embryonic extracts from Stage 17 onward showed a slow-moving, DFP-sensitive carboxylesterase of paternal origin. In developing hybrids formed by B. albolineatus eggs inseminated with B. rerio sperm, a paternal contribution to the esterase pattern was probably present by the end of gastrulation; esterase activity of distinctively paternal origin was present by Stage 22 (retinal pigmentation) The maternal contribution to the total esterase profile appeared to remain high through hatching. Additional evidence for gene activity at gastrulation was obtained in experiments utilizing actinomycin-D and cycloheximide. Results of exposing embryos of B. rerio to 15 mug/ml of actinomycin-D indicated that transcription of the template RNA coding for cholinesterase occurred during gastrulation or some 20-30 hours prior to the appearance of the isozyme at Stage 22. This template RNA was translated sometime during that 10-hour interval immediately preceding Stage 22.";-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1

AN-7 was fractionated into three different components, A, B and D. From 18 liters of culture broth (78 units/ml), 10 mg of AN-7A with a specific activity of 2,053 units/mg, 9 mg of AN-7B (1,167 units/mg) and 11 mg of AN-7D (6,225 units/mg) were obtained. All of these samples gave single bands on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. They are acidic polypeptides with molecular weights ranging from 12,400 to 13,000. Their UV absorption spectra showed maxima peaks at 280 nm and shoulders at 290 nm. Each AN-7 component has a nonprotein chromophoric component. AN-7A, -7B and -7D have no antibacterial activity against the Gram-negative bacteria tested but strongly inhibit the growth of Gram-positive bacteria and Escherichia coli MP2, a macromolecule permeable mutant strain. The AN-7 components are mutagenic. These antibiotics inhibit the in vitro growth of L1210 cells (ED50 0.13 approximately 0.18 micrograms/ml).

Its 5'-flanking region lacks typical transcriptional regulatory sequences, such as TATA and CCAAT boxes, but contains GC-rich sequences and seven putative binding sites for a transcription factor, Sp1. One major transcription start point has been determined. The overall exon-intron organization suggested that three different Rae28 mRNAs are generated through alternative splicing.

104;8235409;[Antithrombotic treatment of permanent atrial fibrillation].;Whether idiopathic or associated with an underlying heart disease, complete arrhythmia induced by atrial fibrillation ranks first among the causes of arterial embolism. It has been recognized that 30 to 35% of subjects with arrhythmia develop a transient or permanent ischaemic cerebral accident, and it is therefore rational to assess the value of systematic antithrombotic treatment in the prevention of such accidents. It is agreed by all that anticoagulants are necessary when atrial fibrillation occurs in the course of cardiac valve diseases, notably those of rheumatismal origin. Conversely, the idiopathic complete arrhythmia, which usually occurs in subjects aged below 60, calls for either therapeutic abstention or prescription of antiplatelet drugs. In all other cases, five randomized trials can be used as reference. They all show that thromboembolic accidents and mortality can be reduced and favour a systematic preventive treatment. The risk of haemorrhage has been diversely evaluated in these five trials. The choice between anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapies therefore rests on a case by case analysis aimed at balancing in each patient the benefits expected against the possible risks.;-;-;-;hard_0
111;1592092;Fasciola hepatica: molecular cloning, nucleotide sequence, and expression of a gene encoding a polypeptide homologous to a Schistosoma mansoni fatty acid-binding protein.;Immunization of mice with an antigenic polypeptide from Fasciola hepatica adult worms and having an apparent molecular mass of 12,000 Da (Fh12) has been shown to reduce the worm burden from challenge infection with Schistosoma mansoni by more than 50%. Moreover, mice infected with S. mansoni develop antibodies to Fh12 after 5-6 weeks of infection, indicating that this Fasciola-derived antigen is a cross-reactive, cross-protective protein. A lambda gt11 F. hepatica cDNA library was constructed from poly(A)+ RNA extracted from adult worms. A cDNA encoding a cross-reactive polypeptide (Fh15) was cloned by screening the F. hepatica lambda gt11 library with a monospecific, polyclonal rabbit antiserum against pure, native Fh12. The cDNA was sequenced and the predicted amino acid sequence revealed an open reading frame encoding a 132-amino-acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of 14,700 Da. This protein has significant homology to a 14-kDa S. mansoni fatty acid-binding protein.

116;3250232;Regulation of mammalian S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase.;"S-Adenosylmethionine decarboxylase is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of polyamines that is the rate limiting step in the formation of spermidine and spermine. The activity of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase is known to be regulated negatively by these polyamines and positively by their precursor, putrescine. A specific antiserum to S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase was raised by immunizing rabbits with the homogeneous enzyme purified from rat prostate and a specific radioimmunoassay for the protein was set up. Using this radioimmunoassay it was found that a number of inhibitors of other steps in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway lead to increases in the amount of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase protein. These changes were caused by both a decreased rate of degradation and an increased rate of synthesis of the protein. The increased synthesis was due to two factors; a rise in the amount of translatable mRNA and an enhanced translation efficiency. The mRNA content of the prostate was substantially increased by treatment for 3 days with alpha-difluoromethylornithine (2% in drinking water). The translation of mRNA for S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase was studied using a polyamine-depleted reticulocyte lysate supplemented with mRNA from rat prostate and the antiserum to precipitate the proteins corresponding to S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase. These studies indicated that the enzyme was synthesized as an inactive precursor of Mr 37,000 which was converted to the enzyme sub-unit of Mr 32,000. The conversion of the precursor to the active sub-unit in vitro was increased by putrescine. The precursor could also be detected by immunoblotting of extracts from prostates of rats depleted of putrescine by treatment with the ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor, alpha-difluoromethylornithine. The translation of the S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase mRNA in the reticulocyte lysates was strongly inhibited by the addition of spermidine or spermine demonstrating that polyamines directly inhibit the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase. cDNA clones corresponding to S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase were isolated using prostatic mRNA from polysomes enriched in S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase by immunopurification. The use of these probes showed that rat ventral prostate contains two S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase mRNA species of approximately 3.4 and 2.1 kb which differ in the 3' non-translated sequence. The sequence of these cDNAs will enable the amino acid sequence of the precursor to be obtained. This will provide evidence on the origin of the pyruvate prosthetic group of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)";-;-;-;hard_0
119;1321411;The AT-rich tract of the SV40 ori core: negative synergism and specific recognition by single stranded and duplex DNA binding proteins.;The SV40 origin of replication comprises a run of thymine and adenine residues. Integrity of this AT-rich sequence is known to be essential for replication. We set out to study whether or not these elements can work synergistically to sustain replication. Quite surprisingly, additional copies of the AT stretch linked to a functional SV40 ori core dramatically reduce its replication in Cosl cells, probably by creating some physical block. Interestingly, the same inhibiting effect can be observed with the addition in cis of the yeast ARS consensus, which is homologous to the SV40 AT stretch. This modulation is possibly due to the action of cellular factors that recognize either of the two sequences. In fact, we demonstrate the existence of factor(s) in Cosl crude nuclear extracts that in vitro can specifically bind to either of them. Moreover, we show that these sequence-specific factor(s) (MW about 50 kDa), named SOAP, recognize both single (T-rich strand) and double stranded forms of the AT tracts. Binding to single stranded AT stretches can be specifically inhibited by the corresponding duplex form, but not vice versa. ;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
120;593182;The immunoregulatory role of cholesterol and other lipids: a hypothesis.;Membrane lipids play an important role in cellular responses to exogenous signals. In immunocompetent lymphocytes, marked changes in the concentrations of membrane lipids occur following cell-antigen interaction. These changes lead to an increase in membrane fluidity, thus facilitating the microaggregation of receptor-antigen complexes. This event constitutes the inductive signal for lymphocytes. Lipid profile alterations leading to increased concentration of membrane cholesterol, of polyunsaturated lipids, or of both, bring about a decrease in membrane fluidity. The latter interferes with receptor displacement preventing delivery of an inductive signal to the responding cell. Interference with microaggregation is readily brought about in interactions involving low affinity antigens, such as tumoral antigens. We postulate that in hyperlipidemic and hypercholesterolemic states there is decreased immune responsiveness to weak antigens due to the aformentioned lipid profile alterations in the membranes of immunocompetent cells. The manner in which an increase in the concentration of the lipids mentioned can lead to decreased immune responsiveness and hence to an increased incidence of malignancies in hyperlipidemic and hypercholesterolemic states is the hypothesis presented in this paper.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
121;3429209;Localization of a structural defect in type I procollagen in a patient affected with the severe non-lethal form of Osteogenesis imperfecta.;A case of severe non-lethal Osteogenesis imperfecta was studied. The patient's cultured skin fibroblasts synthesised a mixed population of type I collagen chains some of which showed abnormal behaviour on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Further analysis revealed that two types of alpha 1(I) chains were synthesised, both an abnormal, slower migrating and a normal species. A small defect in one allele of one of the type I procollagen chains could lead to the larger size of the abnormal chains, probably caused by overmodifications of the triple helical region. CNBr peptide mapping allowed us to localise the defect midway along the triple helix: the defect site could be assigned to the region between the alpha 1(I)CB-3 and CB-7 peptides. The abnormal alpha 1(I) chains synthesised by the patient's cells had a melting temperature which was about 2 degrees C lower than normal chains. The results appear to be in agreement with the defect localisation and the phenotype.;-;helix;polyacrylamide;hard_3

In this paper, the NAFTA is presented as an opportunity to improve environmental and occupational health in Mexico and assumes that the study of the potential impact of NAFTA could help to find the solutions of the former and actual environmental health problems. From this perspective, the north-border maquila industry is analyzed as a case study for the purpose of identifying and predicting the impact of NAFTA on environmental and the occupational health. Preventive as well as control measurements are suggested. The general characteristics of the U.S.-Mexico border and the maquila industry are presented. The lack of both social investment and urban planning along with population and economical growth are described. An explanation of the impact that these factors have had on the environmental and occupational problems is discussed. Special emphasis is given to the human health problems including that of water, air and soil contamination by industrial toxic residues. Also, some possible health impact of NAFTA are outlined. Finally a sustainable developmental intervention is suggested, based on NAFTA as an opportunity to take advantage of coming structural changes that will improve the environmental health conditions at the northern-border and in the entire country.;-;-;-;hard_0

The SfiI-digested T. parva genomic DNA resolved into approximately 30 fragments while the NotI digestion produced between 4-7 bands. The summation of the sizes of SfiI fragments gave an estimate of 9-10 X 10(6) base pairs for the size of the T. parva genome. Heterogeneity within T. p. parva Muguga, Pemba/Mnarani and Mariakani stocks was detected. All the T. parva stocks analysed showed SfiI and NotI restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP). Hybridisation of 5 SfiI-digested T. parva DNAs with a Plasmodium berghei telomeric repeat probe suggested that most of the polymorphisms and heterogeneity occurred in the telomeric or sub-telomeric regions of the genome. The recognition by the Plasmodium telomeric probe of 7-8 strongly hybridising SfiI bands indicates that the T. parva genome may possess at least 4 chromosomes. The T. mutans genome was cut frequently with the above enzymes resulting in large numbers of fragments predominantly below 50 kb, thus suggesting either a much higher G + C content than T. parva or the presence of highly reiterated G + C-rich regions.;polycysteine;-;-;LCR_without_function

136;1645755;Molecular basis of apolipoprotein (a) isoform size heterogeneity as revealed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.;"Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a cholesterol-rich lipoprotein that is distinguished by its content of a glycoprotein called apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)]. Apo(a) varies in size among individuals owing to different numbers of cysteine-rich sequences that are homologous to kringle 4 of plasminogen. The genetic basis for this variation is not understood at the genomic level. In this study we used pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and genomic blotting to identify a highly polymorphic restriction fragment from the apo(a) gene. The fragment contains multiple tandem repeats of a kringle 4-encoding sequence and varies in length from 48 to 190 kb depending on the number of kringle 4-encoding sequences. A total of 19 different alleles were identified among 102 unrelated Caucasian Americans. 94% of individuals studied had two different alleles which could be distinguished by size on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The degree of size heterogeneity was much greater than had been previously appreciated based on the analysis of the apparent molecular mass of the protein. The size of the apo(a) gene correlated directly with the size of the apo(a) protein, and inversely with the concentration of Lp(a) in plasma. Segregation analysis of the apo(a) gene was performed in families; siblings with identical apo(a) genotypes had similar plasma levels of Lp(a). These results suggest that in the normal population, the level of plasma Lp(a) is largely determined by alleles at the apo(a) locus.";polycysteine;-;-;LCR_without_function
138;1560169;Antigenic and allergenic analysis of psyllium seed components.;The outer portions (husk) of psyllium seeds are a concentrated source of natural fiber used in some bulk-fiber laxatives and cereals. They are known to elicit respiratory allergic reactions after inhalation or ingestion among sensitized individuals. Antigenic and allergenic characterization of three psyllium-seed fractions (husk, endosperm, and embryo) was conducted with crossed immunoelectrophoresis (CIE), crossed radioimmunoelectrophoresis, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to determine the source of psyllium allergenicity. Homologous CIE demonstrated psyllium endosperm and embryo extracts contained seven and four antigens, respectively. Husk extracts were too gelatinous to react by CIE. However, heterologous CIE profiles of endosperm or embryo extracts, reacted with antihusk antibodies, resulted in antigen-antibody precipitin peaks that matched the heavy staining precipitin lines of homologous reactions for endosperm and embryo, respectively. These results indicated that commercial-grade husk, endosperm, and embryo contained similar antigens. Extracts of all three seed components contained antigens that bound IgE antibodies in the sera of 11 psyllium RAST-positive individuals, as determined by crossed radioimmunoelectrophoresis. The few prominent husk protein/peptide bands resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were common in either embryo or endosperm. Immunoblots revealed common IgE reactive bands in all three seed fractions. Microscopic examination of the powdered commercial-grade psyllium (95% pure) revealed it contained endosperm and embryo particles. These immunologic, biochemical, and microscopic findings suggest that other contaminating seed components are primarily responsible for the allergenicity of commercial-grade psyllium-husk powder rather than the husk itself.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3

These proteins are resolved in two-dimensional electrophoresis (AUT-PAGE x SDS-PAGE). Three proteins with an apparent molecular mass of 16, 16.5 and 17 kDa (p16, p16.5 and p17) are present in addition to the major 14 kDa basic nuclear component (HCc). HCc itself is resolved in three proteins (alpha, beta and gamma). When the proteins are not reduced with 2-mercaptoethanol before 2D-PAGE, the migration of HCc alpha, beta and gamma is modified in a way which suggests the formation of both inter- and intramolecular disulfide bridges and thus, the presence of at least two cysteines. The amino-acid analysis of HCc proteins resolved in 2D gels confirms that they are lysine-rich. HCc alpha, beta and gamma as well as p16, p16.5 and p17 are removed from isolated chromatin with 0.6 M NaCl, indicating that their affinity for DNA in vivo is lower than that of core histones. Furthermore, in vitro, they bind more tightly to single-stranded than to double-stranded DNA.;polylysine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Since the chief structural determinant of Cad specificity is N-acetylgalactosamine, the membrane receptors have been isolated by affinity binding on immobilized Dolichos biflorus (horse gram) lectin. The predominant species eluted from the gel was the abnormal glycoprotein alpha, whereas in control experiments no material could be recovered from the adsorbent incubated with group-B Cad-negative erythrocyte membranes. After partition of the membranes with organic solvents, the blood-group-Cad activity was found in aqueous phases containing the sialoglycoproteins, but not in the organic phases containing simple or complex glycolipids, which, however, retained the blood-group-B activity. The carbohydrate composition of highly purified lipid-free glycoprotein alpha molecules prepared from Cad and control erythrocytes was determined. Interestingly the molar ratio of N-acetylneuraminic acid to N-acetylgalactosamine was equal to 2:1 in the case of controls and equal to 1:1 in the case of Cad erythrocytes. Taken together these results suggest that Cad specificity is defined by N-acetylgalactosamine residues carried by the alkali-labile oligosaccharide chains attached to the erythrocyte membrane sialo-glycoproteins.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1

The incorporated radioactivity migrated as a sharply defined peak in association with a protein band which moved more slowly than H1, the major protein component. The following observations indicate that this complex is composed of two molecules of H1 and a single chain of poly(ADP-ribose) with one detectable covalent linkage of polymer to protein. 1. The [14C]arginine/[3H]lysine ratio is identical in H1 histone and in the protein moiety of the complex. 2. Protein is displaced from H1 histone to the complex during poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis. At least 90% of the protein in the complex (stainable protein and labelled protein) is derived from H1. 3. Sedimentation rate studies indicate a molecular weight of the complex about twice that of H1 histone. 4. The average chain length of the polymer is 15 ADP-ribose units and there are 7--8 ADP-ribose units for each molecule of H1 histone in the 'complex'. 5. Poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase, which hydrolyses the polymer exoglycosidically from the AMP terminus, degrades the complex producing ADP-ribose and mono-ADP-ribosylated H1 histone which co-electrophoreses with unmodified H1. Although only one covalent linkage between protein and polymer has been detected, the 'complex' does not dissociate when electrophoresed on dodecylsulfate gels. Nor can the noncovalently linked H1 histone of the complex readily exchange with free H1. Complex formation does not occur when purified poly(ADP-ribose) and H1 are mixed.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
163;21554500;Mitotic kinase Aurora-B is regulated by SUMO-2/3 conjugation/deconjugation during mitosis.;The small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) system of higher eukaryotes plays important roles in normal cell division, especially in chromosome segregation. However, only a few mitotic SUMO substrates have been identified in mammals. Here, we show that the mitotic kinase Aurora-B can be modified by SUMO. The E3 SUMO-protein ligase PIAS3 [protein inhibitor of activated STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription)] dramatically enhanced poly-SUMO-2/3 conjugation of Aurora-B, whereas the SUMO-specific isopeptidase SENP2 (Sentrin/SUMO-specific protease) specifically deconjugated SUMO from Aurora-B. The Lys-202 residue on human Aurora-B was preferentially modified by SUMO, and enhancement of SUMOylation in cells facilitated Aurora-B autophosphorylation, which is essential for its activation. Conversely, SENP2-mediated deSUMOylation of Aurora-B down-regulated its autophosphorylation in cells and also impaired its re-activation in Aurora inhibitor VX-680-treated mitotic cells. Poly-SUMO-2 conjugation of Aurora-B occurred during the M phase of the cell cycle, and both SUMO-2 and PIAS3 were localized adjacent to Aurora-B in the kinetochores in early mitosis. Based on these results, we propose that Aurora-B is a novel mitotic SUMO substrate and that its kinase activity is fine-tuned by the SUMO system. ;polyserine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
167;30095909;Differential Antibody Responses to Outer Membrane Proteins Contribute to Differential Immune Protections between Live and Inactivated Vibrio parahemolyticus.;"It is widely accepted that live vaccines elicit higher immune protection than inactivated vaccines. However, the mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, an array with 64 recombinant outer membrane proteins of Vibrio parahemolyticus was developed to explore antibody responses of live and inactivated V. parahemolyticus post immunization of the 8th, 12th, 16th and 20th day. Among the 64 outer membrane proteins, 28 elicited antibody generation. They were all detected in live vaccine-induced immunity but only 15 antibodies were found in inactivated vaccine-induced immunity. Passive immunization showed that higher percent survival was detected in live than inactivated vaccine-induced immunities. Active immunization indicated that out of 19 randomly selected outer membrane proteins, 5 stimulated immune protection against V. parahemolyticus infection. Among them, antibodies to VP2309 and VPA0526 were shared in mice immunized by live or inactivated vaccines, whereas antibodies to VPA0548, VPA1745, and VP1667 were only found in mice immunized by live vaccine. In addition, live V. parahemolyticus stimulated earlier antibody response than inactivated bacteria. These results indicate that not all of the outer membrane proteins elicited antibody responses when they work together in the form of live or inactivated bacteria; live vaccine elicits more protective antibodies, which contribute to higher immune protection in live vaccine than inactivated vaccine. Notably, the recombinant proteins might be different from those separated from live bacteria, and they might be different in their immunogenic potencies.";-;-;-;hard_0
169;8021609;Nucleotide sequence and expression of the spike (S) gene of canine coronavirus and comparison with the S proteins of feline and porcine coronaviruses.;"We have cloned, sequenced and expressed the spike (S) gene of canine coronavirus (CCV; strain K378). Its deduced amino acid sequence has revealed features in common with other coronavirus S proteins: a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids at the amino terminus (the putative signal sequence), another hydrophobic region at the carboxy terminus (the membrane anchor), heptad repeats preceding the anchor, and a cysteine-rich region located just downstream from it. Like other representatives of the same antigenic cluster (CCV-Insavc-1 strain, feline infectious peritonitis and enteric coronaviruses, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis and respiratory coronaviruses, and the human coronavirus HCV 229E), the CCV S polypeptide lacks a proteolytic cleavage site present in many other coronavirus S proteins. Pairwise comparisons of the S amino acid sequences within the antigenic cluster demonstrated that the two CCV strains (K378 and Insavc-1) are 93.3% identical, about as similar to each other as they are to the two feline coronaviruses. The porcine sequences are clearly more divergent mainly due to the large differences in the amino-terminal (residues 1 to 300) domains of the proteins; when only the carboxy-terminal parts (residues 301 and on) are considered the homologies between the canine, feline and porcine S polypeptides are generally quite high, with identities ranging from 90.8% to 96.8% . The human coronavirus is less related to the other members of the antigenic group. A phylogenetic tree constructed on the basis of the S sequences showed that the two CCVs are evolutionarily more related to the feline than to the porcine viruses. Expression of the CCV S gene using the vaccinia virus T7 RNA polymerase system yielded a protein of the expected M(r) (approximately 200K) which could be immunoprecipitated with an anti-feline infectious peritonitis virus polyclonal serum and which was indistinguishable from the S protein synthesized in CCV-infected cells.";polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

Recently the bZIP transcription factors HY5 (LONG HYPOCOTYL5) and HYH (HOMOLOG OF HY5) were identified as positive regulators in light activation of NIA2 (nitrate reductase 2). The bHLH transcription factor PIF4 (PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4) was revealed as an inhibitor of NIA2 expression. In contrast to NIA2, expression of other genes of nitrogen assimilation, NRT1.1 (dual-affinity nitrate transporter 1.1), NIA1 (nitrate reductase 1), NIR (nitrite reductase), GLN2 (glutamine synthetase 2) and GLU1 (glutamate synthase 1) were not promoted by HY5/HYH or inhibited by PIF4.

175;7960148;Conservation of immune responses to proteins isolated by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis from the outer membrane of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae.;Outer membrane proteins P2, P4, and P6 and two with molecular masses of 26 and 28 kDa have been purified from a strain of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae by a preparative form of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Outer membrane protein P6, with a molecular mass of 16 kDa (determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS]-PAGE) was purified by both native PAGE and SDS-PAGE from three strains of nontypeable H. influenzae and one strain of type b H. influenzae. The same conditions were required for purification from each strain. The suitability of proteins isolated by these methods was assessed by studying the immune response of rats immunized with P6 in incomplete Freund's adjuvant into the Peyer's patches. P6 purified by either native PAGE or SDS-PAGE did not differ significantly from P6 purified by gel filtration and anion-exchange chromatography in the ability to enhance pulmonary clearance of live bacteria. This study also investigated the effects of SDS on P2 immunological responses in vivo and the effects of the reagents Zwittergent and sodium lauryl sarcosinate on outer membrane protein lymphocyte-proliferative responses in vitro. It was found that the presence of SDS in the immunization emulsion enhanced the antigen-specific cell-mediated response but suppressed the antigen-specific antibody responses. The presence of residual traces of Zwittergent in an outer membrane protein preparation inhibited antigen-specific cell-mediated proliferation, whereas extraction of outer membrane proteins with sodium lauryl sarcosinate did not inhibit antigen-specific proliferation. These results demonstrate that preparative PAGE is a suitable method for the purification of proteins from the outer membrane of H. influenzae required for investigation of their immunological significance as vaccine candidates and that traces of reagents used during protein purification may play an important role in determining the success of in vivo and in vitro studies.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3

Agarose gel electrophoresis analysis 32P-labeled HTLVMT-2 virion RNA revealed that HTLVMT-2 virion RNA consists mainly of 24S and small amounts of 35S and 32S RNAs. The 24S HTLVMT-2 virion RNA and unfractionated HTLVMT-2 virion RNA were translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system in vitro. The predominant polypeptide synthesized from 24S RNA had an apparent mol. wt. of 28 000 (28 K); unfractionated HTLVMT-2 virion RNA directed the synthesis of 53 000 (53 K), 33 000 (33 K) and 28 000 (28 K) polypeptides as main components. Most of the polypeptides synthesised in vitro by translation of HTLVMT-2 virion RNAs possess the same sizes as the proteins formerly designated as ATLA (ATL-associated antigen) in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunologically precipitated with sera of ATL patients.

By means of an elective staining method and a whole mount technique, morphological and quantitative studies of the goblet cells were performed. The findings were compared with corresponding investigations of goblet cells in normal larynges. The significantly lower density in the subglottis than in the sinus of Morgagni and ventricular fold observed in normal larynges was not found in the two groups of cancer patients. Instead, there was a tendency to an equalization of the goblet cell density in all 3 laryngeal regions. In the irradiated group the goblet cell density was lower, in all 3 regions, than in the nonirradiated cancer group and in normal larynges. In the close vicinity of the cancer the goblet cell density was reduced, possibly because the cancer process had initiated metaplasia to an epithelium which was poor in goblet cells. Between the two cancer groups and normal larynges there were no morphological differences in the goblet cells.;-;-;-;hard_0
183;1640450;Kinking of RNA helices by bulged bases, and the structure of the human immunodeficiency virus transactivator response element.;We have used gel electrophoresis to show that the pyrimidine bulge of the HIV-1 TAR sequence causes a local bending of the helical axis. The TAR bulge caused a retardation in electrophoretic mobility in polyacrylamide gels. When this was placed adjacent to an additional bulged sequence in a linear RNA fragment, the mobility of the molecule varied sinusoidally with the spacing between the two bulges. Electrophoretic mobilities suggested that the TAR sequence context of the pyrimidine bulge causes a greater degree of axial kinking than in an equivalent randomly chosen sequence. Experiments in which an A5 bulge was progressively opposed by adenine bases inserted in the opposite strand showed that even a single opposed adenine markedly reduced electrophoretic mobility, i.e. axial bending, and two adenine bases reduced the mobility virtually to that of a normal duplex. We suggest that the pronounced kinking resulting from an unopposed bulge provides a particularly recognizable feature in RNA, and that this is the basis of the interaction between the HIV Tat protein and the TAR sequence.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
186;24634508;CPEB1 promotes differentiation and suppresses EMT in mammary epithelial cells.;Downregulation of CPEB1, a sequence-specific RNA-binding protein, in a mouse mammary epithelial cell line (CID-9) causes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), based on several criteria. First, CPEB1 knockdown decreases protein levels of E-cadherin and β-catenin but increases those of vimentin and Twist1. Second, the motility of CPEB1-depleted cells is increased. Third, CID-9 cells normally form growth-arrested, polarized and three-dimensional acini upon culture in extracellular matrix, but CPEB1-deficient CID-9 cells form nonpolarized proliferating colonies lacking a central cavity. CPEB1 downregulates Twist1 expression by binding to its mRNA, shortening its poly(A) tract and repressing its translation. CID-9 cultures contain both myoepithelial and luminal epithelial cells. CPEB1 increases during CID-9 cell differentiation, is predominantly expressed in myoepithelial cells, and its knockdown prevents expression of the myoepithelial marker p63. CPEB1 is present in proliferating subpopulations of pure luminal epithelial cells (SCp2) and myoepithelial cells (SCg6), but its depletion increases Twist1 only in SCg6 cells and fails to downregulate E-cadherin in SCp2 cells. We propose that myoepithelial cells prevent EMT by influencing the polarity and proliferation of luminal epithelial cells in a mechanism that requires translational silencing of myoepithelial Twist1 by CPEB1.  ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

The enzymatic activity of the spontaneously active preparation was completely destroyed by beta-mercaptoethanol. In contrast, the apparently latent enzyme was converted to a more active form of lower molecular weight (Mr 86,000) following treatment with beta-mercaptoethanol and this form of the enzyme was still stimulateable by histone-H1. These findings show that the aortic spontaneous and apparently latent phosphatase actives are ascribable to separate enzymes and they suggest that the activity of latent phosphatase in living cells may be modulated by cationic proteins such as histones or similar effector molecules.";polylysine;phosphatase activity;-;LCR_with_function

Based on the known effect of particle size and surface hydrophilicity on the capacity of nanocarriers to reach the lymph nodes, here we report the formation and characterization of 100nm polyglutamic acid-polyethylene glycol (PGA-PEG) nanocapsules together with the assessment of their potential for the treatment of cancer with lymphatic metastatic spread. To this purpose, we first studied the biodistribution of fluorescently labeled PGA-PEG nanocapsules (100nm), following, either intravenous or subcutaneous administration. The results confirmed the accumulation of nanocapsules in the lymphatic system, especially upon subcutaneous administration. Next, we evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of the docetaxel-loaded nanocapsules in an orthotopic lung cancer model that metastasizes to the lymph nodes. As expected from the rational design, DCX-loaded PGA-PEG nanocapsules exhibited a greatly enhanced antitumoral efficacy and a reduced toxicity when compared with the commercial formulation Taxotere®. Furthermore, the administration of DCX-loaded PGA-PEG nanocapsules resulted in the practical elimination of the metastatic load in the mediastinal lymph nodes, whereas the treatment with the commercial formulation had a minor effect. Overall, these findings underscore the potential of PGA-PEG nanocapsules for the delivery of anticancer drugs to both, the tumor tissue and the metastatic lymph nodes.

Methods: First, a THz metamaterial sensing method was constructed, and verified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and zeta potential; after optimizing the detection conditions of the sensor, different concentrations of miRNA-21 and other different miRNAs were detected. And this biosensor was compared with other miRNA detection methods; finally, the recovery rate of the biosensor was evaluated. Results: Under the optimal experimental conditions, through the dual signal amplification strategy of duplex-specific nuclease (DSN) cycle recognition and rolling circle amplification (RCA), the THz metamaterial sensor has a response range of 10 fmol/L to 10 nmol/L to the target miRNA-21, with a detection limit of 8.49 fmol/L. And the biosensor has good specificity with the ability to recognize the target miRNA-21 from a variety of microRNAs. And the experiment with recovery rate from 94.33% to 115.33% has been further verified in commercial human serum samples.

205;9241775;Different grades of medial hypertrophy and intimal changes in small pulmonary arteries among various types of congenital heart disease with pulmonary hypertension.;Morphometric analysis of small pulmonary arterial changes was performed in three patients with different congenital heart disease with pulmonary hypertension: congenital mitral stenosis (MS), ventricular septal defect (VSD) and transposition of the great arteries (TGA). The material was biopsy or autopsy lung specimens, all having the same degree of elevated pulmonary arterial pressure. Medial thickness was determined by the method of Suwa and Takahashi, and the degree of intimal changes was quantified using the index of pulmonary vascular disease (IPVD) by Yamaki and Tezuka. It was demonstrated that the medial thickening of the small pulmonary arteries was the strongest in the patient with congenital MS, moderate in VSD, and the weakest in TGA, with statistically significant differences between each pair of these three conditions. Interestingly, the order of severity for intimal changes was reversed: it was the severest in TGA and the mildest in congenital MS. We surmise that in patients with TGA, medial hypertrophy is suppressed by sustained vasodilation resulting from the high oxygen saturation of pulmonary arterial blood, while in congenital MS, the media undergoes the severest hypertrophy because of the low oxygen saturation. We also conclude that in TGA intimal changes readily develop in the presence of attenuated media, while in congenital MS, the thickened media seems to prevent intimal changes. From a clinical viewpoint, these results urge us to recommend early surgical intervention in TGA and VSD where severe intimal changes can develop in the absence of extreme medial thickening. It may not be appropriate to extend operation on patients with congenital MS, since strongly thickened media can trigger vasospasms and medial necrosis.;-;-;-;hard_0

In this study, attempts have been made to clone and express a recombinant chimeric protein encompassing the epitopes corresponding to bonnet monkey (Macaca radiata) ZP glycoprotein-1 (bmZP1, amino acid residues 132-147), ZP glycoprotein-2 (bmZP2, amino acid residues 86-113), and ZP glycoprotein-3 (bmZP3, amino acid residues 324-347). The above chimeric recombinant protein (r-bmZP123) was expressed as a polyhistidine fusion protein in Escherichia coli. Immunoblot with murine monoclonal antibody, MA-813, generated against recombinant bmZP1 revealed a major band of approximately 10 kDa. The r-bmZP123 was purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin under denaturing conditions. The female rabbits immunized with purified r-bmZP123 conjugated to diphtheria toxoid (DT) generated antibodies that reacted with r-bmZP123 and DT in an ELISA. In addition, the immune sera also reacted with E. coli expressed recombinant bmZP1, bmZP2, and bmZP3. In an indirect immunofluorescence assay, the antibodies against r-bmZP123 recognized native ZP of bonnet monkey as well as human. The immune sera also inhibited, in vitro, the binding of human spermatozoa to the human zona in the hemizona assay (HZA). These studies, for the first time, demonstrate the feasibility of assembling multiple epitopes of different ZP glycoproteins as a recombinant protein that elicit antibodies which are reactive with native zona and also inhibit, in vitro, human sperm-oocyte binding. ;polyhistidine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

Recent discovery of the phase-variable capsular O acetylation mechanism indicated that the O-acetyltransferase gene, neuO, is carried on a putative K1-specific prophage designated CUS-3 (E. L. Deszo, S. M. Steenbergen, D. I. Freedberg, and E. R. Vimr, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 102:5564-5569, 2005). Here we describe the isolation and characterization of a CUS-3 derivative (CUS-3a), demonstrating its morphology, lysogenization of a sensitive host, and the distribution of CUS-3 among a collection of 111 different K1 strains. The 40,207-bp CUS-3 genome was annotated from the strain RS218 genomic DNA sequence, indicating that most of the 63 phage open reading frames have their closest homologues in one of seven different lambdoid phages. Translational fusion of a reporter lacZ fragment to the hypervariable poly-Psi domain facilitated measurement of phase variation frequencies, indicating no significant differences between switch rates or effects on rates of the methyl-directed mismatch repair system. PCR analysis of poly-Psi domain length indicated preferential loss or gain of single 5'-AAGACTC-3' nucleotide repeats. Analysis of a K1 strain previously reported as ""locked on"" indicated a poly-Psi region with the least number of heptad repeats compatible with in-frame neuO expression. The combined results establish CUS-3 as an active mobile contingency locus in E. coli K1, indicating its capacity to mediate population-wide capsule variation.

211;24083089;Production of a recombinant antibody specific for i blood group antigen, a mesenchymal stem cell marker.;Multipotent mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) offer great promise for future regenerative and anti-inflammatory therapies. Panels of functional and phenotypical markers are currently used in characterization of different therapeutic stem cell populations from various sources. The i antigen (linear poly-N-acetyllactosamine) from the Ii blood group system has been suggested as a marker for MSCs derived from umbilical cord blood (UCB). However, there are currently no commercially available antibodies recognizing the i antigen. In the present study, we describe the use of antibody phage display technology to produce recombinant antibodies recognizing a structure from the surface of mesenchymal stem cells. We constructed IgM phage display libraries from the lymphocytes of a donor with an elevated serum anti-i titer. Antibody phage display technology is not dependent on immunization and thus allows the generation of antibodies against poorly immunogenic molecules, such as carbohydrates. Agglutination assays utilizing i antigen-positive red blood cells (RBCs) from UCB revealed six promising single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies, three of which recognized epitopes from the surface of UCB-MSCs in flow cytometric assays. The amino acid sequence of the VH gene segment of B12.2 scFv was highly similar to the VH4.21 gene segment required to encode anti-i specificities. Further characterization of binding properties revealed that the binding of B12.2 hyperphage was inhibited by soluble linear lactosamine oligosaccharide. Based on these findings, we suggest that the B12.2 scFv we have generated is a prominent anti-i antibody that recognizes i antigen on the surface of both UCB-MSCs and RBCs. This binder can thus be utilized in UCB-MSC detection and isolation as well as in blood group serology.  ;polyasparagine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
212;8103422;Cholinesterases regulate neurite growth of chick nerve cells in vitro by means of a non-enzymatic mechanism.;"Cholinesterases present homologies with some cell adhesion molecules; however, it is unclear whether and how they perform adhesive functions. Here, we provide the first direct evidence showing that neurite growth in vitro from various neuronal tissues of the chick embryo can be modified by some, but not all, anticholinesterase agents. By quantifying the neuritic G4 antigen in tectal cell cultures, the effect of anticholinesterases on neurite growth is directly compared with their cholinesterase inhibitory action. BW 284C51 and ethopropazine, inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), respectively, strongly decrease neurite growth in a dose-dependent manner. However, echothiophate which inhibits both cholinesterases, does not change neuritic growth. These quantitative data are supplemented by morphological observations in retinal explant cultures grown on striped laminin carpets, viz., defasciculation of neurite bundles by BW 284C51 and Bambuterol occurs, indicating that these drugs disturb adhesive mechanisms. These data strongly suggest that a) cholinesterases can participate in regulating axonal growth, b) both AChE and BChE can perform such a nonsynaptic function, and c) this function is not the result of the enzyme activity per se, since at least one drug was found that inhibits all cholinesterase activities but not neurite growth. Thus, a secondary site on cholinesterase molecules must be responsible for adhesive functions.";-;antigen;-;hard_2
213;6296253;Deletion mapping of DNA regions required for SV40 early region promoter function in vivo.;"The SV40 early region promoter, previously localized to the DNA segment bounded by the HpaII and HindIII restriction sites (nucleotides 346 and 5171), was further defined by construction of an extensive set of deletions within this region and measurement of their effects on (a) viral DNA replication, (b) virus multiplication and the ability to complement early and late mutations, (c) transformation of rat cells, (d) large T antigen formation, and (e) the location of the 5' ends of early mRNAs. One set of mutations is represented by deletions that begin at the HpaII site and extend unidirectionally for varying lengths toward the BglI site at ori. A second set of mutants contains deletions that start at ori and extend unidirectionally for varying lengths towards the HpaII site. A third set of mutants, with deletions or duplications of various lengths and boundaries, lie between the HpaII and BglI sites. Our studies indicate the following. (a) Ori, the sequence needed for initiating SV40 DNA replication, extends from the sequences needed for initiating SV40 DNA replication, extends from the sequences needed to bind T antigen to the palindrome in site II to nucleotide 34, the late region edge of the AT block. Flanking sequences adjacent to the AT block facilitate DNA replication. (b) The SV40 early region promoter comprises two functionally distinct nucleotide sequence elements. One is flanked by nucleotides 5231 and 107, and contains the RNA initiation sites at nucleotides 5231-5237, a positioning element resembling the TATAAATA consensus sequence about 20-25 nucleotides upstream, and an RNA polymerase II recognition sequence contributed by short GC-rich sequences clustered between nucleotides 35 and 107; we refer to this as the RNA polymerase II interaction site. The second distinct sequence element is contained within each of two 72-bp segments located between nucleotides 107 and 250; the behavior of this element suggests that it may influence the accessibility of RNA polymerase II for the interaction site or the efficiency of RNA chain initiation. Large T antigen binding sites I, II, and III overlap with the putative RNA polymerase II interaction site; since large T antigen does not prevent elongation of RNA transcripts initiated upstream, T antigen probably represses early region expression by preventing RNA polymerase II binding to the promoter.";polycysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
215;22262501;Noninvasive real-time fluorescence imaging of the lymphatic uptake of BSA-IRDye 680 conjugate administered subcutaneously in mice.;The goal of our studies was to determine lymphatic uptake of bovine serum albumin (BSA) using real-time noninvasive fluorescence imaging. BSA labeled with near-infrared dye (IRDye) 680 was used as a model protein-dye conjugate. The conjugation of BSA with IRDye 680 was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography and SDS-PAGE demonstrated that the IRDye 680-labeled BSA conjugate in the lymph node (LN) homogenate samples was stable at physiological temperature (37°C) for at least 5 days. Whole-body noninvasive optical imaging of hairless SKH-1 mice was performed after subcutaneous (s.c.) injection (dose = 0.1 mg/kg) into the front footpad. Noninvasive fluorescence imaging demonstrated that BSA-IRDye 680 conjugates were dynamically taken up by the lymphatic system, accumulated in the axillary LNs and then cleared, indicating that lymphatic transport plays a role in the absorption of BSA. Ex vivo tissue imaging of LN homogenates provided confirmatory data with respect to the uptake of fluorescent-labeled BSA determined by in vivo imaging. Noninvasive real-time imaging of LNs provides a novel tool for evaluating uptake and accumulation of fluorescent-labeled proteins by the lymphatic system after s.c. injection in a mouse model.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
217;24415781;Posttranscriptional modulation of cytokine production in T cells for the regulation of excessive inflammation by TFL.;Posttranscriptional machinery regulates inflammation and is associated with autoimmunity as well as tumorigenesis in collaboration with transcription factors. We previously identified the tumor suppressor gene transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL) on 6q25 in a patient with follicular lymphoma, which transformed into diffuse large B cell lymphoma. TFL families have a common RNase domain that governs macrophage-mediated inflammation. In human peripheral blood, TFL is dominantly expressed at the glycine- and tryptophan-rich cytoplasmic processing bodies of T lymphocytes, and it is persistently upregulated in activated T cells. To address its physiological role, we established TFL(-/-) mice in which TFL(-/-) lymphocytes proliferated more rapidly than TFL(+/+) upon stimulation with inappropriate cytokine secretion, including IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10. Moreover, TFL inhibited the synthesis of cytokines such as IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and IL-17a by 3' untranslated region RNA degradation. Experimental autoimmune encephalitis induced in TFL(-/-) mice demonstrated persistent severe paralysis. CNS-infiltrated CD4(+) T cells in TFL(-/-) mice contained a higher proportion of Th17 cells than did those in TFL(+/+) mice during the resolution phase, and IL-17a mRNA levels were markedly increased in TFL(-/-) cells. These results suggest that TFL may play an important role in attenuating local inflammation by suppressing the infiltration of Th17 cells in the CNS during the resolution phase of experimental autoimmune encephalitis. TFL is a novel gradual and persistent posttranscriptional regulator, and the TFL-driven attenuation of excessive inflammation could contribute to recovery from T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases.  ;polytryptophan;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
219;10873610;Cloning and characterization of the 5'-flanking region for the mouse phospholipase C-delta1 gene.;To date, little is known about the molecular mechanisms controlling the regulation of phospholipase C-delta1 (PLC-delta1) gene expression. To understand the mechanisms responsible for the regulation of PLC-delta1 gene expression, the 5'-flanking region of the mouse PLC-delta1 gene was isolated from a mouse genomic DNA library. Primer extension analysis revealed that there is a single transcriptional start site located at 127 bases upstream from the translation start codon in the mouse PLC-delta1 gene. DNA sequence analysis showed that the sequence around the transcriptional start site is very GC-rich and has no TATA or CAAT boxes. Transient expression of a luciferase reporter gene under the control of serially deleted 5'-flanking sequences revealed that the 160-base-pair region from -622 to -462 upstream of the transcriptional start site includes a positive cis-acting element(s) for the efficient expression of the PLC-delta1 gene. Gel retardation analysis suggests that multiple transcription factors bind to separate sites on the promoter region. Based on these results, our study suggests that the minimal essential region located at -622 to +70 is fully sufficient to confer high-level transcriptional activity and contains high-affinity binding elements for multiple transcription factors. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
220;21059769;A panel of human cell-based artificial APC enables the expansion of long-lived antigen-specific CD4+ T cells restricted by prevalent HLA-DR alleles.;"Many preclinical experiments have attested to the critical role of CD4(+) T cell help in CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immunity. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that reinfusion of CD4(+) T cells can induce responses in infectious diseases and cancer. However, few standardized and versatile systems exist to expand antigen-specific CD4(+) T(h) for clinical use. K562 is a human erythroleukemic cell line, which lacks expression of HLA class I and class II, invariant chain and HLA-DM but expresses adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and leukocyte function-associated antigen-3. With this unique immunologic phenotype, K562 has been tested in clinical trials of cancer immunotherapy. Previously, we created a K562-based artificial antigen-presenting cell (aAPC) that generates ex vivo long-lived HLA-A2-restricted CD8(+) CTL with a central/effector memory phenotype armed with potent effector function. We successfully generated a clinical version of this aAPC and conducted a clinical trial where large numbers of anti-tumor CTL are reinfused to cancer patients. In this article, we shifted focus to CD4(+) T cells and developed a panel of novel K562-derived aAPC, where each expresses a different single HLA-DR allele, invariant chain, HLA-DM, CD80, CD83 and CD64; takes up soluble protein by endocytosis and processes and presents CD4(+) T-cell peptides. Using this aAPC, we were able to determine novel DR-restricted CD4(+) T-cell epitopes and expand long-lived CD4(+) T-cells specific for multiple antigens without growing bystander Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells. Our results suggest that K562-based aAPC may serve as a translatable platform to generate both antigen-specific CD8(+) CTL and CD4(+) T(h).";-;antigen;-;hard_2
221;8757987;Persistent infection of African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) with SAT-type foot-and-mouth disease viruses: rate of fixation of mutations, antigenic change and interspecies transmission.;"Transmission of a plaque-purified SAT-2 foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) occurred erratically from artificially infected African buffaloes in captivity to susceptible buffaloes and cattle in the same enclosure; in some instances transmission occurred only after contact between persistently infected carriers and susceptible animals lasting a number of months. Because the rate at which FMDV mutations accumulated in persistently infected buffaloes was approximately linear (1.64 percent nucleotide substitutions per year over the region of the 1D gene sequenced), both buffaloes and cattle that became infected some months after the start of the experiment were infected with viruses that differed from the original clone. The nucleotide differences were reflected in significant antigenic change. A SAT-1 FMDV from a separate experiment inadvertently infected some of the buffalo in the SAT-2 experiment. The SAT-1 FMDV also accumulated mutations at a constant rate in individual buffaloes (1.54 percent nucleotide changes per year) but the resultant antigenic variation was less than for SAT-2. It is concluded that persistently infected buffaloes in the wild constantly generate variants of SAT-1 and SAT-2 which explains the wide range of genomic and antigenic variants which occur in SAT-1 and SAT-2 viruses in southern Africa.";-;antigen;-;hard_2

225;2283999;Glucocorticoid inhibition of transcription from adenovirus major late promoter.;Glucocorticoids inhibit proliferation of lymphosarcoma P1798 cells in culture. This is accompanied by inhibition of expression of class I as well as some class II genes. We have used the technique of transcription in vitro and the adenovirus major late promoter (AdMLP) to investigate molecular mechanisms of glucocorticoid inhibition of transcription of class II genes. Nuclear extracts from exponentially growing P1798 cells support faithful transcription from AdMLP. However, treatment of P1798 cells with 10(-7) M dexamethasone (a synthetic glucocorticoid) for 24 h impairs the ability of nuclear extracts prepared from such cells to support faithful transcription from AdMLP. Transcription from the human histone H4 gene promoter is unaffected by dexamethasone treatment. Gel mobility shift assays using synthetic oligonucleotide probe indicate no difference in the CAAT box binding activity of control and dexamethasone-treated cell extracts. Similarly, dexamethasone treatment does not affect the upstream stimulatory factor activity of P1798 cells. Furthermore, up-stream stimulatory factor purified from control cell extracts is unable to reconstitute the glucocorticoid-treated cell extracts for transcription from AdMLP. Fractionation of the control cell extracts on Sepharose S yields two protein fractions, neither of which supports transcription from AdMLP. However, one of these fractions, S-II, confers upon glucocorticoid-treated cell extracts the ability to support faithful transcription from AdMLP. We conclude that glucocorticoids regulate the transcription from AdMLP by regulating the activity of a trans-acting transcription factor which copurifies with fraction S-II.;-;transcription factor;-;hard_2
229;6191725;Keratin polypeptide profile in psoriatic epidermis normalized by treatment with etretinate (aromatic retinoid Ro 10-9359).;The variations in the expression of epidermal keratins occurring during retinoid therapy were studied in patients with psoriasis before and during oral administration of etretinate (aromatic retinoid Ro 10-9359) and compared with normal epidermis. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis densitometric readings were performed on keratins extracted from epidermal cells obtained through trypsinization of skin specimens. Epidermal cells were also tested by immunofluorescence (IF) for the presence of BMZ antigens as markers of basal cells and for the presence of TK and KP (67 K, 63 K, and 55 K) with sera with antibodies against BMZ antigens and specific antisera for TK and KP. In psoriasis-involved epidermis, SDS-PAGE anaLysis showed lower amounts of 67 K and increased amounts of 63 K and 55 K, as compared with normal epidermis. Low proportions of cells expressing by IF the 67 K and the 63 K were also noted, with a defective expression of these two KP by suprabasal keratinocytes in psoriasis-involved epidermis. During etretinate administration, a return toward the normal electrophoretic pattern and a correction of the defective cellular expression of these two KP were obtained parallel with clinical improvement. These findings indicate the presence in involved psoriatic epidermis of a population of suprabasal keratinocytes that do not express the high-molecular-weight KP and show a normalization of the relative proportions of the KP with etretinate.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
231;30787192;Assembly and cryo-EM structures of RNA-specific measles virus nucleocapsids provide mechanistic insight into paramyxoviral replication.;Assembly of paramyxoviral nucleocapsids on the RNA genome is an essential step in the viral cycle. The structural basis of this process has remained obscure due to the inability to control encapsidation. We used a recently developed approach to assemble measles virus nucleocapsid-like particles on specific sequences of RNA hexamers (poly-Adenine and viral genomic 5') in vitro, and determined their cryoelectron microscopy maps to 3.3-Å resolution. The structures unambiguously determine 5' and 3' binding sites and thereby the binding-register of viral genomic RNA within nucleocapsids. This observation reveals that the 3' end of the genome is largely exposed in fully assembled measles nucleocapsids. In particular, the final three nucleotides of the genome are rendered accessible to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex, possibly enabling efficient RNA processing. The structures also reveal local and global conformational changes in the nucleoprotein upon assembly, in particular involving helix α6 and helix α13 that form edges of the RNA binding groove. Disorder is observed in the bound RNA, localized at one of the two backbone conformational switch sites. The high-resolution structure allowed us to identify putative nucleobase interaction sites in the RNA-binding groove, whose impact on assembly kinetics was measured using real-time NMR. Mutation of one of these sites, R195, whose sidechain stabilizes both backbone and base of a bound nucleic acid, is thereby shown to be essential for nucleocapsid-like particle assembly. ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
239;7287079;Quantitative variation in H-2-antigen expression. II. Evidence for a dominance pattern in H-2K and H-2D expression in F1 hybrid mice.;Further evidence for quantitative variation in H-2-antigen expression in F1 hybrids is described. Spleen cells from nine different F1 hybrids were compared with parental strain cells for differences in H-2K- and H-2D-antigen expression by quantitative absorption analysis and in an 125I-radioimmunoassay using anti-H-2 sera. Some K and D antigens are expressed in two to three times smaller amounts in F1 hybrids, while others are approximately equally expressed. There was no evidence for either I-region control or parental influence in the genetic control of H-2-antigen expression. Expression of K and D antigens in an F1 hybrid (compared with parental cells) is dependent on the K and D allelic composition of the hybrid, in that some alleles tend to dominate over others. In four different F1 hybrids, Kk was more strongly expressed than Kb, while, in other F1 hybrids, Kd predominated over both Kk and Kb. Similarly, Db dominated over Dd in five different F1 hybrids, while no obvious dominance pattern was found in F1 hybrids carrying Dk.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
240;16461930;Evidence that the mouse insulin receptor substrate-1 belongs to the gene family on which the promoter is activated by estrogen receptor alpha through its interaction with Sp1.;In the present study, the molecular mechanism underlying the up-regulatory effect of estradiol (E2) on mouse insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) promoter was investigated in CHO cells on which the same promoter had first been functionally characterized. The mouse IRS-1 promoter bears four consensus half Estrogen Responsive Elements (ERE) sequences and thirteen AP-1- and ten Sp1-binding elements. We performed molecular dissection of this promoter gene providing 3' different deleted constructs, containing the same AP-1 rich region with a progressively increased number of ERE half sites located downstream. None of these constructs was responsive to E2, while a downstream region (nt -1420 to -160) rich in GC elements was induced by E2. However, the latter region lost its intrinsic E2 responsiveness when the whole IRS-1 promoter was mutated for deletion in all four ERE half sites. Deletion analysis of the ERE half sites demonstrated that only ERE located at the position -1500 to -1495, close to the GC-rich region, was able to maintain the induced activatory effect of E2 on the IRS-1 gene. Electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays identified the region containing the half ERE/Sp1 (nt -1500 to -1477) as the one conferring E2 responsiveness to the whole promoter. This effect occurs through the functional interaction between E2/ERalpha and Sp1.;polycysteine;-;-;LCR_without_function
242;24069162;Rasputin functions as a positive regulator of orb in Drosophila oogenesis.;The determination of cell fate and the establishment of polarity axes during Drosophila oogenesis depend upon pathways that localize mRNAs within the egg chamber and control their on-site translation. One factor that plays a central role in regulating on-site translation of mRNAs is Orb. Orb is a founding member of the conserved CPEB family of RNA-binding proteins. These proteins bind to target sequences in 3' UTRs and regulate mRNA translation by modulating poly(A) tail length. In addition to controlling the translation of axis-determining mRNAs like grk, fs(1)K10, and osk, Orb protein autoregulates its own synthesis by binding to orb mRNA and activating its translation. We have previously shown that Rasputin (Rin), the Drosophila homologue of Ras-GAP SH3 Binding Protein (G3BP), associates with Orb in a messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complex. Rin is an evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding protein believed to function as a link between Ras signaling and RNA metabolism. Here we show that Orb and Rin form a complex in the female germline. Characterization of a new rin allele shows that rin is essential for oogenesis. Co-localization studies suggest that Orb and Rin form a complex in the oocyte at different stages of oogenesis. This is supported by genetic and biochemical analyses showing that rin functions as a positive regulator in the orb autoregulatory pathway by increasing Orb protein expression. Tandem Mass Spectrometry analysis shows that several canonical stress granule proteins are associated with the Orb-Rin complex suggesting that a conserved mRNP complex regulates localized translation during oogenesis in Drosophila.  ;polyalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
245;8125529;Induction of the lytic viral cycle in Epstein Barr virus carrying Burkitt lymphoma lines is accompanied by increased expression of major histocompatibility complex molecules.;Six Epstein Barr virus (EBV) genome-carrying Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cultures (P3HR-1, Raji, Akata, Daudi, Rael and Jijoye) were induced to enter the lytic cycle. Phorbol esther (TPA), n-butyrate, 5-azacytidine (5AzaC) or anti-IgG were used according to their known inducing capacity on these cell lines. Concomitantly with the appearance of the viral early antigens (EA) in a proportion of cells, the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens increased in the cultures. On P3HR-1 and Raji cells class I expression also increased. The enhancement of MHC expression correlated with the efficiency of induction and required only an early event of the viral lytic cycle. Treatment of 3 EBV-negative lymphoma lines (BJAB, Ramos and BL41) with TPA plus n-butyrate or 5AzaC did not influence MHC expression. Moreover, BL lines which carry the EBV genome after having been infected in vitro and which cannot be induced for the viral lytic cycle did not change MHC expression after treatment with the inducing agents. In mixed cultures the allo-stimulatory capacity of induced cells with elevated MHC expression was stronger compared to the untreated ones.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
246;8195188;Transcriptional regulation of the human neuropeptide Y gene by nerve growth factor.;Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is the most ubiquitously expressed peptide in the mammalian nervous system. Transcription of the NPY gene in PC12 cells is regulated by a number of agents, including the neurotrophic peptide nerve growth factor (NGF). In this paper, we define the cis-acting promoter elements which respond to NGF and characterize the trans-acting factors which interact with these sequences. The NGF-responsive elements of the NPY gene lie between nucleotides -87 and -36. At least four proteins interact with this promoter region. One of these proteins interacts with a CT-rich sequence centered at position -51, which closely abuts a binding site for transcription factor AP-2 centered at position -63. Two newly characterized factors bind between positions -87 and -58. These proteins are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and, together with the other binding activities, modulate the transcriptional activity of the NPY gene.

The cDNAs encoding immunoreactive fusion polypeptides were then used to rescreen the library by plaque hybridization. Nucleotide sequencing of overlapping cDNA clones revealed an open translation reading frame of 1326 bases beginning at an initiation start sequence and ending at a stop codon. The contiguous cDNA sequence contains a 3'-untranslated region of 563 bases with a possible polyadenylation site 16 bases upstream from the poly(A) tail. Primer extension of chick aortic mRNA taken together with the sequence data, reveals a 5'-untranslated region of 95 bases extending upstream from the translation start site. Northern blot analyses indicated that the isolated cDNA hybridized with a 2.1-kilobase mRNA in preparations of whole chick embryo and chick embryonic aortic, heart, and muscle RNAs. The initial translation protein encoded by the cDNA is 53,932 kDa and possesses a hydrophilic amino acid composition with glutamic acid comprising 22% of the total amino acid residues.

Assuming that all thymocytes bear similar amounts of Ia antigens, we estimated that they have approximately 1/50 the amount of Ia antigens that spleen cells do.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
274;8082656;Cytoskeletal reorganization in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts expressing the ras oncogene.;"Expression of the Ha-ras oncogene in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts leads to a set point shift of cell volume regulation and causes an increase in cell volume by activation of Na+/H+ exchange and Na+, K+, 2Cl- cotransport. Since both ion transport systems are thought to be governed by the cytoskeleton, the aim of this study was to examine the alterations in growth characteristics and cytoskeletal organization due to the expression of the oncogene. The experiments were performed on NIH 3T3 fibroblasts transfected with a transforming Ha-ras MMTV-LTR construct and expressing the oncogene after treatment with low serum medium and 1 mumol/l dexamethasone (+ras cells). Transfected cells not expressing the oncogene (-ras cells) and treated with low serum medium, but without the addition of dexamethasone, served as controls. The growth characteristics were examined and the cytoskeletal architecture was visualized by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using specific antibodies and fluorescent dyes. Expression of the ras oncogene was accompanied by a significant and serum-independent increase in proliferative activity irrespective from the coating of the dishes with attachment factors (poly-L-lysine, collagen type I). Both, -ras and +ras cells, proliferated slower on substrates coated with poly-L-lysine than on tissue culture plastic or collagen type I. Expression of the ras oncogene also resulted in a significant increase in cell volume which was independent from the substrate. +ras Cells became more elongated, exhibited long cytoplasmic protrusions and tended to detach when compared with -ras cells. Examination of the cytoskeletal architecture in +ras and -ras cells revealed marked differences such as a depolymerization of the stress fiber network to strongly fluorescent ""focals"" as well as the absence of vinculin-containing attachment plaques (focal contacts), a disorganization of non-muscle myosin and of cell surface fibronectin in +ras cells. In addition, a retraction of microtubules and vimentin filaments to the perinuclear region was also observed in +ras cells. For comparison, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts which were not transfected with the ras oncogene (0ras cells) and which were also subjected to the experimental conditions described above (low serum medium +/- dexamethasone), did not exhibit the cytoskeletal alterations as observed for +ras cells. The results demonstrate that the expression of ras oncogene causes not only profound alterations in the proliferative activity, cell volume and cell morphology, but also a marked reorganization of cytoskeletal architecture, which may participate in the altered regulation of volume-regulatory ion transporters in the cell membrane.";-;-;poly-L-;hard_1
277;8670298;A family of novel DNA-binding nuclear proteins having polypyrimidine tract-binding motif and arginine/serine-rich motif.;NP220 is a DNA-binding nuclear protein originally cloned from human cell lines. Human NP220 (hNP220) has an arginine/serine-rich motif found in non-small nuclear RNP splicing factors (SR proteins) and shares three domains (MH1, MH2 and MH3) with an acidic nuclear matrix protein, matrin 3. The MH2 domain repeats three times and has homology to the polypyrimidine tract-binding motif of heterogeneous nuclear RNP I/L. NP220 also has a DNA-binding domain and nine repeats of the sequence LVTVDEVIEEEDL (acidic repeat). We have now isolated mouse equivalents of NP220 (mNP220s) and found that NP220s form a family of proteins with four members produced by alternative splicing of a common pre-mRNA. Two longer forms (NP220alpha and NP220beta) have all functional domains mentioned above while two shorter forms (NP220gamma and NP220delta) lack the DNA-binding domain and the acidic repeat. The structural aspects of NP220s are distinct from that of the SR proteins but rather resemble U2AF and Tra2 which activate a specific 3'-splicing site of specific genes in response to differentiation-dependent signals.;polyserine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
278;1717443;A novel species of cytochrome P-450 (P-450ib) specific for the small intestine of rabbits. cDNA cloning and its expression in COS cells.;We have isolated a cDNA clone for a P-450, designated P-450ib (Ichihara, K., Kusunose, E., Kaku, M., Yamamoto, S., and Kusunose, M. (1985) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 831, 99-105), from a cDNA library of rabbit small intestine mucosa by using synthetic DNA fragment by the polymerase chain reaction, as a hybridization probe. The cDNA with a 1,829-base pair insert encodes a polypeptide of 501 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence contains all of the sequences of the NH2-terminal and 14 tryptic fragments from purified P-450ib. As the NH2-terminal methionine was not found in the sequence from the purified protein, the apoprotein of P-450ib is composed of 500 amino acids with a molecular weight of 57,193. P-450ib shows 35-41% sequence similarity with several members of 8 subfamilies in the P-450 II family, whereas it has a less than 30% sequence similarity with other P-450 families, suggesting that this P-450 is the first member of a novel subfamily within the P-450 II family. RNA blot analysis shows that mRNA hybridized to the cDNA is expressed in the small intestine, but not significantly in other tissues including liver, colon, kidney, lung, spleen, brain, stomach, and cecum, indicating that P-450ib is a P-450 specific to the small intestine. The protein expressed in COS-7 cells using the cDNA in an expression vector, pKCRH2, shows benzphetamine N-demethylase activity and gives a band identical with that of P-450ib in its mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1

Soluble molecular-weight markers.;Glutaraldehyde is well known for its ability to react with proteins and to produce insoluble cross-linked aggregates. In contrast with this situation, conditions are described here which yield covalently linked soluble protein oligomers. The procedure is applicable to a wide range of proteins, and by slight variation in the reaction conditions, soluble polymers in the molecular weight range 3x10(4)-2x10(7) were produced. The products are valuable as molecular-weight markers, e.g. in sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. The inherent similarities of these oligomers make them superior to commercial molecular-weight protein markers, which may have marked differences in composition and charge.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
281;1323706;Substitution of a TATA box from a herpes simplex virus late gene in the viral thymidine kinase promoter alters ICP4 inducibility but not temporal expression.;The role of cis-acting promoter elements associated with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) early and late genes was evaluated during productive infection with regard to activation of gene expression by the HSV-1 transactivator ICP4 and control of temporal regulation. A set of recombinant viruses was constructed such that expression of an HSV-1 early gene, thymidine kinase (tk), was placed under the control of either the tk TATA box or the TATA box from the late gene, glycoprotein C (gC), in the presence or absence of the upstream Sp1 and CCAAT sites normally found in the tk promoter. The presence of Sp1 sites in the promoter or replacement of the tk TATA box with the gC TATA box resulted in a decreased activation of tk mRNA expression by ICP4. Substitution of the A + T-rich region from the gC TATA box in the context of the remainder of the surrounding tk sequences resulted in a promoter that bound recombinant TATA-binding protein (TBP) better at lower concentrations than the wild-type tk promoter did. These results indicate that tk promoters that are better able to utilize TBP are less responsive to ICP4 activation and suggest that activation by ICP4 involves the general transcription factors that interact with TBP or TBP itself. Additionally, all of the viruses expressed tk at early times postinfection, indicating that cis-acting promoter elements that control the level of expression of HSV-1 early and late genes do not determine temporal regulation.;polythreonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel-filled capillary column for the determination of recombinant biotechnology-derived proteins.;Fused-silica capillary columns were filled with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and the column effluent was monitored at 214 nm using a commercially available high-performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE) instrument to separate and rapidly quantify recombinant biotechnology-derived proteins. An excellent linear relationship (r greater than 0.999) exists between the peak migration time and the molecular weights of reference proteins in the range 10,000-100,000 and 40,000-200,000 dalton by use of the capillary columns filled with acrylamide gel at a T composition of 5% and 3%, respectively. The relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) of the peak migration time is ca. 1%. Theoretical plates of 5 X 10(5)-1 X 10(6) per metre are routinely being obtained. Calibration graphs of peak area versus weight of recombinant biotechnology-derived proteins are linear (r greater than 0.999) and the proteins may be quantified with an R.S.D. of ca. 3-7%. As little as 50 nmol of a protein may be quantified and an impurity peak of molecular weight ca. 1500 less than that of the parent compound (ca. 60,000 dalton) may be differentiated by HPCE with a gel-filled capillary column.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
284;10447;Properties of two isolated antigens associated with bovine leukemia virus infection.;"We isolated an ether-resistant internal antigen and an ether-sensitive antigen previously described in relation to bovine leukemia virus infection. These two antigens have now been isolated by isoelectric focusing and concanavalin A affinity chromatography, respectively. The ether-resistant antigen exhibited isoelectric heterogeneity with a major peak at pH 7.2 and a minor peak at pH 6.2. Its molecular weight, estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), was 23,000 (p23), and it gave a sedimentation value of 2.3s. For material containing ether-sensitive antigen, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, protein staining revealed four components with molecular weights of 18,000, 25,000, 45,000, and 55,000. Two of these [45,000 (gp45) and 55,000 (gp55)] were stained by periodic acid-Schiff reagent.

286;29386753;HIF1α-Induced Glycolysis Metabolism Is Essential to the Activation of Inflammatory Macrophages.;Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1α is a metabolic regulator that plays an important role in immunologic responses. Previous studies have demonstrated that HIF1α participates in the M1 polarization of macrophages. To clarify the mechanism of HIF1α-induced polarization of M1 macrophage, myeloid-specific HIF1α overexpression (Lysm HIF1α lsl) mice were employed and the bone marrow-derived and peritoneal macrophages were isolated. RT-PCR results revealed that HIF1α overexpression macrophage had a hyperinflammatory state characterized by the upregulation of M1 markers. Cellular bioenergetics analysis showed lower cellular oxygen consumption rates in the Lysm HIF1α lsl mice. Metabolomics studies showed that HIF1α overexpression led to increased glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway intermediates. Further results revealed that macrophage M1 polarization, induced by HIF1α overexpression, was via upregulating the mRNA expression of the genes related to the glycolysis metabolism. Our results indicate that HIF1α promoted macrophage glycolysis metabolism, which induced M1 polarization in mice.;-;-;-;hard_0
287;1775128;High level expression of the major transactivation domain of the human glucocorticoid receptor in yeast cells inhibits endogenous gene expression and cell growth.;A number of alternative mechanisms by which the DNA-bound glucocorticoid receptor transactivates gene expression have been suggested. The fact that the glucocorticoid and other steroid hormone receptors function in yeast suggests that at least one of these mechanisms has been conserved throughout evolution. Here we show that overexpression of one of the glucocorticoid receptor transactivation domains (tau 1) in yeast causes a reduction in expression of a yeast reporter gene, followed by a severe reduction in the growth rate of the yeast cells. This is analogous to the phenomenon of squelching, first described for the GAL4 protein, and suggests that the tau 1 domain of the glucocorticoid receptor functions by contacting limiting transcription factors needed for efficient gene activity. A similar level of squelching was seen after removal of the up-stream activation sequences from the yeast reporter gene, suggesting that the squelching interactions were with transcription factors needed for the activity of a basal promoter.;-;transcription factor;-;hard_2
291;27388480;Mapping surface residues of eIF5A that are important for binding to the ribosome using alanine scanning mutagenesis.;The translation elongation factor eIF5A is conserved through evolution and is necessary to rescue the ribosome during translation elongation of polyproline-containing proteins. Although the site of eIF5A binding to the ribosome is known, no systematic analysis has been performed so far to determine the important residues on the surface of eIF5A required for ribosome binding. In this study, we used clustered charged-to-alanine mutagenesis and structural modeling to address this question. We generated four new mutants of yeast eIF5A: tif51A-4, tif51A-6, tif51A-7 and tif51A-11, and complementation analysis revealed that tif51A-4 and tif51A-7 could not sustain cell growth in a strain lacking wild-type eIF5A. Moreover, the allele tif51A-4 also displayed negative dominance over wild-type eIF5A. Both in vivo GST-pulldowns and in vitro fluorescence anisotropy demonstrated that eIF5A from mutant tif51A-7 exhibited an importantly reduced affinity for the ribosome, implicating the charged residues in cluster 7 as determinant features on the eIF5A surface for contacting the ribosome. Notably, modified eIF5A from mutant tif51A-4, despite exhibiting the most severe growth phenotype, did not abolish ribosome interactions as with mutant tif51A-7. Taking into account the modeling eIF5A + 80S + P-tRNA complex, our data suggest that interactions of eIF5A with ribosomal protein L1 are more important to stabilize the interaction with the ribosome as a whole than the contacts with P-tRNA. Finally, the ability of eIF5A from tif51A-4 to bind to the ribosome while potentially blocking physical interaction with P-tRNA could explain its dominant negative phenotype.;polyproline;-;-;LCR_without_function
292;6193064;Antigenic specificity and heterogeneity of lipopolysaccharides from pyocin-sensitive and -resistant strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae.;Homologous antisera were raised against lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) isolated from pyocin 103-sensitive JW31 strain Neisseria gonorrhoeae and its isogenic, pyocin-resistant variant, JW31R. Changes in immunochemical reactivity of LPS antigen associated with pyocin-resistance were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, employing homologous and heterologous anti-LPS immune sera. The acquisition of pyocin 103 resistance is accompanied by a loss in LPS antigen reactivity with homologous anti-LPS. The variant LPS of pyocin 103-resistant mutants is immunogenic and displays a new, distinct antigenic specificity shared with other pyocin 103-resistant variant gonococcal strains. The acquisition of pyocin 103 resistance by JW31 strain gonococci is also accompanied by a striking loss of LPS cross-reactivity with antistreptococcal polysaccharide reagents having an antibody combining site specificity directed against the chemically defined lactose polymer from Streptococcus faecalis cell wall and pneumococcal type 14 capsular polysaccharide. When examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, JW31 and JW31R LPSs show banding patterns characteristic of microheterogeneous, rough-type LPS devoid of O-side chains. Immunoblot transfer analysis of gel-separated gonococcal LPS antigens shows a difference in the pattern of antibody binding by homologous versus cross-reactive anti-LPS, which suggests a heterogeneity in the distribution of cross-reactive determinants among LPS molecules.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
293;8207791;Alphaherpesvirus origin-binding protein homolog encoded by human herpesvirus 6B, a betaherpesvirus, binds to nucleotide sequences that are similar to ori regions of alphaherpesviruses.;We previously identified a human herpesvirus 6B (HHV-6B) homolog of the alphaherpesvirus origin-binding protein (OBP), exemplified by the herpes simplex virus type 1 UL9 gene product. This finding is of particular interest because HHV-6B is otherwise more closely related to members of the betaherpesvirus subfamily. The prototypic betaherpesvirus, human cytomegalovirus, does not encode an obvious OBP homolog and contains a more complex origin of replication than do alphaherpesviruses. Thus, analysis of the function of the HHV-6B OBP homolog is essential for understanding the mechanism of HHV-6B DNA replication initiation. The HHV-6B OBP homolog, OBPH6B, was expressed in vitro by coupled transcription and translation and in insect cells by infection with recombinant baculoviruses. The expressed protein bound to two DNA sequences located upstream of the HHV-6B major DNA-binding protein gene homolog, within a region that was predicted to serve as an origin of replication on the basis of its sequence properties. The binding sites lie within 23-bp segments and are similar to OBP-binding sites of herpes simplex virus type 1. The two OBPH6B-binding sequences are separated by an AT-rich region and have an imperfect dyad symmetry as do the alphaherpesvirus origin regions. We identified OBPH6B transcripts by reverse transcription PCR in HHV-6B-infected Molt-3 cells. These results suggest that OBPH6B functions in a manner analogous to the alphaherpesvirus OBP and that initiation of HHV-6B DNA replication may resemble that of alphaherpesviruses.;polythreonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

The complete data set is divided into subsets based on 4D-molecular similarity measures using cluster analysis. The compounds in each cluster subset are further divided into a training set and a test set. Predictive QASAR models are constructed for each cluster subset using the corresponding training sets. These QSAR models best predict test set compounds which are assigned to the same cluster subset, based on the 4D-molecular similarity measures, from which the models are derived. The results suggest that the specific properties governing blood-brain barrier permeability may vary across chemically diverse compounds. Partitioning compounds into chemically similar classes is essential to constructing predictive blood-brain barrier penetration models embedding the corresponding key physiochemical properties of a given chemical class.;-;-;-;hard_0
298;2029908;Assembly and disulfide rearrangement of recombinant surfactant protein A in vitro.;The surfactant-associated protein, protein A, produced by transgenic Chinese hamster ovary cells exhibits a heterogeneous population of structures. Electron microscopy reveals lollipop-shaped monomers consisting of a collagenous triple helix and a globular domain as well as oligomers in which two, three or more protomers are connected by their collagenous stalks. Each protomer consists of three alpha-chains (36 kDa) but under non-reducing conditions few free alpha-chains are observed by SDS/PAGE. Instead gamma-components (three chains), gamma 2 (six chains) and higher components are observed which are derived from intra- and inter-protomer disulfide cross-linking. Complete reduction at low temperature dissociates the oligomers, but preserves the intact structure of monomers as demonstrated by electron microscopy and trypsin digestion. Circular dichroism revealed an unfolding of the collagen triple helices of fully reduced protein A at 26 degrees C and of the unreduced protein A around 41.5 degrees C. Reoxidation of the fully reduced protein A re-established mainly the disulfide bonds within the triple helix but not between monomers. Very few higher assembly forms were reformed even at high protein A concentrations.

299;7150562;Acumentin, an actin-modulating protein of rabbit pulmonary macrophages.;An actin-modulating protein has been purified from rabbit alveolar macrophages utilizing DEAE-Sepharose and gel filtration chromatography. The purified protein which we have named acumentin is similar in structure and function to a protein found in human granulocytes [Southwick, F.S., & Stossel, T.P. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 3030-3036] and has a Stokes radius of 34 A and s20,w of 4.02 S, consistent with a globular protein with a native molecular weight of 63 500. Acumentin has a molecular weight of 65 000 as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. This protein is present in high concentrations in macrophages, representing about 6% of the total protein in cytoplasmic extracts. Acumentin caps the pointed end of actin filaments labeled with heavy meromyosin [Southwick, F.S., & Hartwig, J.H. (1982) Nature (London) 297, 303-307], thereby decreasing the final viscosity of monomeric actin polymerized in its presence without detectably increasing the critical monomer concentration. The activity of this protein is inhibited by KCl concentrations above 0.1 M and is completely inactive at a KCl concentration of 0.3 M. Acumentin's function is equivalent in the presence or absence of CaCl2. The presence of such a calcium-insensitive capping protein in both the human granulocyte and rabbit alveolar macrophage suggests acumentin may be of general importance in constitutively maintaining a shortened actin filament length distribution in the cytoplasm of the nonmuscle cell.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
302;8195146;Identification and characterization of SPRK, a novel src-homology 3 domain-containing proline-rich kinase with serine/threonine kinase activity.;Protein kinase play important roles in the growth and differentiation of cells. We have isolated cDNA clones from the human megakaryocytic cell line CMK11-5 that encode a novel protein kinase, which we call SPRK (src-homology 3 (SH3) domain-containing proline-rich kinase). The gene sequence predicts an 847-amino acid protein kinase with a unique domain arrangement. An amino-terminal glycine-rich region is followed by an SH3 domain and a kinase domain that is similar to both tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases. Adjacent to the kinase domain are two closely spaced leucine/isoleucine zipper motifs and a stretch of basic amino acids that resembles karyophilic nuclear localization signals. The COOH-terminal half of SPRK is basic, and proline accounts for 24% of the COOH-terminal 216 amino acids. The sprk gene is widely expressed as a 4-kilobase transcript in adult and fetal human tissues. Transfection of 293 cells with a vector encoding an epitope-tagged SPRK results in the expression of a 95-kDa protein. The epitope-tagged SPRK becomes phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues in an in vitro kinase assay, whereas SPRK variants with point mutations in the predicted ATP-binding site fail to become phosphorylated. These data indicate that SPRK has serine/threonine kinase activity. The SH3 domain of SPRK is interrupted by a unique 5-amino acid insert whose location in the SH3 consensus sequence is the same as that of the inserts found in the SH3 domains of neuronal SRC and of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.;polyproline;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function

Some Neotropical species have taxonomic issues, as is the case with Gnamptogenys striatula, for which morphological variations have been observed between different populations. For the ant species with taxonomic issues, classical and molecular cytogenetic studies have assisted in the resolution of these issues. Cytogenetic studies of Gnamptogenys are scarce and have only been reported for 14 taxa. These reports have rarely presented chromosomal morphology. Considering the importance of the taxonomic revision of some species, such as G. striatula, the present study cytogenetically characterized four species of Gnamptogenys: G. striatula, G. moelleri, G. regularis, and G. triangularis, discussing their phylogenetic and biogeographic characteristics. The number of chromosomes ranged from 2n = 26 to 2n = 44, with distinct karyotypes at both species and population levels. All four species presented a pair of 18S rDNA gene markers that coincided with GC-rich regions. In the case of G. striatula from the Atlantic rainforest, a chromosomal polymorphism was observed, with chromosomal translocations being the likely origin of this polymorphism. Two populations of G. striatula showed karyotype differences, thus corroborating previous morphological data indicating the existence of a species complex in this taxon. In addition, G. regularis showed a polymorphism involving a chromosome pair bearing ribosomal genes, possibly caused by unequal crossing-over. Although G. moelleri has a well-defined taxonomy, a population from the eastern Amazon rainforest presented a divergent karyotype from the Atlantic rainforest populations, suggesting the existence of a cryptic species in this taxon.;polycysteine;-;-;LCR_without_function
305;6119056;Proteinuria after burn injury.;Qualitative and quantitative aspects of the excretion of protein after burn injury have been investigated. The excretion of total protein and of albumin have been measured nephelometrically while the excretion of proteins of both serum and non-serum origin have been measured by immunoelectrophoresis using antiserum against serum proteins or against a pool of urine from burned patients. Comparison of the patterns of proteins observed in urine using these two different antisera showed the presence of at least three major proteins that did not originate from the plasma. The excretion of two of these three proteins followed closely the pattern of total protein excretion which reached a maximum at five to seven days after injury. The excretion of albumin was greatest in the first 48 hours after injury. Examination of the original burn patients' urine antigen by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that this urine pool contained greater amounts of lower molecular weight proteins than were observed in a pool of normal urines. The observations suggest that a biphasic renal pathophysiology is observed after burn injury.

To overcome methodological problems of this assay system, we have developed a direct radioimmunoassay for this plasma protein using renin substrate purified from pooled plasma of normotensive subjects as the antigen. Comparison of substrate quantitated by the two assay systems (direct and indirect) indicates a 1:1 correlation with the exception of certain subjects with elevated substrate levels induced by estrogen therapy. To study the possibility of multiple substrate forms, we have made a comparison of substrate quantitated by both radioimmunoassays in conjunction with electrophoresis of plasma on polyacrylamide gel. One major form of substrate with a retardation factor (Rf) = 0.60 was found in normotensive and essential hypertensive subjects which gave a 1:1 correspondence on quantitation by the two methods. In contrast, six of 16 women on oral contraceptives demonstrated three forms of substrate (Rf = 0.16, 0.35, and 0.60) on electrophoresis.

We identified eight children (six girls and two boys) with PNT. Their ages ranged from 19 to 139 months (median 47.5 months, mean:64.75 months). Skin lesions had been present for 2-24 weeks (median: 4 weeks) before diagnosis. All patients displayed scattered papulo- and/or pustulonecrotic lesions on the limbs, and the ears were involved in six patients. Lesions healed with varioliform scars. Associated pulmonary TB was present in seven patients. Additional clinical findings included fever (n = 4), hepatomegaly (n = 4), lymphadenopathy (n = 3), phlyctenular conjunctivitis (n = 3), and splenomegaly (n = 2). Histology of eight biopsies showed ulceration (n = 6), dermal necrosis (n = 6) (follicle-centered in two), granulomatous inflammation (n = 6) (palisading granuloma-like in three), superficial and deep infiltrate of lymphocytes (n = 7), erythrocyte extravasation (n = 7), and subepidermal edema (n = 3). Vasculitis was not a feature. A Ziehl-Neelsen stain was negative in all. Glycosaminoglycans were not increased. Immunohistochemistry found a predominance of T lymphocytes, macrophages, a few antigen-presenting cells, and no B lymphocytes, consistent with a type IV hypersensitivity reaction. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performed on deparaffinized tissue identified M. tuberculosis DNA in one biopsy. All patients received combination anti-TB treatment for 6 months. Six patients were compliant and were followed up for 6-30 months. Skin lesions and pulmonary TB healed in all. PNT in children resembles the adult form, but phlyctenular conjunctivitis and associated TB are more common, scrofuloderma and concomitant erythema induratum of Bazin are unusual, and vasculitis is not found.

315;6971103;A sensitive solid phase microradioimmunoassay for anti-double stranded DNA antibodies.;A sensitive solid phase microradioimmunoassay has been developed for measurement of antidouble stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies. In this procedure, advantage has been taken of the capacity of poly-L-lysine (PLL) to facilitate the binding of pure dsDNA to plastic surfaces. In the absence of PLL, binding did not occur. Diluted sera were incubated in PLL-treated dsDNA-coated microtitration trays and anti-dsDNA Ig measured using affinity purified 125I-anti-Ig of high specific activity. The synthetic DNA, poly dA-dT, was used as a model for dsDNA. In initial experiments, specific anti-DNA binding could not be demonstrated because of high background binding of patient Ig to PLL-treated surfaces. This was reduced by diluting test sera and anti-Ig in buffer containing 2% BGG and 1% BSA. Specificity of the assay for DNA was demonstrated by absorbing the anti-DNA activity on DNA-coated plastic. The binding of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patient serum Ig to poly dA-dT coated trays did not diminish after digestion with nuclease S1, suggesting that the synthetic polymer is an appropriate model for dsDNA. Patient and normal sera were screened for anti-dsDNA activity using poly dA-dT as antigen. None of the 38 normal sera, 23 of 35 active SLE sera, 1 of 25 treated SLE, 4 of 35 rheumatoid arthritis, 3 of 35 scleroderma, and 1 of 13 polymyositis sera demonstrated positive anti-dsDNA activity.

317;21040421;Two families of Xenopus tropicalis skeletal genes display well-conserved expression patterns with mammals in spite of their highly divergent regulatory regions.;The origin of bone and cartilage, and their subsequent diversification in specific vertebrate lineages, is intimately linked to the precise transcriptional control of genes involved in matrix mineralization. It is not yet clear, however, to which extent the osteoblasts, osteocytes, and chondrocytes of each of the major vertebrate groups express similar sets of genes. In this study we have focused on the evolution of two independent families of genes that code for extracellular matrix components of the skeleton and that include secreted protein, acidic, cysteine-rich (SPARC), bone sialoprotein (BSP) and dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) paralogues, and the osteocalcin (OC) and matrix gla protein (MGP) paralogues. Analyzing developing Xenopus tropicalis skeletal elements, we show that the expression patterns of these genes are well conserved with mammals. The fact that only a few osteoblasts express DMP1, while only some osteocytes express SPARC and BSP, reveals a significant degree of molecular heterogeneity for these two populations of X. tropicalis cells, similarly to what has been described in mouse. Although the cis-regulatory modules (CRM) of the mammalian OC, DMP1, and BSP orthologs have been functionally characterized, we found no evidence of sequence similarity between these regions and the X. tropicalis genome. Furthermore, these regulatory elements evolve rapidly, as they are only poorly conserved between human and rodents. Therefore, the SPARC/DMP1/BSP and the OC/MGP families provide a good paradigm to study how transcriptional output can be maintained in skeletal cells despite extensive sequence divergence of CRM.;polycysteine;-;-;LCR_without_function

Poly(F) formed complexes with poly(U) and poly(I) in the ratio of 1:1 and 1:2, respectively. Poly(L) formed complexes with poly(A) in 2:1 ration and poly(C) in 1:2 and 2:1 ratios in addition to a self-complex. Poly(F) and poly(L) also formed a 1:2 complex between them. Some of these complexes were assumed to contain novel types of base pairings using the 7-NH group.

321;5039283;Dogfish ganglion cell discharge resulting from extrinsic polarization of the horizontal cells.;"1. Ganglion cell discharges were evoked by extrinsic polarization of the horizontal cells in the retina of the smooth dogfish (Mustelus canis). Depolarization of the horizontal cell gave rise to a discharge similar to that evoked by a spot of light (centre type response) and hyperpolarization of the horizontal cell, a discharge similar to that by an annulus (surround type response).2. Procion dye injection established that the current-passing electrode was sometimes located in the external horizontal cell. Other possibilities, such as middle and internal horizontal cells, were neither confirmed nor excluded.3. Activation of ganglion cells by current was possible under completely dark-adapted conditions and for several log units above this level.4. Depolarizing current enhanced the ganglion cell response evoked by a light spot in the centre of its receptive field; hyperpolarizing current antagonized the response to the same flash.5. The results are consistent with the supposition that a potential change in the horizontal cell, irrespective of its polarity, or whether produced by light or current, spreads within a laminar layer (the S-space). The effect of the potential change is to modulate the response of bipolar cells and their input into the ganglion cell.";-;-;-;hard_0
324;8261622;Demonstration of immunoglobulin G with affinity for dopamine in cerebrospinal fluid from psychotic patients.;Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, significantly raised concentrations of immunoglobulin G with affinity for the neurotransmitter dopamine were demonstrated in cerebrospinal fluid from psychotic patients. We have varied the antigen presentation in order to find a conjugate with low unspecific binding. The conjugation of dopamine to carbodiimide-activated poly-L-glutamic acid and that to activated succinimide ester of biotin are described. The use of glutaraldehyde conjugation is not recommended because of the risk of formation of tetrahydroisoquinolines. A strong correlation (r = 0.94, P < 0.001) between the results obtained with dopamine conjugated to poly-L-glutamic acid and dopamine conjugated to biotin was observed. Forty-two human cerebrospinal fluid samples from 20 psychotic patients, (12 with a bipolar disorder and 8 with schizophrenia) and 22 control patients, with various neurological diseases but no apparent psychiatric diseases were investigated.

Immunostaining of SCLC by antikeratin antibody and examination by fluorescence microscopy indicates population heterogeneity in keratin content. Intensity of immunostaining is often weak. However, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting reproducibly demonstrate the presence of keratin and allow analysis of the keratin subtypes. The finding of keratin subtypes closely associated with the development of keratinizing epithelium (the 68 kDa basic keratin) in SCLC was unexpected in a tumor that is regarded as poorly differentiated. The cytoskeletal composition of SCLC suggests the presence of a heterogeneous population with a significant proportion of cells expressing highly differentiated epithelial properties.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
328;6276249;Prolactin receptor turnover in explants of pseudopregnant rabbit mammary gland.;"Pseudopregnant rabbit mammary glands in organ culture were used to investigate prolactin (PRL) receptor turnover. Chloroquine (100 microM) results in an increase in prolactin receptor levels (15.7 +/- 1.2% to 35.9 +/- 3.5% specific binding), whereas cycloheximide (1 microgram/ml) induces a rapid decline (to 6.4 +/- 1.2%) suggesting a rapid synthesis and degradation of the receptor molecule. Inhibitors of cellular transcription have little effect on receptor levels. Neither actinomycin D nor dichlororibofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) diminish PRL receptor levels whereas total protein synthesis is almost completely inhibited, and chloroquine increases the binding even in the presence of transcriptional inhibitors. These results imply that receptor synthesis continues and that the mRNA for the receptor protein is particularly stable. Ouabain (3 micrometers), which blocks the ATP-dependent Na+/K+ pump, provokes a greater than 60% reduction in PRL receptor levels without modifying total protein synthesis. Dinitrophenol (DNP, 1 mM), an oxidative uncoupler, has little effect on receptor levels, possibly due to a blockage of both synthesis and degradation. Prolactin is capable of inducing a 60% down-regulation of its own receptor, and this phenomenon appears to be energy-dependent because it is partially inhibited by DNP. This process seems to involve an increased rate of receptor degradation. These studies suggest that, at any one time, the level of PRL receptors in a target cell is the result of a dynamic equilibrium between receptor synthesis and degradation and that the most frequent modulations occur at the level of translation and lysosomal degradation. In conclusion, in mammary glands of the pseudopregnant rabbit, the prolactin receptor molecule appears to have a short half-life; the mRNA for this protein, however, is relatively stable.";-;-;-;hard_0
330;26383697;Simultaneous expression of regulatory genes associated with specific drought-adaptive traits improves drought adaptation in peanut.;Adaptation of crops to drought-prone rain-fed conditions can be achieved by improving plant traits such as efficient water mining (by superior root characters) and cellular-level tolerance mechanisms. Pyramiding these drought-adaptive traits by simultaneous expression of genes regulating drought-adaptive mechanisms has phenomenal relevance in improving stress tolerance. In this study, we provide evidence that peanut transgenic plants expressing Alfalfa zinc finger 1 (Alfin1), a root growth-associated transcription factor gene, Pennisetum glaucum heat-shock factor (PgHSF4) and Pea DNA helicase (PDH45) involved in protein turnover and protection showed improved tolerance, higher growth and productivity under drought stress conditions. Stable integration of all the transgenes was noticed in transgenic lines. The transgenic lines showed higher root growth, cooler crop canopy air temperature difference (less CCATD) and higher relative water content (RWC) under drought stress. Low proline levels in transgenic lines substantiate the maintenance of higher water status. The survival and recovery of transgenic lines was significantly higher under gradual moisture stress conditions with higher biomass. Transgenic lines also showed significant tolerance to ethrel-induced senescence and methyl viologen-induced oxidative stress. Several stress-responsive genes such as heat-shock proteins (HSPs), RING box protein-1 (RBX1), Aldose reductase, late embryogenesis abundant-5 (LEA5) and proline-rich protein-2 (PRP2), a gene involved in root growth, showed enhanced expression under stress in transgenic lines. Thus, the simultaneous expression of regulatory genes contributing for drought-adaptive traits can improve crop adaptation and productivity under water-limited conditions.  ;polyproline;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
332;6203969;Role of accessory cell processing and presentation of shed H-2 alloantigens in allospecific cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses.;The present study was undertaken to evaluate the role of accessory cell processing of MHC alloantigens in the initiation of primary allospecific CTL responses. To first determine whether antigen processing by accessory cells is involved in the initiation of allospecific CTL responses, accessory cells were retreated with the lysosomotropic drug chloroquine before their addition to culture. It was found that chloroquine pretreatment abrogated their ability to function as accessory cells only when they were of responder haplotype and had no effect when the accessory cells were of stimulator haplotype. Although accessory cells of either responder or stimulator haplotype can initiate allospecific CTL responses, we have previously demonstrated that they do so by activating distinct classes of T helper TH) cells. Indeed, the differential effects of chloroquine on accessory cells of responder or stimulator haplotypes were shown to reflect the fact that chloroquine pretreatment markedly impaired the ability of accessory cells to activate self-Ia-restricted TH cells, but had little effect on the ability of the same accessory cells to activate either allo-class I- or allo-class II-specific TH cells. We next examined the possibility that accessory cells of responder haplotype mediate alloresponses by acquiring and processing shed MHC alloantigens derived from the stimulator cell population. In these experiments, accessory cell-depleted stimulator cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde to inhibit shedding of their surface MHC alloantigens. It was observed that even though mixed stimulator cells were recognized normally by allospecific CTL precursors, they completely failed to stimulate CTL responses mediated by responder haplotype accessory cells, indicating that the function of such accessory cells is dependent upon their acquisition of shed MHC alloantigens. Taken together, the data presented in this report demonstrate that accessory cells of responder haplotype function in allospecific CTL responses by acquiring and processing shed class I MHC alloantigens, and by then presenting the processed alloantigens in association with self-Ia determinants to self-Ia-restricted TH cells. Thus, these data indicate that the self-Ia-restricted TH cells that are involved in allospecific CTL responses recognize processed class I alloantigens in association with self-Ia determinants.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
333;18799624;Actin filament assembly by myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate-phosphatidylinositol-4,5-diphosphate signaling is critical for dendrite branching.;Dendrites undergo extensive growth and branching at early stages, but relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes. Here, we show that increasing the level of myristoylated, alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS), a prominent substrate of protein kinase C and a phosphatidylinositol-4,5-diphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] sequestration protein highly expressed in the brain, enhanced branching and growth of dendrites both in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous MARCKS by RNA interference reduced dendritic arborization. Results from expression of different mutants indicated that membrane binding is essential for MARCKS-induced dendritic morphogenesis. Furthermore, MARCKS increased the number and length of filamentous actin-based filopodia along neurites, as well as the motility of filopodia, in a PI(4,5)P2-dependent manner. Time-lapse imaging showed that MARCKS increased frequency of filopodia initiation but did not affect filopodia longevity, suggesting that MARCKS may increase dendritic branching through its action on filopodia initiation. These findings demonstrate a critical role for MARCKS-PI(4,5)P2 signaling in regulating dendrite development.; polyalanine ;-;-;LCR_without_function

LPS samples isolated from different mutants carrying mutations in the 3.9-kb SmaI-XhoII DNA fragment exhibited banding patterns in silver-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels markedly different from that of the wild-type LPS. Moreover, comparison of the monosaccharide composition obtained by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection of LPS purified from wild-type Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris B100 and from mutants with mutations in the 3.9-kb SmaI-XhoII DNA fragment revealed a lack of rhamnose moieties in the mutant LPS. Sequence analysis of this DNA fragment revealed four open reading frames (ORFs), designated ORF302, ORF183, ORF295, and ORF351. The deduced amino acid sequences of these ORFs showed a high degree of homology to the deduced amino acid sequences of the rfbC, rfbD, rfbA, and rfbB genes of Salmonella typhimurium LT2, which have been shown to encode a set of enzymes responsible for conversion of glucose 1-phosphate to dTDP-rhamnose.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
335;376773;Transfer of specific unresponsiveness to organ allografts by thymocytes. Specific unresponsiveness by thymocyte transfer.;Prolonged survival of vascularized organ allografts has been produced in unmodified inbred rats by transfer of thymocytes from enhanced, engrafted, syngeneic animals. For these thymocytes to increase significantly the survival of test allografts they must be harvested 6-9 d after transplantation. Thymectomy of the enhanced, engrafted animals during the same critical period causes acute rejection of othewise long surviving grafts. For optimal effect, the enhanced thymocyte donor must be actively and passively immunized and receive a cardiac allograft. The necessity for erythrocytes in the initial active immunization regimen is noted. Additionally, the antigenic specificity of the suppressor effect has been established with two histoincompatible donor rat strains. Cellular and humoral host responses mounted by test graft recipients after thymocyte transfer from enhanced, engrafted donors are different from those mounted either by unmodifed animals acutely rejecting their grafts or by enhanced rats bearing well-functioning grafts. Numbers of T lymphocytes are reduced in the grafted hearts and in the spleens of test graft recipients, a finding paralleled by the complete absence of specific direct lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity. In contrast, cytotoxic antibody production, although delayed, is increased in magnitude, peaking around the time of graft rejection. These studies provide evidence that different biological manipulations can modify separate pathways in the complex cellular and humoral responses towards organ allografts. They demonstrate that cellular immunity is critically involved in immunological enhancement of vascularized organ allografts, a phenomenon hitherto considered primarily humoral. It seems clear that cells with suppressor activity are present within the thymus during the early phases of immunological enhancement.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
338;37;Poly(8-aminoguanylic acid): formation of ordered self-structures and interaction with poly(cytidylic acid).;"Poly(8-aminoguanylic acid) has in neutral solution a novel ordered structure of high stability. The 8-amino group permits formation of three hydrogen bonds between two residues along the ""top"", or long axis, of the purines. The usual hydrogen bonding protons and Watson-Crick pairing sites are not involved in the association. The bonding scheme has a twofold rotation axis and is hemiprotonated at N(7). Poly(8NH2G) is converted by alkaline titration (pK = 9.7) to a quite different ordered structure, which is the favored form over the range approximately pH 10-11. The bonding scheme appears to be composed of a planar, tetrameric array of guanine residues, in which the 8-amino group does not participate in interbase hydrogen bonding. Poly (8NH2G) does not interact with poly(C) in neutral solution because of the high stability of the hemiprotonated G-G self-structure. Titration to the alkaline plateau, however, permits ready formation of a two-stranded Watson-Crick helix. In contrast to the monomer 8NH2GMP, poly(8NH2G) does not form a triple helix with poly(C) under any conditions. The properties of the ordered structures are interpreted in terms of a strong tendency of the 8-amino group to form a third interbase hydrogen bond, when this possibility is not prevented by high pH.";polycysteine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
344;6193181;Analyses of the serum concentrations and antigenic determinants of thyroglobulin in chickens susceptible to autoimmune thyroiditis.;These studies revealed an abnormal elevation in serum thyroglobulin (Tg) concentrations of the thyroiditis-prone OS chicks. Their serum levels, measured by a sensitive and specific RIA, remained high for the first 2 wk of age, a time preceding significant lymphoid infiltration of their thyroid glands. The elevated serum Tg levels probably resulted from, or were related to, hyperactivity of the OS thyroid gland. Reducing the activity of the OS thyroid gland by exogenous administration of T4 caused a temporary but significant reduction in thyroidal infiltration and the synthesis of Tg antibodies. In addition to the analysis of serum concentrations of Tg, a competitive binding RIA was developed to determine whether unique antigenic determinants exist on Tg isolated from OS thyroid glands. This was proved to be unlikely because OS chicks produced autoantibodies that fully cross-reacted with Tg isolated from normal chicken thyroid glands. The relationships between intrinsic thyroid hyperactivity, high serum Tg levels, the sensitization of OS thymocytes, and thyroiditis are discussed.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
347;6087546;Murine retrovirus Pr65gag forms a 130K dimer in the absence of disulfide reducing agents.;"Gazdar-murine sarcoma virus (Gz-MSV) particles, obtained from tissue culture fluids of chronically infected HTG-2 hamster cells are immature in morphology and contain uncleaved Pr65gag as the predominant protein (greater than 95% Coomassie blue stain) (A. Pinter and E. deHarven, 1979, Virology 99, 103-110; Y. Yoshinaka and R. B. Luftig, 1982, Virology 118, 380-388). When Gz-MSV particles are disrupted in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in the absence of reducing agents, such as beta-mercaptoethanol (beta-MSH) almost half of the Pr65gag Coomassie blue-stained band is detected as a band at a Mr of 130K. Electrophoretic blotting studies with monospecific antisera against MuLV p30, p15, p12, and p10 showed that the 130K band cross-reacted with all four antigens suggesting that it was a dimer of Pr65gag. Two-dimensional (2D) SDS-PAGE where the first dimension was run under nonreducing conditions and the second with beta-MSH, supported the contention that the 130K band was a dimeric complex of Pr65gag. One also saw minor amounts of a 260K and higher polymeric forms of Pr65gag on the SDS gels, suggesting that polymeric forms may exist as well. When 32P-labeled Gz-MSV particles obtained by in vivo labeling of infected HTG-2 cells with [32P]PPi were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE, only 10% of the 32P label was detected at the 130K position. In contrast, 30% of the Coomassie blue-stained Pr65gag material was found at 130K on the 2D gels. This suggests that unphosphorylated Pr65gag is more likely to participate in dimer formation than phosphorylated Pr65gag. Pr65gag of Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV), which is present as a minor (5% of stain) protein band on SDS-PAGE also showed 130K dimers. Further, in beta-MSH-deficient SDS preparations of Gz-MSV, electrophoresed after trypsin treatment, a 32K band that stained with p15, but not p10, p12, nor p30, antisera was observed. If beta-MSH was added, this band was no longer present. Thus Pr65gag dimerization in immature MuLV particles appears to at least involve the p15 region of the polyprotein. Since p15 is an extremely hydrophobic protein, formation of Pr65gag dimers may occur when virion precursor proteins are brought to the cell membrane during virus assembly.";-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3

In this study, two internal standards are used as size markers to bracket und precisely size PCR products. The technique is applied to typing PCR products from the short tandem repeat locus HUMTH01. HUMTH01 consists of five to seven major alleles in the size range of 179-203 bp, with each allele four bp apart. Using this genetic marker, a population containing 97 individuals was examined with both polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and CE. Identical genotypes were obtained with both techniques demonstrating the reliability of CE in DNA typing applications. The DNA analysis took place in sets of 10 with a calibration of the CE being performed between each set of samples. For the 97 samples examined, the pooled standard deviation was 0.3 bp. The observed genotype frequencies determined from the sample set did not deviate significantly from Hardy-Weinberg expectations. From these CE results, we conclude that HUMTH01 PCR products can be accurately and precisely sized by capillary electrophoresis using the method described.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1

353;1730754;Characterization of the major hnRNP proteins from Drosophila melanogaster.;To better understand the role(s) of hnRNP proteins in the process of mRNA formation, we have identified and characterized the major nuclear proteins that interact with hnRNAs in Drosophila melanogaster. cDNA clones of several D. melanogaster hnRNP proteins have been isolated and sequenced, and the genes encoding these proteins have been mapped cytologically on polytene chromosomes. These include the hnRNP proteins hrp36, hrp40, and hrp48, which together account for the major proteins of hnRNP complexes in D. melanogaster (Matunis et al., 1992, accompanying paper). All of the proteins described here contain two amino-terminal RNP consensus sequence RNA-binding domains and a carboxyl-terminal glycine-rich domain. We refer to this configuration, which is also found in the hnRNP A/B proteins of vertebrates, as 2 x RBD-Gly. The sequences of the D. melanogaster hnRNP proteins help define both highly conserved and variable amino acids within each RBD and support the suggestion that each RBD in multiple RBD-containing proteins has been conserved independently and has a different function. Although 2 x RBD-Gly proteins from evolutionarily distant organisms are conserved in their general structure, we find a surprising diversity among the members of this family of proteins. A mAb to the hrp40 proteins crossreacts with the human A/B and G hnRNP proteins and detects immunologically related proteins in divergent organisms from yeast to man. These data establish 2 x RBD-Gly as a prevalent hnRNP protein structure across eukaryotes. This information about the composition of hnRNP complexes and about the structure of hnRNA-binding proteins will facilitate studies of the functions of these proteins.; polyglycine ;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Because the induction is both massive and rapid, this system may be useful for a detailed dissection of peroxisomal biogenesis. We report procedures to express peroxisomal proteins in cells and spheroplasts of Candida boidinii to stabilize peroxisomes in a lysate of spheroplasts and to obtain an enriched peroxisomal fraction. With these techniques we have been able to study the assembly of alcohol oxidase, a homo-octomeric flavoprotein, into the organelle in vivo. The primary translation product of alcohol oxidase comigrates on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels with the mature subunit. Pulse-chase experiments indicate that the newly synthesized monomer of alcohol oxidase has a half-life of about 20 min in intact cells and 13 min in spheroplasts before conversion to octomer. The monomer first appears in a high speed supernatant of a lysate of spheroplasts and then chases into a purified peroxisomal fraction before or during its octomerization.

A proteomic approach was employed to identify proteins that are upregulated by infection with P. cinnamomi. Different proteins were shown to be differentially expressed after challenge with the pathogen by two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis. A densitometric evaluation of protein expression indicated differential regulation during the time-course analyzed. Some proteins induced in response to the infection were identified by standard peptide mass fingerprinting using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry and sequencing by MALDI LIFT-TOF/TOF tandem mass spectrometry. Of the 400 protein spots detected on 2-D gels, 21 seemed to change in abundance by 3 hours after infection. Sixteen proteins were upregulated, 5 of these were only detected in infected roots and 11 showed an increased abundance. Among the differentially expressed proteins identified are homologs to isoflavone reductase, glutathione S-transferase, several abscisic acid stress-ripening proteins, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase, cysteine synthase and quinone reductase. A 17.3-kDa small heat-shock protein and a glycine-rich RNA-binding protein were identified as downregulated.

363;8230224;Atomic structure of a cytochrome c' with an unusual ligand-controlled dimer dissociation at 1.8 A resolution.;The crystallographic structure of cytochrome c' from the purple phototrophic bacterium Chromatium vinosum (CVCP) has been determined at 1.8 A resolution using multiple isomorphous replacement. The molecule is a dimer, with each 131-residue chain folding as a four-helical bundle incorporating a covalently bound heme group at the core. This structure is the third of the ubiquitous cytochromes c' to be solved and is similar to the known structures of cytochrome c' from R. molischianum (RMCP) and R. rubrum (RRCP). CVCP is unique in exhibiting ligand-controlled dimer dissociation while RMCP and RRCP do not. The Tyr16 side-chain, which replaced Met16 in RMCP and Leu14 in RRCP, is parallel to the heme plane and located directly above the sixth ligand site of the heme Fe. Any ligand binding to this site, such as CO or CN-, must move the Tyr16 side-chain, which would be expected to cause other conformational changes of helix A, which contributes to the dimer interface, and consequently disrupting the dimer. Thus, the crystallographic structure of CVCP suggests a mechanism for dimer dissociation upon ligand binding.

368;29870692;Carbon nanotube-based aptasensor for sensitive electrochemical detection of whole-cell Salmonella.;In this study, an amino-modified aptasensor using multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)-deposited ITO electrode was prepared and evaluated for the detection of pathogenic Salmonella bacteria. An amino-modified aptamer (ssDNA) which binds selectively to whole-cell Salmonella was immobilised on the COOH-rich MWCNTs to produce the ssDNA/MWCNT/ITO electrode. The morphology of the MWCNT before and after interaction with the aptamers were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques were used to investigate the electrochemical properties and conductivity of the aptasensor. The results showed that the impedance measured at the ssDNA/MWCNT/ITO electrode surface increased after exposure to Salmonella cells, which indicated successful binding of Salmonella on the aptamer-functionalised surface. The developed ssDNA/MWCNT/ITO aptasensor was stable and maintained linearity when the scan rate was increased from 10 mV s-1 to 90 mV s-1. The detection limit of the ssDNA/MWCNT/ITO aptasensor, determined from the sensitivity analysis, was found to be 5.5 × 101 cfu mL-1 and 6.7 × 101 cfu mL-1 for S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium, respectively. The specificity test demonstrated that Salmonella bound specifically to the ssDNA/MWCNT/ITO aptasensor surface, when compared with non-Salmonella spp. The prepared aptasensor was successfully applied for the detection of Salmonella in food samples.;polyhistidine;-;-;LCR_without_function

374;29399392;Pro-inflammatory allogeneic DCs promote activation of bystander immune cells and thereby license antigen-specific T-cell responses.;Accumulating evidence support an important role for endogenous bystander dendritic cells (DCs) in the efficiency of autologous patient-derived DC-vaccines, as bystander DCs take up material from vaccine-DCs, migrate to draining lymph node and initiate antitumor T-cell responses. We examined the possibility of using allogeneic DCs as vaccine-DCs to activate bystander immune cells and promote antigen-specific T-cell responses. We demonstrate that human DCs matured with polyI:C, R848 and IFN-γ (denoted COMBIG) in combination with an infection-enhanced adenovirus vector (denoted Ad5M) exhibit a pro-inflammatory state. COMBIG/Ad5M-matured allogeneic DCs (alloDCs) efficiently activated T-cells and NK-cells in allogeneic co-culture experiments. The secretion of immunostimulatory factors during the co-culture promoted the maturation of bystander-DCs, which efficiently cross-presented a model-antigen to activate antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells in vitro. We propose that alloDCs, in combination with Ad5M as loading vehicle, may be a cost-effective and logistically simplified DC vaccination strategy to induce anti-tumor immune responses in cancer patients. ;polyisoleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
377;8752101;Cultured leptomeningeal cells secrete cerebrospinal fluid proteins.;To extrapolate the function of the leptomeninges, we examined the profile of the proteins secreted from the cultured leptomeningeal cells prepared from 1-2-day-old rats. In sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the medium conditioned with the cultured cells, 20-25 differentially distinctive protein bands were noted. Through several chromatographic procedures (Sephadex G-75, Mono Q, and 7C8-300), altogether 18 proteins were purified to homogeneity, and the partial amino acid sequence of each protein was determined. Homology search revealed that the major proteins included prostaglandin-D-synthase or beta-trace protein, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-II, IGF-binding protein-2, apolipoprotein E, beta 2-microglobulin, cystatin C, transferrin, peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase or cyclophilin C, secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine, ubiquitin, lysozyme C, extracellular superoxide dismutase, and collagen alpha-1 (III). Most of these proteins are known to be the major brain-derived protein constituents of CSF and are thought to play important roles in certain biological events in the brain. Considering the morphological features, the present findings suggest the importance of the leptomeninges as an origin of such proteins in CSF.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
380;24495073;Kinase activity and calmodulin binding are essential for growth signaling by the phytosulfokine receptor PSKR1.;The cell growth-promoting peptide phytosulfokine (PSK) is perceived by leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinases. To elucidate PSK receptor function we analyzed PSKR1 kinase activity and binding to Ca(2+) sensors and evaluated the contribution of these activities to growth control in planta. Ectopically expressed PSKR1 was capable of auto- and transphosphorylation. Replacement of a conserved lysine within the ATP-binding region by a glutamate resulted in the inhibition of auto- and transphosphorylation kinase activities. Expression of the kinase-inactive PSKR1(K762E) receptor in the pskr null background did not restore root or shoot growth. Instead, the mutant phenotype was enhanced suggesting that the inactive receptor protein exerts growth-inhibitory activity. Bioinformatic analysis predicted a putative calmodulin (CaM)-binding site within PSKR1 kinase subdomain VIa. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis demonstrated that PSKR1 binds to all isoforms of CaM, more weakly to the CaM-like protein CML8 but apparently not to CML9. Mutation of a conserved tryptophan (W831S) within the predicted CaM-binding site strongly reduced CaM binding. Expression of PSKR1(W831S) in the pskr null background resulted in growth inhibition that was similar to that of the kinase-inactive receptor. We conclude that PSK signaling requires Ca(2+) /CaM binding and kinase activity of PSKR1 in planta. We further propose that the inactivated kinase interferes with other growth-promoting signaling pathway(s).  ;polyleucine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
381;6979359;Nonspecific esterase of B lymphocytes from a case of chronic lymhocytic leukemia and of normal T lymphocytes: similar constellations of isoenzymes.;Lymphocytes from a case of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were obtained in a highly purified state from a therapeutic leukapheresis preparation. The CLL lymphocytes showed a fine, scattered, granular pattern of nonspecific esterase cytochemical reactivity with either alpha-naphthyl acetate (alpha NA) or alpha-naphthyl butyrate (alpha NB) substrate as opposed to the more focal pattern of control (T) lymphocytes. Nonspecific esterase of CLL lymphocytes and normal control lymphocytes was equally resistant to inhibition by fluoride ion. Extractable nonspecific esterases from the CLL lymphocytes and from purified normal T lymphocytes were indistinguishable in regard to specific activity, substrate specificity, pH optima, and zymogram profiles on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 9.5 and pH 4.0. Zymograms of alpha NA esterase and alpha NB esterase prepared by isoelectric focusing were also similar, with no unequivocal differences. These results are consistent with recent reports that B lymphocytes contain detectable nonspecific esterase and suggest that the B lymphocytes from this case of CLL contained a constellation of isoenzymes similar to that of normal T lymphocytes. This is interpreted as a reflection of the close kinship of these cells.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
382;8995252;The related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase is tyrosine-phosphorylated after beta1-integrin stimulation in B cells and binds to p130cas.;Integrin ligation initiates intracellular signaling events, among which are the activation of protein tyrosine kinases. The related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase (RAFTK), also known as PYK2 and CAKbeta, is a tyrosine kinase that is homologous to the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) p125FAK. The structure of RAFTK is similar to p125FAK in that it lacks a transmembrane region, does not contain Src homology 2 or 3 domains, and has a proline-rich region in its C terminus. Here we report that RAFTK is a target for beta1-integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation in both transformed and normal human B cells. Ligation of the B cell antigen receptor also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK. Phosphorylation of RAFTK following integrin- or B cell antigen receptor-mediated stimulation was decreased by prior treatment of cells with cytochalasin B, indicating that this process was at least partially cytoskeleton-dependent. One of the tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates after integrin stimulation in fibroblasts is p130cas, which can associate with p125FAK. RAFTK also interacted constitutively with p130cas in B cells, since p130cas was detected in RAFTK immunoprecipitates. Although the function of RAFTK remains unknown, these data suggest that RAFTK may have a significant function in integrin-mediated signaling pathways in B cells. ;polyproline;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
384;1629666;Presence of a trypsin-like protease in starfish sperm acrosome.;Marthasterias glacialis sperm cells were treated with ionophore A23187, centrifuged, and the supernatants were assayed for esterase activity. With N-benzoyl-L-arginine ethyl ester-HCl (BAEE) as substrate, a net activity was determined which was not detectable when N-acetyl-L-tyrosine ethyl ester (ATEE) was used. The BAEE trypsin-like activity was inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI), N-alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone-HCl (TLCK), and phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), but not by L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK). The presence of proteolytic activity in acrosomal exudates was further demonstrated by gelatin-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic zymography (gelatin-SDS-PAGE). The presence of several bands of low proteolytic activity and of one band of high proteolytic activity, which also has the lower molecular weight, together with the fact that all are inhibited by benzamidine, suggests the existence of a trypsin-like proteinase system. The effect of the acrosomal exudate on the oocyte jelly coat was investigated by SDS-PAGE analysis. All jelly proteins appeared to be digested by the acrosomal enzymes. Furthermore, if SBTI is added shortly after insemination, the sperm fail to fertilize the oocytes. These results indicate that the starfish sperm acrosomal vesicle contains a trypsin-like protease which may be involved in sperm penetration through the oocyte jelly coat.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
389;6277791;Antibody responses in humans to individual proteins of herpes simplex viruses.;Sera from 231 women were used to examine their frequency of precipitation of various herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) proteins and to determine if there was a rank order of immune responsiveness of humans to these HSV antigens. Radiolabeled viral proteins were reacted with serum and immune complexes isolated with staphylococcal protein A. Individual antigens were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by fluorography. As a group, these sera precipitated 31 HSV-1 and 27 HSV-2 proteins. HSV-1 polypeptides with molecular weights of 133,000, 99,000, and 82,000, as well as HSV-2 polypeptides with molecular weights of 131,000 and 101,000, were precipitated by essentially all sera that contained antibodies to HSV-1 and HSV-2. When attempts were made to order the viral proteins by constructing precipitation profiles ranking the antigens in patterns according to their frequency of precipitation, it was observed that the antigens were generally not ordered. Demographic analysis of the sera suggested that the differences in the number of proteins precipitated were associated with differences in age, education, age at first marriage, and income, which collectively may reflect the frequency of exposure to the virus.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
394;7299032;Cognitive development and female psychology.;"Freud was an astute observer, but his understanding of female psychology was distorted by centration on biological forces, the adult neurosis, libido theory, the Oedipus complex, and male psychology. His views on the role of penis envy, narcissism, and masochism in women, and on the female superego, currently are being updated on the basis of new data emerging out of psychoanalytic investigation and direct observational studies. It has become clear, for example, that core feminine gender identity develops very early and that it is mediated in large part by cognitive development and learning rather than by the impact of the observation of genital differences between the sexes. The little girl's level of cognitive organization does not permit her at first to construct logical, consistent categories of female and male, predicated or coordination of criteria of inclusion and exclusion. She puts girls and women into one group out of intuitive recognition that they ""go together"" and builds up a view of herself as female on the basis of what she feels as her mother's daughter and what she perceives of the way her parents and other significant object see her. Her mother's feelings about her, about herself, and about females in general influence her greatly, and her father's responses to and expectations of her have an important impact on her self-image and self-esteem. Her representation of herself as female at first does not necessarily take genital differences between the sexes into account. The discovery, some time in the second or third year, that the genitals of boys and girls are different from one another presents the girl with a number of problems, however. Her cognitive organization makes it extremely difficult for her to apprehend her complex, incompletely demarcated, and to a large extent internal, unobservable, and impalpable sexual organs. Her initial conclusion is that she lacks desirable body parts which are possessed by other beings. Because of the narcissistic-exhibitionistic libidinal organization of that period of life, this represents a painful narcissistic injury. The intensity of the girl's castration reaction and the degree to which she will be able to overcome it in the course of further development are determined by multiple internal and external developmental factors. Masochism, narcissistic vulnerability, and penis envy are neither limited to the female sex nor normal outcomes of female development. Where they are prominent features in the psychopathology of female patients, it is insufficient to interpret them as emanating from penis envy as a bedrock, primal cause. Detailed clinical examples are presented to illustrate the thesis that through exploration and explication of the multiple sources of such symptomatology in a female analysand is the most effective way of relieving the symptomatology and releasing the potential for emotional growth.";-;-;-;hard_0
396;9747033;Identification of amplified DNA sequences on double minute chromosomes in a leukemic cell line KY821 by means of spectral karyotyping and comparative genomic hybridization.;Double minute chromosomes (dmin) are cytogenetic hallmarks of amplified genes.

The SKY revealed that the DNA sequences of dmin are derived from materials of chromosome 8, and CGH showed a high degree of overrepresentation only at 8q22-24, indicating that in KY821 only chromosomal material of 8q22-24, containing MYC, is amplified in dmin. An approach combining SKY with CGH should facilitate efforts to identify novel chromosomal regions of gene amplification and contribute information about genetic lesions that underly neoplastic tumors.;-;-;-;hard_0
402;886647;Reovirus-specific enzyme(s) associated with subviral particles responds in vitro to polyribocytidylate to yield double-stranded polyribocytidylate-polyriboguanylate.;In reovirus-infected cells, virus-specific particles accumulate that have associated with them a polyribocytidylate [poly(C)]-dependent polymerase. This enzyme copies in vitro poly(C) to yield the double-stranded poly(C).polyriboguanylate [poly(G)]. The particles with poly(C)-dependent polymerase were heterogeneous in size, with most sedimenting from 300S to 550S. Exponential increase in these particles began at 23 h, and maximal amounts were present by 31 h, the time of onset of exponential growth of virus at 30 degrees C. Maximal amounts of particles with active transcriptase and replicase were present at 15 and 18 h after infection. Thereafter, there was a marked decrease in particles with active transcriptase and replicase until base line levels were reached at 31 h. Thus, the increase in poly(C)-responding particles occurred coincident with the decrease in particles with active transcriptase and replicase. The requirement for poly(C) as template was specific because no RNA was synthesized in vitro in response to any other homopolymer, including 2'-O-methyl-poly(C). Synthesis was optimal in the presence of Mn(2+) as the divalent cation, and no primer was necessary for synthesis. In contrast, the dinucleotide GpG markedly stimulated synthesis in the presence of 8 mM Mg(2+). The size of the poly(C).poly(G) synthesized in vitro was dependent on the size of the poly(C) used as template. This suggested that the whole template was copied into a complementary strand of similar size. The T(m) of the product was between 100 and 130 degrees C. Hydrolysis of the product labeled in [(32)P]GMP with alkali or RNase T2 yielded GMP as the only labeled mononucleotide. This does indicate that the synthesis of the poly(G) strand in vitro did not proceed by end addition to the poly(C) template, but proceeded on a separate strand.;polycysteine;-;-;LCR_without_function
404;10577804;Cerebral auditory plasticity and cochlear implants.;Previous animal research and clinical experiences in humans suggest the existence of an auditory critical period in language acquisition. We review the literature and present the changes within the cochlear nuclei in bilaterally deafferentated adult non-human primates. We also present and analyse the results of 98 prelingually deaf children and teenagers who underwent a cochlear implantation at the University of Navarra. Patients received a Nucleus 22 or 24 multichannel cochlear implant (CI). They were grouped in five categories according to their age at surgery. Performance is compared with a control group of 58 postlinguals. Only early-implanted prelingual children (before 6 years of age) achieved a complete open-set speech recognition, even with better performance than postlinguals. These results clearly demonstrate the existence of a period of high neural auditory plasticity within the first 6 years of life. The introduction of auditory stimulation with a CI can not restore the loss of neural plasticity out of this period. Prelingual children under 6 years of age should receive a CI as soon as there is a reliable diagnosis of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss.;-;-;-;hard_0
410;26709694;Controlled Osteogenic Differentiation of Mouse Mesenchymal Stem Cells by Tetracycline-Controlled Transcriptional Activation of Amelogenin.;"Regenerative dental therapies for bone tissues rely on efficient targeting of endogenous and transplanted mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to guide bone formation. Amelogenin is the primary component of Emdogain, which is used to regenerate periodontal defects; however, the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects on alveolar bone remain unclear. The tetracycline (Tet)-dependent transcriptional regulatory system is a good candidate to investigate distinct roles of genes of interest during stem cell differentiation. Here, we investigated amelogenin-dependent regulation of osteogenesis in MSCs by establishing a Tet-controlled transcriptional activation system. Clonal mouse bone marrow-derived MSCs were lentivirally transduced with the Tet repressor (TetR) expression vector followed by drug selection to obtain MSCs constitutively expressing TetR (MSCs-TetR). Expression vectors that contained the Tet operator and amelogenin-coding (Amelx) cDNA fragments were constructed using the Gateway system and lentivirally introduced into MSCs-TetR to generate a Tet regulation system in MSCs (MSCs-TetR/Amelx). MSCs-TetR/Amelx significantly overexpressed the Amelx gene and protein in the presence of the tetracycline derivative doxycycline. Concomitant expression of osterix, bone sialoprotein (BSP), osteopontin, and osteocalcin was modulated by addition or removal of doxycycline under osteogenic guidance. During osteogenic induction, MSCs-TetR/Amelx treated with doxycycline showed significantly increased gene expression of osterix, type I collagen, BSP, and osteocalcin in addition to increased alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralized nodule formation. Enhanced extracellular matrix calcification was observed when forced Amelx expression commenced at the early stage but not at the intermediate or late stages of osteogenesis. These results suggest that a Tet-controlled Amelx gene regulation system for mouse MSCs was successfully established, in which transcriptional activation of Amelx was associated with enhanced osteogenic differentiation, especially in the early stage of biomineralization.";-;phosphatase activity;-;hard_2

416;8218349;Lipoxygenase in soybean seedlings catalyzes the oxygenation of phospholipid and such activity changes after treatment with fungal elicitor.;Lipoxygenase (LOX) activities in the crude extracts of soybean cotyledons on phospholipid were measured by a chemiluminescence (CL) assay system. The activity of LOX on phospholipid increased at 6 h after treatment with fungal elicitor, whereas the activity in the control experiment without elicitor treatment declined with incubation. A rise of LOX activity at 6 h incubation is considered to be induced by the elicitor treatment. The LOX fraction obtained from soybean cotyledons at 6 h after elicitation by a DEAE column chromatography was reacted with 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-phosphatidylcholine substrate. The reaction product was analyzed by HPLC equipped in series with a UV (205 nm) and a CL detector. Most of the substrate was converted to a hydroperoxy compound. By the CL-HPLC analysis after transesterification of reaction product and by mass spectrum of the trimethylsilyl derivative after reduction of methyl ester confirmed that the linoleic moiety was subjected to oxygenation at 13-position. The steric analysis of menthoxyacetyl derivative prepared from hydroxy fatty acid methyl ester showed S configuration.

429;24084383;Myocardin-related transcription factor A is up-regulated by 17β-estradiol and promotes migration of MCF-7 breast cancer cells via transactivation of MYL9 and CYR61.;Many lines of evidence have suggested that estrogen plays important roles not only in the initiation and proliferation of breast cancer, but also in cancer metastasis. However, the mechanistic basis of the latter events is poorly understood. In addition, recent studies have suggested that myocardin-related transcription factor A (MRTF-A) might be related to cancer metastasis. However, as reports are contradictory, certain of its roles still remain confusing. In the present study, we showed that excessive 17β-estradiol could promote the migration of MCF-7 breast cancer cells and up-regulate the expression of MRTF-A, myosin regulatory light chain 9 (MYL9), and cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (CYR61). Overexpression of MRTF-A significantly promoted the migration of MCF-7 cells through its transactivation effects on MYL9 and CYR61 genes, while RNA interference-mediated knockdown of MRTF-A strongly inhibited transcription and expression of the target genes and reduced the migration ability of MCF-7 cells. These results provided novel evidence supporting the metastasis-promoting functions of MRTF-A, and implied that MRTF-A might be a switch for the estrogen pathway to change its proliferation-promoting roles into migration-stimulating roles in breast cancer.  ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

431;1713251;Intracellular localization of tyrosine kinase substrates beneath crosslinked surface immunoglobulins in B cells.;Crosslinking of surface immunoglobulins (sIg) in B cells led to the accumulation of submembranal phosphotyrosine, which was followed morphologically with the PY20 antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody. Phosphotyrosine was not detected before sIg crosslinking. After sIg crosslinking, phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were redistributed from scattered small clusters near the plasma membrane to a juxtanuclear region, where immunofluorescent staining decreased with time. Double immunofluorescent staining of individual cells showed accumulation of phosphotyrosine beneath crosslinked sIg molecules at the cell surface. The sIg molecules were subsequently internalized more rapidly than the phosphotyrosine-containing molecules were redistributed. Genistein, a protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitor, blocked intracellular tyrosine phosphorylations but not cell surface patching of crosslinked sIg. When polyacrylamide beads coated with anti-Ig antibodies were added to the cells, intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation occurred beneath the regions of contact with the beads. This study provides an independent line of evidence confirming recent biochemical experiments that show that crosslinking of the antigen receptor induces PTK activity in B cells, and that components of the newly described sIg complex are among the PTK substrates. The surprising finding that the bulk of the induced phosphotyrosine remains associated with crosslinked sIg for many minutes suggests a role for complex local protein interactions in phosphotyrosine-mediated signal transduction through the antigen receptor of B cells.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
434;2648403;Subtelomeric chromosome deletions in field isolates of Plasmodium falciparum and their relationship to loss of cytoadherence in vitro.;"Subtelomeric deletions are responsible for the loss of expression of several Plasmodium falciparum antigens, including the knob-associated histidine-rich protein (KAHRP). Such deletions are detectable by two-dimensional pulsed-field gradient electrophoresis (PFGE) in which the chromosomes separated in dimension 1 are cleaved with Apa I, and the sizes of telomeric fragments are determined in dimension 2. This sensitive technique has enabled us to examine the role of subtelomeric deletions in two aspects of the biology of Plasmodium falciparum. First, we show that similar subtelomeric deletions to those that occur in vitro also occur in field isolates. Second, we demonstrate a correlation between subtelomeric deletions and loss of the phenotype of ""cytoadherence"" in cultured isolates. Subclones were generated from the cytoadherent cloned isolate ItG2F6, and their phenotypes were examined with respect to cytoadherence, the expression of ""knobs,"" and agglutination of infected erythrocytes with rabbit antiserum. The only chromosomal change detectable by two-dimensional PFGE among subclones that differ from wild type in each of these three characteristics is a deletion of approximately 100 kilobases at one end of chromosome 2.

437;25024404;The adipogenic transcriptional cofactor ZNF638 interacts with splicing regulators and influences alternative splicing.;"Increasing evidence indicates that transcription and alternative splicing are coordinated processes; however, our knowledge of specific factors implicated in both functions during the process of adipocyte differentiation is limited. We have previously demonstrated that the zinc finger protein ZNF638 plays a role as a transcriptional coregulator of adipocyte differentiation via induction of PPAR? in cooperation with CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBPs). Here we provide new evidence that ZNF638 is localized in nuclear bodies enriched with splicing factors, and through biochemical purification of ZNF638's interacting proteins in adipocytes and mass spectrometry analysis, we show that ZNF638 interacts with splicing regulators. Functional analysis of the effects of ectopic ZNF638 expression on a minigene reporter demonstrated that ZNF638 is sufficient to promote alternative splicing, a function enhanced through its recruitment to the minigene promoter at C/EBP responsive elements via C/EBP proteins. Structure-function analysis revealed that the arginine/serine-rich motif and the C-terminal zinc finger domain required for speckle localization are necessary for the adipocyte differentiation function of ZNF638 and for the regulation of the levels of alternatively spliced isoforms of lipin1 and nuclear receptor co-repressor 1. Overall, our data demonstrate that ZNF638 participates in splicing decisions and that it may control adipogenesis through regulation of the relative amounts of differentiation-specific isoforms.

This study compares the efficacy of curettage and desiccation once and three times in removing basal cell tumors. The results suggest that these neoplasms have two distinct growth patterns. One is more invasive and incompletely removed by curettage-desiccation. The second pattern is removed by a single cycle of curettage and desiccation. It is hypothesized, based on a review of pertinent literature, that these growth patterns are related to immunologic interaction with tumor cells.;-;-;-;hard_0
442;9227798;Post treatment sensitivity studies with the ParaSight-F test for malaria diagnosis in Zimbabwe.;The post-treatment diagnostic performance of the Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein (HRP-II) antigen detection test, ParaSight-F test, was assessed on 55 falciparum malaria cases treated with chloroquine during in vivo drug sensitivity studies. The post-treatment sensitivity of the test remained high, except for an insignificant decline on day 1. However, specificity dropped sharply by day 1, subsequently increasing linearly with time to satisfactory values by day 10. As expected, from its inverse relationship to specificity, the false positive rate was high on day 1 and decreased linearly to low level by day 10. The temporary increase in false positive rate-following treatment was due to persistent parasite antigen, rather than subpatent parasitaemia. Thus findings showed that positive readings by the test within 10 days post-treatment may occur in cured cases and will not necessarily imply treatment failure. Furthermore it will be important to take patient antimalarial history into consideration during routine usage of the test for malaria diagnosis. The trend of Youden's J-index for the ParaSight-F test showed that from 10 days post-treatment, the test was generally reliable, with positive readings indicating active infection. It was concluded that the ParaSight-F test was not only valuable at confirming malaria diagnosis on clinical cases in seasonal transmission areas, but had potential for application to detect recrudescent infections within 2 weeks of chloroquine treatment. ;polyhistidine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
445;7285774;Retinal dysplasia.;Retinal dysplasia is defined as an abnormal growth and differentiation of embryonic retina being more a secondary lesion rather than a disease. Clinically, the disorder may present itself in a surprisingly wide range of severity or of degree from retinal folds to vascularized masses in the vitreous cavity. The condition may appear monosymptomatically, involving only the eye, or as complex disorders with multisystemic anomalies. The histopathologic findings in this disorder recognize characteristic structural deviations of the retina and the pathogenesis seems to be related to the lack of the normal histogenesis of the pigment epithelium. Impaired genetic mechanisms seem to contribute to the etiology of some forms of retinal dysplasia.;-;-;-;hard_0
447;6088963;Hepatitis A-virus in cell culture. V. Neutralizing antibodies against hepatitis A-virus.;A test system for the detection of neutralizing antibodies against hepatitis A-virus (anti-HAV-Nt) is presented. The anti-HAV-Nt assay is performed with Frhk-4/R cells and the hepatitis A virus (HAV) strain GBM/Frhk-4/R which has been adapted to these cells. Non-neutralized HAV is demonstrated 14 days after infection of Frhk-4/R cells using a radio-immunoassay for detecting newly grown HAV. The influence of differing amounts of HAV on the anti-HAV-Nt titre and the effect of variations in incubation time of virus-serum mixtures are described. The time course of anti-HAV-Nt is shown in sera from a hepatitis-A patient which were taken at different stages of the disease. Anti-HAV-Nt is compared with anti-HAV and anti-HAV-IgM. It is shown that anti-HAV-Nt correlates closely with anti-HAV and separated anti-HAV-IgG, but only slightly with anti-HAV-IgM. The test system presented makes possible the demonstration of neutralizing antibodies against HAV in gamma-globulin preparations and during vaccination studies.;-;-;-;hard_0
449;1710861;Effect of PUVA radiation on anaphylactic histamine release from rat dermal tissues.;We have devised a new in vitro model of type I cutaneous anaphylaxis. Male albino rats were sensitized with DNP-Ascaris. Abdominal skin was shaved, and thin, split-thickness slices of skin were cut with a dermatome. The dermis was excised and cut into 100 mg pieces. The dermal tissue was incubated with antigen in Tyrode's solution for 30 min at 37 degrees C. Antigen-induced histamine release from dermal tissue was measured fluorimetrically. Using this system, we measured histamine release from PUVA-irradiated and non-irradiated dermal tissues. A single PUVA irradiation inhibited type I cutaneous anaphylaxis, but did not affect spontaneous histamine release or total dermal histamine. Our model is considered to be useful for investigation of the mechanism of suppression of type I cutaneous anaphylaxis by PUVA.;-;antigen;-;hard_2

Electrophoresis of the soluble fraction in polyacrylamide gels with sodium dodecyl sulfate and silver staining revealed the presence of 41 bands. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of sera from rabbits immunized with either fraction and from a calf 40 days after infection showed that the animals produced specific antibodies. Enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot tests revealed the presence of five antigens with the rabbit sera and nine with the calf serum. ELISA proved to be an appropriate test for diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis.

456;15106941;Scleral structure, organisation and disease. A review.;Although disease of the sclera is unusual, when it occurs it can rapidly destroy both the eye and vision. However, normally the sclera provides an opaque protective coat for the intraocular tissues and a stable support during variations in internal pressure and eye movements, which would otherwise perturb the visual process through distortion of the retina and the lens/iris diaphragm. This stability, which is vital for clear vision is made possible by the organisation and viscoelastic properties of scleral connective tissue. Microscopically, the sclera displays distinct concentric layers including, from outside, Tenon's capsule, episclera, the scleral stroma proper and lamina fusca, melding into underlying choroid. Two sites exhibit specialised structure and function: the perilimbal trabecular meshwork, through which aqueous filters into Schlemm's canal, and the lamina cribrosa, which permits axons of the optic nerve to exit the posterior sclera. Throughout, sclera is densely collagenous, the stroma consisting of fibrils with various diameters combining into either interlacing fibre bundles or defined lamellae in outer zones. Scleral fibrils are heterotypic structures made of collagen types I and III, with small amounts of types V and VI also present. Scleral elastic fibres are especially abundant in lamina fusca and trabecular meshwork. The interfibrillar matrix is occupied by small leucine-rich proteoglycans, decorin and biglycan, containing dermatan and dermatan/chondroitin sulphate glycosaminoglycans, together with the large proteoglycan, aggrecan, which also carries keratan sulphate sidechains. Decorin is closely associated with the collagen fibrils at specific binding sites situated close to the C-terminus of the collagen molecules. Proteoglycans influence hydration, solute diffusion and fluid movement through the sclera, both from the uvea and via the trabecular meshwork. As the sclera is avascular, nutrients come from the choroid and vascular plexi in Tenon's capsule and episclera, where there is an artery to artery anastomosis in which blood oscillates, rather than flows rapidly. This predisposes to the development of vasculitis causing a spectrum of inflammatory conditions of varying intensity which, in the most severe form, necrotising scleritis, may destroy all of the structural and cellular components of the sclera. Scleral cells become fibroblastic and the stroma is infiltrated with inflammatory cells dominated by macrophages and T-lymphocytes. This process resembles, and may be concurrent with, systemic disease affecting other connective tissues, particularly the synovial joints in rheumatoid arthritis. Current views support an autoimmune aetiology for scleritis. Whilst the role of immune complexes and the nature of initial pro-inflammatory antigen(s) remain unknown, the latter may reside in scleral tissue components which are released or modified by viral infection, injury or surgical trauma. ;polyleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

The short prekilling phase of the reaction was accompanied by binding of C3b; loss of viability was immediately preceeded by stable deposition onto the OM of the component proteins of the membrane attack complex. During the early stages of the active killing phase, bound monomeric C9 could be resolved into two distinct bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Serum exposure lead to a progressive loss of CM recoverability, which appeared to result from partial degradation of CM phospholipids. In contrast, exposure of a resistant E, coli strain to human serum resulted in little change in the membrane profile and very little stable deposition of terminal complement components onto the OM.";-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1

The immune response to the A/Vic/75 antigen was also related to a history of recent chemotherapy. There was no correlation between the immune response and the peripheral white blood cell count except at counts less than or equal to 1,000.

After a 1 month placebo run-in period, the patients were treated double-blind either with placebo (n = 25) or with pravastatin (n = 25) for 6 months. Placebo or pravastatin 10 mg during the first month, 20 mg during the second month and 40 mg during the additional 4 months was administered once daily in the evening. Compared with the placebo group the plasma concentration of total cholesterol and phospholipids, free cholesterol and cholesterol esters as well as the plasma LDL-cholesterol and LDL-phospholipids were decreased during 6 months of pravastation therapy. No changes in plasma VLDL-, HDL-, HDL2-, or HDL3-cholesterol, -phospholipids or -triglycerides were observed in the pravastatin-treated patients. A decrease in the plasma level of apolipoprotein B and of LDL-apo B, but not of VLDL-apo B, was observed during pravastatin therapy; the plasma apolipoprotein AI and AII levels as well as HDL2- and HDL3-apo AI and apo AII levels remained, however, unchanged. Plasma lipoprotein Lp(a) did not change during pravastatin therapy whereas the plasma lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase activity (LCAT) increased. In conclusion, treatment of hypercholesterolaemic patients with pravastatin results in a decrease in the plasma concentration of total and free cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, LDL-apo B, phospholipids and cholesterol esters and in an increase in plasma LCAT activity.

Treatment of the high-molecular-weight CA125 antigen with 6M urea yielded a much lower molecular mass peak. After purification by OC125 affinity column chromatography, samples were applied to 3 to 7% polyacrylamide gradient gel and analyzed by Western blot. A single band with a molecular weight (MW) of 200KDa was identified in eutopic EC materials. The CA125 polypeptide of the 110KDa molecule could be detected in all of the CM obtained from heterotopic EC, irrespective of the length of time in the cell culture. A MW of approximately 200 KDa was also observed in some heterotopic EC samples. On the other hand, although the multiple bands with a MW equal to orless than 200KDa were observed in the CM of two ovarian cancer cells, the CA125 polypeptide of 110KDa molecules could not be detected. This preliminary finding offers promise that the 110KDa molecule detection method may be a useful adjunct in the differential diagnosis of heterotopic EC and ovarian cancer.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3

491;9283790;The epidemiology of diabetes in pregnant Native Canadians. A risk profile.;"OBJECTIVE
The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of diabetes in pregnancy (gestational diabetes mellitus [GDM] and NIDDM) and to identify risk factors in the development of GDM in a native population in northwestern Ontario, Canada.


RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
A retrospective analysis of 1,305 singleton deliveries among Ojibwa-Cree women from northwestern Ontario, Canada, was conducted from 1990 to 1993 inclusive. GDM was diagnosed using a 3-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and defined according to standard guidelines.


RESULTS
The overall prevalence of diabetes in pregnancy (NIDDM and GDM) was 11.6% (152 of 1,305) with a GDM prevalence of 8.4% (110 of 1,305). Among 741 women with complete data, prevalence rates increased with age, peaking at 46.9% in the age-group > or = 35 years. Significant risk factors for GDM included older maternal age, multiparity, prepregnancy obesity, a family history of diabetes, and a history of GDM in previous pregnancies.


CONCLUSIONS
Diabetes in pregnancy among Ojibwa-Cree reported here represent the highest rates reported to date in a Canadian population. The high rates of maternal obesity and relative young age of this population further highlight the urgent need for diabetes screening and prevention in this population.";-;-;-;hard_0
493;35169780;Rare Findings in Cleidocranial Dysplasia Caused by RUNX Mutation.;Background  Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD, #MIM119600) is an autosomal-dominant skeletal dysplasia characterized by delayed closure of the cranial sutures, aplasia, or hypoplasia of the clavicles and dental abnormalities. These findings were accompanied by mobile and drooping shoulders, frontal and parietal bossing, hypertelorism, brachycephaly, short stature, supernumerary, and late erupting teeth. Radiographic studies can reveal involvement of multiple bones including skull, chest, pelvis, and limbs. CCD can be diagnosed with clinical and radiological evaluation and validated by molecular studies. Heterozygous loss of function RUNX2 gene, which plays an important role in osteogenesis and differentiation of precursor cells, causes CCD phenotype. Methods  In this article, we reported five cases from three unrelated families with CCD phenotype. All exons and exonic-intronic boundary regions of RUNX2 gene from five patients were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct Sanger-sequencing. Results  Our patients had classical CCD phenotype and we detected three different previously described mutations including c.1171C > T, IVS4 + 4delAAGT and c.676G > A. However, nail dysplasia has never been associated with these mutations. Our patients had varying degrees of nail dysplasia. Two of three mutations are related with Runt DNA-binding domain of RUNX2 protein in Wnt signaling and c.1171C > T had effect on proline/serine/threonine-rich (PST) domain. Recently, Wnt signaling pathway was presented as a key regulator of digit and nail differentiation.

We report on central nervous system metastases from urothelial bladder carcinoma in patients treated with M-VAC chemotherapy.


METHODS
50 patients with advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder were treated with the M-VAC regimen at the Hôpital Cochin (Paris, France) between December 1989 and February 1995. Brain relapses were diagnosed by CT scanning.


RESULTS
We observed a surprising increase in the number of central nervous system relapses (8/50) in patients treated consecutively at the same institution. The mean time to metastatic recurrence in the brain from the initiation of first chemotherapy was 21 months (range 7-38). Six patients had single and 2 patients had multiple central nervous system metastases. Treatment consisted of radiotherapy alone (n = 5) or both surgery and radiotherapy (n = 3). Median survival time from the appearance of cerebral metastases was 3 months (range 1-10).

498;1350281;The p88 molecular chaperone is identical to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein, calnexin.;We previously described a novel molecular chaperone (designated p88) that participates in the assembly of murine class I histocompatibility molecules (Degen, E., and Williams, D. B. (1991) J. Cell Biol. 112, 1099-1115). Our findings suggest that p88 may either promote proper assembly of class I molecules or retain them, probably within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), until assembly of the ternary complex of heavy chain, beta 2-microglobulin, and peptide ligand is complete. In this report, we compare p88 to calnexin, a calcium-binding 90-kDa phosphoprotein of the ER membrane (Wada, I., Rindress, D., Cameron, P. H., Ou, W.-J., Doherty, J.-J., II, Louvard, D., Bell, A.W., Dignard, D., Thomas, D. Y., and Bergeron, J. J. M. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 19599-19610). We show that p88 and calnexin share antigenic epitopes defined by a polyclonal anti-calnexin antiserum. Furthermore, both proteins were immunoprecipitated in association with an intracellularly retained variant of the class I H-2Kb molecule. Since p88 and calnexin were also indistinguishable by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, were resistant to digestion with endoglycosidase H, and exhibited virtually identical patterns of peptide fragments following digestion with either V8 protease or trypsin, we conclude that p88 and calnexin represent the same protein. The identification of the p88 chaperone as a phosphorylated, calcium-binding protein of the ER membrane suggests possible means whereby its interaction with class I molecules may be regulated.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
506;9083889;A novel human monoclonal antibody rapidly induces homotypic cell aggregation and promotes antibody-secreting activity by human B lymphoblastoid cell line IM-9.;"A human monoclonal antibody (mAb), designated mNKES, was generated by fusing B cells isolated from an enlarged cervical lymph node of a patient with a carotid body tumor (CBT), with human myeloma cell line KR-12 (6TG). The reactivity of mNKES was tested by the indirect immunofluorescence method. The antigen defined by mNKES was expressed on Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines Raji, Daudi, and Ramos and on B lymphoblastoid cell line IM-9. In addition, mNKES reacted with T cells stimulated with recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) obtained from normal healthy donors. However, mNKES did not react with normal resting human T, B, or adherent cells (monocytes/macrophages). When the reactivity of mNKES and mouse mAbs recognizing the human adhesion-associated antigen (CD10, CD11a, CD11b, CD11c, CD14, CD16, CD18, CD23, CD28, CD29, CD31, CD43, CD44, CD45RA, CD50, CD54, CD58, CD80, CD102, CD106, and HLA class I, and HLA class II antigen) with various cell lines was compared, mNKES reactivity was found to be unique, not resembling that of any of these mouse mAbs. Interestingly, mNKES specifically and rapidly (within 2 hr) induced homotypic cell aggregation of IM-9 cells. This mNKES-induced cell aggregation was completely blocked by the addition of EDTA and when incubated at 4 degrees C. The mAbs reactive with CD11a/CD18 (leukocyte function-associated antigen-1; LFA-1) and CD54 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1; ICAM-1) completely blocked the IM-9 cell aggregation induced by mNKES, and induction of IM-9 cell aggregation by mNKES was significantly blocked in the presence of the protein kinase C inhibitors sphingosine and H-7 and completely blocked by cytochalasin B and cytochalasin D, which inhibit microfilament formation. Regarding biological function, IM-9 cells bearing surface IgG (sIgG) effectively promoted IgG-secreting activity underlying the homotypic cell aggregation induced by mNKES. The surface antigen recognized by mNKES has a molecular size of about 55 kDa, as determined by immunoblotting analysis. These findings indicate that mNKES recognizes a novel adhesion-associated antigen distinct from any previously reported adhesion-associated antigens in terms of pattern of cellular distribution and biological function and that mNKES is the first human mAb found that rapidly induces homotypic cell aggregation and effectively promotes the IgG-secreting activity of human B lymphoblastoid cell line IM-9.";-;antigen;-;hard_2

511;1930693;A human putative lymphocyte G0/G1 switch gene containing a CpG-rich island encodes a small basic protein with the potential to be phosphorylated.;Genes actively involved in the G0/G1 switch (G0S genes) may be differentially expressed during the lectin-induced switch of lymphocytes from the G0 to the G1 phases of the cell cycle. This paper presents studies of G0S2, a member of a set of putative G0S genes, for which cDNAs were cloned and selected on the basis of differential cDNA hybridization. G0S2 mRNA increases transiently within 1-2 hr of the addition of lectin or cycloheximide to cultured blood mononuclear cells. Comparison of a nearly full-length cDNA sequence with the corresponding genomic sequence reveals one small intron and an open reading frame in the second exon. The derived 103-amino-acid basic protein has two potential alpha-helical domains separated by a hydrophobic region with the potential to generate turns and assume a beta-sheet conformation. Consistent with involvement in the G0/G1 switch, the protein contains potential sites for phosphorylation by protein kinase C and casein kinase II. The gene contains a CpG-rich island suggesting expression in the germ line. An upstream segment contains tandem dinucleotide repeats (CT)19/(CA)16. There is a suitably located TATA box, but potential sites for CCAAT-box binding factors are far upstream, embedded in a 42-nucleotide repeat element. Potential sites for transcription factors AP1, AP2, and AP3 are consistent with rapid transcriptional activation in response to inducing agents. ;polyglycine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

MIBG uptake is decreased in nearly all patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Our objective was to evaluate MIBG uptake in patients with genetic PD. We investigated MIBG uptake in 14 patients with PD associated with mutations in different genes (Parkin, DJ-1, PINK1, and leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 -LRRK2), in 15 patients with idiopathic PD, and 10 control subjects. The myocardial MIGB uptake was preserved in 3 of the 4 Parkin-associated Parkinsonisms, in 1 of the 2 patients with DJ-1 mutations, in 1 of the 2 brothers with PINK1 mutations, in 3 of the 6 unrelated patients with Gly2019Ser mutation in the LRRK2 gene, whereas it was impaired in all patients with idiopathic PD. MIBG was preserved in all control subjects. Our study shows that myocardial MIGB uptake was normal in 8 of 14 patients with genetic PD, suggesting that cardiac sympathetic denervation occurs less frequently in genetic PD than in idiopathic PD. Our findings also demonstrate that MIGB uptake has a heterogeneous pattern in genetic PD, because it was differently impaired in patients with different mutations in the same gene or with the same gene mutation.; polyleucine ;-;-;LCR_without_function

After two subcutaneous inoculations of BSA formulated in each adjuvant, the NISV preparation was found to stimulate significantly higher total antibody production than FCA in mice carrying the H-2b haplotype at all time points measured after secondary inoculation (2, 5 and 10 weeks) and in Balb/c mice (H-2d) at two weeks after inoculation. Both adjuvants were found to overcome the apparent non-responsiveness of Balb/B mice (H-2b) to BSA alone. Analysis of the IgG subclass responses to BSA revealed a pattern of IgG1 but not IgG2a production similar to that for whole immunoglobulin. IgG1 responses invariably differed significantly, not only between adjuvant formulations but also between different H-2 haplotypes receiving the same inoculation. On the other hand, IgG2a responses did not differ significantly between H-2 haplotypes in animals given the same adjuvant preparations, although they did differ significantly in mice given BSA alone. Therefore, these results suggest that adjuvants cannot only circumvent antigen-specific non-responsiveness or low responsiveness, but also can induce antibody isotype switching independent of major histocompatibility complex controls.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
516;2833248;Characterization of the Mg2+-activated ATPase activity in smooth-muscle membranes. NADH oxidase and adenylate kinase interfere with the NADH-coupled enzyme assay.;The apparent Mg2+-activated ATPase activity measured by the continuous NADH-coupled enzyme assay was studied in a number of microsomal preparations obtained from smooth muscle of the myometrium from pregnant or 17 beta-oestradiol-pretreated rats, the bovine aorta, the guinea-pig taenia coli, the rabbit ear artery and pig antrum. It was shown that this ATPase assay is prone to the effects of a number of artefacts that are tissue-dependent. The apparent Mg2+-ATPase activity in microsomes (microsomal fractions) from myometrium, aorta and taenia coli declines non-linearly during the assay. Its initial high rate gradually diminishes over 15-60 min, depending on the type of smooth muscle, to a constant value. This decline depends on the presence of ATP and can be partially prevented by concanavalin A. The non-linearity is limited in microsomes from rabbit ear artery. In microsomes from antrum the apparent Mg2+-ATPase activity actually increases with time, albeit gradually. Storage on ice of the microsomes of the aorta, and especially of myometrium of pregnant rats and of taenia coli, is accompanied over a few hours after their preparation by a gradual suppression of the component of the Mg2+-ATPase activity that is inhibited by ATP. The Mg2+-ATPase activity in microsomes from antrum remains constant. NADH oxidase activity accounts for 10% of the Mg2+-ATPase activity in microsomes from stomach smooth muscle. The apparent initial non-linearity of the Mg2+-ATPase activity in that tissue is due to a time-dependent decrease of a rotenone-sensitive NADH oxidase activity. The adenylate kinase activity, as deduced from the effect of the adenylate kinase inhibitor P1,P5-di(adenosine-5') pentaphosphate, could account for 45.0, 35.0 and 31.0% respectively of the Mg2+-ATPase activity in microsomes from stomach, myometrium and aorta. No adenylate kinase activity could be detected in microsomes from ear artery and taenia coli. When microsomes from stomach smooth muscle were separated on a sucrose gradient, the contribution of adenylate kinase and NADH oxidase to the Mg2+-ATPase activity was most pronounced in the higher-density fractions. Part of the NADH oxidase activity and of the Mg2+-ATPase activity, and most of the adenylate kinase activity, are not sedimented at 224000 gmax. for 30 min and may therefore be present as soluble enzymes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS);-;kinase activity;-;hard_2
518;1365307;Isolation of plasma membranes from keratinocytes: a newly developed method allows the sensitive detection of the membrane antigen pattern in normal and psoriatic skin.;Distinct differences of proteins in the plasma membranes have been described in psoriatic keratinocytes as compared with normal epidermis. These changes are presumably involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. To identify and distinguish glycosylated proteins of the plasma membranes of keratinocytes, a method for mild preparation was developed that avoids the use of degrading or digestive enzymes. After cell lysis, three steps of centrifugation were performed, including the use of a sucrose step gradient. A fine-vesicular membrane fraction was obtained. Using marker enzymes for cell compartments, no contamination of cell nuclei or mitochondria and only 0.4% of endoplasmic reticulum was detectable in the final membrane fraction. Based on this preparation, disc-polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, followed by Western blotting, were performed. Staining with five different lectins to visualize glycosylated proteins allowed 75 different membrane glycoproteins to be distinguished. The patterns of normal, transformed (HaCaT), foreskin and psoriatic keratinocytes after cell culture with one passage were compared. Up to six proteins per lectin staining were expressed differently in psoriatic as compared to normal keratinocytes. Psoriatic cells shared similarities with highly proliferative foreskin cells, but not with transformed HaCaT cells. Main alterations of glycosylation were detected in the fucose content. In conclusion, the method developed for isolation of plasma membranes allows selective and sensitive examination of plasma membranes of normal and pathological keratinocytes. The glycosylation patterns observed suggest that distinct membrane proteins may be involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
519;30790148;Network of microRNA-transcriptional factor-mRNA in cold response of turbot Scophthalmus maximus.;The aim of this study is to understand fish cold-tolerant mechanism. We analyzed the transcriptional reactions to the cold condition in turbot Scophthalmus maximus by using RNA-seq and microRNA (miRNA)-seq. Meio-gynogenetic diploid turbots were treated at 0 °C to distinguish the cold-tolerant (CT) and cold-sensitive (CS) groups. The results showed that there were quite different responses at both mRNA and miRNA levels, with more up-regulated mRNAs (1069 vs. 194) and less down-regulated miRNAs (4 vs. 1) in CT versus CS relative to the control group. The network of miRNA-transcription factor-mRNA, regulating turbot different response to cold stress, was constructed, which involved in cell cycle, component of cell membrane, signal transduction, and circadian rhythm pathways. The above information demonstrates mechanisms by which cold tolerance is increased in fish.;-;transcription factor;-;hard_2
523;2040621;Probing the functional role and localization of Escherichia coli ribosomal protein L16 with a monoclonal antibody.;A monoclonal antibody specific for Escherichia coli ribosomal protein L16 was prepared to test its effects on ribosome function and to locate L16 by immunoelectron microscopy. The antibody recognized L16 in 50 S subunits, but not in 70 S ribosomes. It inhibited association of ribosomal subunits at 10 mM Mg2+, but not at 15 mM Mg2+. Poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis and peptidyltransferase activities were completely inhibited when the L16 antibody was bound to 50 S subunits at a molar ratio of 1. There was no inhibitory effect on the binding of elongation factors or on the associated GTPase activities. Fab fragments of the antibody gave the same result as the intact antibody. Chemical modification of the single histidine (His13) by diethyl pyrocarbonate destroyed antibody binding. Electron microscopy of negatively stained antibody subunit complexes showed antibody binding beside the central protuberance of the 50 S particle on the side away from the L7/L12 stalk and on or near the interface between the two subunits. This site of antibody binding is fully consistent with its biochemical effects that indicate that protein L16 is essential for the peptidyltransferase activity activity of protein biosynthesis and is at or near the subunit interface.;polyphenylalanine;-;-;LCR_without_function

529;10524206;Alternative splicing of CD45 pre-mRNA is uniquely obedient to conditions in lymphoid cells.;The leucocyte common antigen (LCA or CD45) consists of various isoforms generated by alternative splicing of variable exons 4, 5 and 6 (or A, B and C). To follow splicing behaviour in different cell types we developed a human CD45 mini-gene and analysed its expression in transfected cell lines and transgenic mouse tissues. In Cos-1, HeLa and 3T3 cells we found distinct expression patterns which could only be modulated slightly by protein synthesis inhibitors but not by variation in culture conditions like pH, serum concentration and cell density, or by stimulation with phorbol ester (TPA). In all non-lymphoid transgenic tissues the default splicing pattern (CD45R0) was found, while the expression profile in lymphoid cells, where all eight isoforms are present, mimics that of the endogenous mouse LCA gene products. Next, to examine the factors involved in alternative exon use we analysed the expression pattern of members of the family of SR proteins, well known splicing regulators with arginine/serine-rich (R/S) domains. Cell lines expressed variable levels of SRp75, SRp30 and SRp20 and constant amounts of SRp40. Mouse tissues expressed large amounts of SRp75, SRp55 and SRp40, additional expression of SRp30s and SRp20 was restricted to lymphoid tissues. Therefore, SRp30 and SRp20 may contribute to forming the appropriate cellular conditions for alternative use of CD45 exons 4-6 in the haematopoietic compartment. ;polyserine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
530;2308161;Generation of skeletal, smooth and low molecular weight non-muscle tropomyosin isoforms from the chicken tropomyosin 1 gene.;We have determined the organization of the chicken tropomyosin 1 gene by sequencing the cloned genomic DNA. The single-copy gene spans approximately 11,000 bases and includes 12 exons. Comparison of cDNA and genomic sequences demonstrates that three tissue-specific tropomyosins are encoded by the gene: a 284 amino acid skeletal muscle beta-tropomyosin, a 284 amino acid smooth muscle tropomyosin, and a 248 amino acid non-muscle (fibroblast) beta-tropomyosin. Skeletal and smooth muscle transcripts use the same putative promoter and transcription initiation site. However, they are alternatively spliced to generate mRNAs that differ in the region giving rise to amino acids 188 to 213 and 258 through the poly(A) site. The fibroblast transcript uses a promoter, initiation site and first exon that is distinct from that used for both the smooth and the skeletal muscle transcripts. However, beyond the first exon the fibroblast transcript undergoes splicing and polyadenylation that is identical with the smooth muscle transcript.; polyalanine ;-;-;LCR_without_function
532;10026171;Identification of low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-2/megalin as an endocytic receptor for seminal vesicle secretory protein II.;The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-2/megalin (LRP-2) is an endocytic receptor that is expressed on the apical surfaces of epithelial cells lining specific regions of the male and female reproductive tracts. In the present study, immunohistochemical staining revealed that LRP-2 is also expressed by epithelial cells lining the ductal region and the ampulla of the rat seminal vesicle. To identify LRP-2 ligands in the seminal vesicle, we probed seminal vesicle fluid with 125I-labeled LRP-2 in a gel-blot overlay assay. A 100-kDa protein (under non-reducing conditions) was found to bind the radiolabeled receptor. The protein was isolated and subjected to protease digestion, and the proteolytic fragments were subjected to mass spectroscopic sequence analysis. As a result, the 100-kDa protein was identified as the seminal vesicle secretory protein II (SVS-II), a major constituent of the seminal coagulum. Using purified preparations of SVS-II and LRP-2, solid-phase binding assays were used to show that the SVS-II bound to the receptor with high affinity (Kd = 5.6 nM). The binding of SVS-II to LRP-2 was inhibited using a known antagonist of LRP-2 function, the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein RAP. Using a series of recombinant subfragments of SVS-II, the LRP-2 binding site was mapped to a stretch of repeated 13-residue modules located in the central portion of the SVS-II polypeptide. To evaluate the ability of LRP-2 to mediate 125I-SVS-II endocytosis and lysosomal degradation, ligand clearance assays were performed using differentiated mouse F9 cells, which express high levels of LRP-2. Radiolabeled SVS-II was internalized and degraded by the cells, and both processes were inhibited by antibodies to LRP-2 or by RAP. The results indicate that LRP-2 binds SVS-II and can mediate its endocytosis leading to lysosomal degradation.;-;-;-;hard_0
534;1322966;Possible existence of two subsets of platelet-activating factor receptor to mediate polyphosphoinositide breakdown and calcium influx in neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid NG 108-15 cells.;Platelet-activating factor (PAF) initiated polyphosphoinositide (polyPI) breakdown and a rise of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid NG 108-15 cells. The accumulation of [3H]inositol trisphosphate and [3H]inositol bisphosphate was evident within 15 s after PAF stimulation, peaked at 1 min, and then gradually decayed. The increase in [3H]inositol monophosphate level was observed at 30 s, plateaued in 5 min, and was sustained up to 10 min in the presence of 10 mM LiCl. On the other hand, the rise of [Ca2+]i evoked by PAF reached a peak within 8-12 s and returned to basal levels within 1 min as measured in fura 2-loaded cells. When cells were suspended in Ca(2+)-depleted medium, the PAF-induced [Ca2+]i rise was reduced by 80%, indicating that the increase of [Ca2+]i was predominantly due to the Ca2+ influx from an extracellular source. Both PAF-induced accumulation of 3H-labeled inositol phosphates and [Ca2+]i elevation were concentration dependent with EC50 values of approximately 1 x 10(-10) and 5 x 10(-8) M, respectively. The PAF analogs 1-O-hexadecyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1-O-hexadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycerol-3-phosphocholine were much poorer agonists at eliciting the same responses in these cells. Pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin caused a substantial inhibition of PAF-induced accumulation of 3H-inositol phosphates.

535;15479836;Identification of a negative regulatory element in the Epstein-Barr virus Zta transactivation domain that is regulated by the cell cycle control factors c-Myc and E2F1.;Reactivation in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is closely associated with a G(0)/G(1) cell cycle arrest which can be induced either by lytic cycle-inducing agents or by the immediate-early gene product Zta. Accumulating evidence shows that in epithelial cells, downregulation of the proto-oncogene, c-myc, plays an important role in lytic cycle-associated cell growth arrest. Here, we provide evidence that c-Myc provides a gatekeeper function to ensure that certain cell cycle inhibitory events have been capitulated prior to full progression into the lytic cycle. Specifically, we show that reconstitution of c-Myc expression during the lytic cycle to levels observed in cycling uninduced cells inhibits the transactivation function of Zta. Nuclear localization studies show that c-Myc does not grossly alter the nuclear localization of Zta or its association with the insoluble nuclear fraction. Enforced expression of another transcription factor that promotes cell cycle progression, E2F1, also inhibits Zta transactivation. Analysis of c-Myc- and E2F1-mediated inhibition of a panel of Zta mutants shows parallel genetics and inhibition maps to a small bipartite sequence located between amino acids 29 and 53 of Zta, containing homology to the proline-rich domain of the tumor suppressor protein p53. Mutation of a conserved tryptophan residue located at amino acid 49 of Zta largely prevents inhibition by both c-Myc and E2F1. These studies identify a negative regulatory element within the Zta activation domain that is regulated by the cell cycle-promoting factors c-Myc and E2F1. ;polyproline;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
538;10207097;Activation of somatostatin receptor II expression by transcription factors MIBP1 and SEF-2 in the murine brain.;Somatostatin receptor type II expression in the mammalian brain displays a spatially and temporally very restricted pattern. In an investigation of the molecular mechanisms controlling these patterns, we have recently shown that binding of the transcription factor SEF-2 to a novel initiator element in the SSTR-2 promoter is essential for SSTR-2 gene expression. Further characterization of the promoter identified a species-conserved TC-rich enhancer element. By screening a mouse brain cDNA expression library, we cloned a cDNA encoding the transcription factor MIBP1. MIBP1 interacts specifically with both the TC box in the SSTR-2 promoter and with the SEF-2 initiator-binding protein to enhance transcription from the basal SSTR-2 promoter. We then investigated SSTR-2, SEF-2, and MIBP1 mRNA expression patterns in the developing and adult murine brain by Northern blotting and in situ hybridization. While SEF-2 is widely expressed in many neuronal and nonneuronal tissues, MIBP1 expression overlapped precisely with expression of SSTR-2 in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. In summary, our data for the first time define a regulatory role for the transcription factor MIBP1 in mediating spatially and temporally regulated SSTR-2 expression in the brain. ;polycysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
541;197093;Identification, characterization, and quantitative measurement of cyclic AMP receptor proteins in cytosol of various tissues using a photoaffinity ligand.;Two protein bands, present in cytosol fractions from each of seven rat tissues examined, specifically incorporated 32P-labeled 8-azidoadenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (8-N3-[32P]cAMP), a photoaffinity label for cAMP-binding sites. These proteins had apparent molecular weights of 47,000 and 54,000 on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis system. These two proteins were characterized in three of the tissues, namely, heart, uterus, and liver, by the total amount of 8-N3-[32P]cAMP incorporation, by the dissociation constant (Kd) for 8-N3-[32P]cAMP, and by the nucleotide specific inhibition of 8-N3-[32P]cAMP incorporation. Several lines of evidence were obtained that the protein with an apparent molecular weight of 47,000 represents the regulatory subunit of a type I cAMP-dependent protein kinase, while the protein with an apparent molecular weight of 54,000 represents the regulatory subunit of a type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Almost all of the cAMP receptor protein found in the cytosol of these tissues, as measured by 8-N3-[32P]cAMP incorporation, was associated with these two protein kinases, in agreement with the idea that most effects of cAMP are mediated through protein kinases. The photoaffinity labeling with 8-N3-[32P]cAMP can be used to estimate quantitatively the amounts of regulatory subunit of type I and type II cAMP-dependent protein kinases in various tissues.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
549;6436034;Induced latent allotypes within rabbit anti-cross-reactive idiotype reagents. Direct immunoelectron microscopic evidence.;"Immunization of rabbits with anti-VHa allotype antibody leads to the production of an ""anti-cross-reactive idiotype (IdX)"" reagent which appears to recognize a highly conserved IdX on anti-allotype antibodies. In many rabbits, a large percentage of this ""anti-IdX"" reagent does not express the nominal VHa framework allotype of the rabbit from which it was derived and is otherwise serologically indistinguishable from the original antigen, i.e. a1 or a2 allotype. To determine whether these anti-IdX molecules were in fact anti-IdX (or internal images) or were induced immunoglobulins bearing latent VHa allotypes, immunoelectron microscopic analysis of the molecules in complex with Fab anti-allotype antibody was conducted. The results show that the complexes do not resemble idiotype-anti-idiotype interactions but are essentially indistinguishable from allotype-anti-allotype complexes. We conclude that a major component of the ""anti-idiotype"" response of these anti-VHa-immunized rabbits is the production of Ig molecules bearing latent VHa allotypes.";-;antigen;-;hard_2

TT from different manufacturers proved to be greatly different in free amino group content and differed in ability to participate in the coupling reaction. Reasonably good replication of the coupling reaction was obtained with different production lots from the same manufacturer. Inferior antigenic response was obtained with the products of coupling beta-hCG to H. pertussis, influenza vaccine, polylysine, pneumococcus polysaccharide, or E. coli polysaccharide.

553;34659241;Siglec-7 Mediates Immunomodulation by Colorectal Cancer-Associated Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. animalis.;Fusobacterium nucleatum is involved in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC) through innate immune cell modulation. However, the receptors of the interaction between F. nucleatum ssp. and immune cells remain largely undetermined. Here, we showed that F. nucleatum ssp. animalis interacts with Siglecs (sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins) expressed on innate immune cells with highest binding to Siglec-7. Binding to Siglec-7 was also observed using F. nucleatum-derived outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). F. nucleatum and its derived OMVs or LPS induced a pro-inflammatory profile in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) and a tumour associated profile in human monocyte-derived macrophages (moMϕs). Siglec-7 silencing in moDCs or CRISPR-cas9 Siglec-7-depletion of U-937 macrophage cells altered F. nucleatum induced cytokine but not marker expression. The molecular interaction between Siglec-7 and the LPS O-antigen purified from F. nucleatum ssp. animalis was further characterised by saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR spectroscopy, revealing novel ligands for Siglec-7. Together, these data support a new role for Siglec-7 in mediating immune modulation by F. nucleatum strains and their OMVs through recognition of LPS on the bacterial cell surface. This opens a new dimension in our understanding of how F. nucleatum promotes CRC progression through the generation of a pro-inflammatory environment and provides a molecular lead for the development of novel cancer therapeutic approaches targeting F. nucleatum-Siglec-7 interaction.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
554;8455562;Integration host factor (IHF) modulates the expression of the pyrimidine-specific promoter of the carAB operons of Escherichia coli K12 and Salmonella typhimurium LT2.;We report the identification of Integration Host Factor (IHF) as a new element involved in modulation of P1, the upstream pyrimidine-specific promoter of the Escherichia coli K12 and Salmonella typhimurium carAB operons. Band-shift assays, performed with S-30 extracts of the wild type and a himA, hip double mutant or with purified IHF demonstrate that, in vitro, this factor binds to a region 300 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site of P1 in both organisms. This was confirmed by deletion analysis of the target site. DNase I, hydroxyl radical and dimethylsulphate footprinting experiments allowed us to allocate the IHF binding site to a 38 bp, highly A+T-rich stretch, centred around nucleotide -305 upstream of the transcription initiation site. Protein-DNA contacts are apparently spread over a large number of bases and are mainly located in the minor groove of the helix. Measurements of carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase (CPSase) and beta-galactosidase specific activities from car-lacZ fusion constructs of wild type or IHF target site mutants introduced into several genetic backgrounds affected in the himA gene or in the pyrimidine-mediated control of P1 (carP6 or pyrH+/-), or in both, indicate that, in vivo, IHF influences P1 activity as well as its control by pyrimidines. IHF stimulates P1 promoter activity in minimal medium, but increases the repressibility of this promoter by pyrimidines. These antagonistic effects result in a two- to threefold reduction in the repressibility of promoter P1 by pyrimidines in the absence of IHF binding. IHF thus appears to be required for maximal expression as well as for establishment of full repression. IHF could exert this function by modulating the binding of a pyrimidine-specific regulatory molecule. ;polythreonine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
565;22079048;Prediction of short linear protein binding regions.;Short linear motifs in proteins (typically 3-12 residues in length) play key roles in protein-protein interactions by frequently binding specifically to peptide binding domains within interacting proteins. Their tendency to be found in disordered segments of proteins has meant that they have often been overlooked. Here we present SLiMPred (short linear motif predictor), the first general de novo method designed to computationally predict such regions in protein primary sequences independent of experimentally defined homologs and interactors. The method applies machine learning techniques to predict new motifs based on annotated instances from the Eukaryotic Linear Motif database, as well as structural, biophysical, and biochemical features derived from the protein primary sequence. We have integrated these data sources and benchmarked the predictive accuracy of the method, and found that it performs equivalently to a predictor of protein binding regions in disordered regions, in addition to having predictive power for other classes of motif sites such as polyproline II helix motifs and short linear motifs lying in ordered regions. It will be useful in predicting peptides involved in potential protein associations and will aid in the functional characterization of proteins, especially of proteins lacking experimental information on structures and interactions. We conclude that, despite the diversity of motif sequences and structures, SLiMPred is a valuable tool for prioritizing potential interaction motifs in proteins. ;polyproline;helix;-;LCR_with_function
567;21069748;Mitochondrial fission and cristae disruption increase the response of cell models of Huntington's disease to apoptotic stimuli.;Huntington's disease (HD), a genetic neurodegenerative disease caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the Huntingtin (Htt) protein, is accompanied by multiple mitochondrial alterations. Here, we show that mitochondrial fragmentation and cristae alterations characterize cellular models of HD and participate in their increased susceptibility to apoptosis. In HD cells, the increased basal activity of the phosphatase calcineurin dephosphorylates the pro-fission dynamin related protein 1 (Drp1), increasing its mitochondrial translocation and activation, and ultimately leading to fragmentation of the organelle. The fragmented HD mitochondria are characterized by cristae alterations that are aggravated by apoptotic stimulation. A genetic analysis indicates that correction of mitochondrial elongation is not sufficient to rescue the increased cytochrome c release and cell death observed in HD cells. Conversely, the increased apoptosis can be corrected by manoeuvres that prevent fission and cristae remodelling. In conclusion, the cristae remodelling of the fragmented HD mitochondria contributes to their hypersensitivity to apoptosis.;polyglutamine;-;-;LCR_without_function
568;6967510;Identification of the membrane glycoprotein that is the C3b receptor of the human erythrocyte, polymorphonuclear leukocyte, B lymphocyte, and monocyte.;"A human erythrocyte membrane glycoprotein of 205,000 mol wt (gp205) has been identified as the C3b receptor of the erythrocyte, polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN), B lymphocyte, and monocyte. Initially, gp205 was sought and characterized as a constituent of the human erythrocyte membrane that can impair activation of the alternative complement pathway by inducing loss of function of the properdin-stabilized amplification C3 convertase (C3b,Bb,P) through displacement of Bb from C3b and by promoting cleavage-inactivation of C3b by C3b inactivator. These inhibitory activities of gp205 suggested that this membrane glyeoprotein had an affinity for C3b and prompted an analysis of its possible identity as the C3b receptor of human peripheral blood cells. The F(ab')2 fragment of rabbit IgG anti-gp205 inhibited the formation of rosettes with sheep EC3b of human erythroeytes, B lymphocytes, monocytes and PMN in a dose-response manner; the 50 percent inhibitory doses were 0.13/mug/ml, 0.90 mug/ml, 1.25 mug/ml, and 1.20 mug/ml of F(ab')2, respectively. Anti-gp205 did not impair the formation of rosettes by monocytes and B lymphocytes with sheep EC3bi or with EC3d. Scatchard analysis of the number of specific (125)I-F(ab')(2) anti-gp205 binding sites/cell revealed 950 sites/erythrocyte, 21,000 sites/cell of B lymphocyte preparation, 57,000 sites/PMN, and 48,000 sites/monocyte, indicating that the higher concentrations of antibody that had been required for inhibition of rosette formation by the nucleated cells reflected larger numbers of receptors on these cells. Direct evidence for the identity of gp205 as the C3b receptor of the four cell types was obtained when detergent-solubilized membrane proteins of the surface-radioiodinated cells were reacted with anti- gp205 and the immunoprecipitate was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. In each instance, the antigenic material reacting with anti-gp205 represented a single protein with an apparent 205,000 mol wt.

569;7865887;Nuclear mRNA accumulation causes nucleolar fragmentation in yeast mtr2 mutant.;We have identified a set of genes that affect mRNA transport (mtr) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. One of these genes, MTR2, has been cloned and shown to encode a novel 21-kDa nuclear protein that is essential for vegetative growth. MTR2 shows limited homology to a protein implicated in plasmid DNA transfer in Escherichia coli. PolyA+RNA accumulates within the nucleus of mtr2-1 in two to three foci at 37 degrees C. mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA synthesis continue as do pre-mRNA splicing, tRNA processing, and rRNA export at 37 degrees C. Under these conditions the polyA tail length increases, and protein synthesis is progressively inhibited. Nucleolar antigens also redistribute to two to three nuclear foci at 37 degrees C, and this redistribution depends on ongoing transcription by RNA polymerase II. Surprisingly, these foci coincide with the sites of polyA+RNA accumulation. Comparable colocalization and dependance on RNA polymerase II transcription is seen for the mtr1-1 mutant. The disorganization of the nucleolus thus depends on mRNA accumulation in these mutants. We discuss the possible functions of MTR2 and the yeast nucleolus in mRNA export. ;polyalanine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

To elucidate the cause of spontaneous involution of ICH, the apoptotic and proliferative activities in seven cases of ICH were compared with those in five cases of lobular capillary haemangioma (LCH), using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections. The number of apoptotic cells detected by the modified in situ end-labelling method was significantly higher in ICH than in LCH, while the proliferative activities evaluated with mitosis and Ki-67 antigen expression did not differ significantly. Lewisy (Ley) antigen, an apoptosis-associated marker, was expressed in all cases of ICH but in none of LCH, while labelling for p53 protein and bcl-2 protein was almost completely negative in both tumours. These findings clearly demonstrate a much higher apoptotic activity in ICH than in LCH and suggest that apoptosis might be a cause of the spontaneous involution of ICH.;-;antigen;-;hard_2

Here, a stimuli-responsive nanoparticle system is presented for multiplexed magneto-enrichment and non-instrumented lateral flow strip detection of model antigens from spiked pooled plasma. The integrated reagent system allows purification and enrichment of the gold-labeled biomarker half-sandwich that can be applied directly to lateral flow test strips. A linear diblock copolymer with a thermally responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAm) segment and a gold-binding block composed of NIPAm-co-N,N-dimethylaminoethylacrylamide was prepared by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization. The diblock copolymer was used to functionalize gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), with subsequent bioconjugation to yield thermally responsive pNIPAm-AuNPs that were co-decorated with streptavidin. These AuNPs efficiently complexed biotinylated capture antibody reagents that were bound to picomolar quantities of pan-aldolase and Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) in spiked pooled plasma samples. The gold-labeled biomarker half-sandwich was then purified and enriched using 10 nm thermally responsive magnetic nanoparticles that were similarly decorated with pNIPAm. When a thermal stimulus was applied in conjunction with a magnetic field, coaggregation of the AuNP half-sandwiches with the pNIPAm-coated iron oxide nanoparticles created large aggregates that were efficiently magnetophoresed and separated from bulk serum. The purified biomarkers from a spiked pooled plasma sample could be concentrated 50-fold into a small volume and applied directly to a commercial multiplexed lateral flow strip to dramatically improve the signal-to-noise ratio and test sensitivity. ;polyhistidine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

Purified RNA helicase fractions displaced a hybrid of U4/U6 RNAs with the same efficiency as it displaced other duplex RNA structures. In contrast, the RNA helicase did not displace duplex RNA/DNA and DNA/DNA structures. Evidence is presented that suggests that this RNA helicase can displace duplex RNA by translocating in both the 3' to 5' and the 5' to 3' directions. The properties of the RNA helicase described here differ from the deaminase RNA unwinding activity described in Xenopus oocytes (Bass, B.L., and Weintraub, H. (1987) Cell 48, 607-613) and from the p68 HeLa RNA helicase (Hirling, H., Scheffner, M., Restle, T., and Stahl, H. (1989) Nature 339, 562-564).;-;phosphatase activity;polyacrylamide;hard_3
585;6372040;Interactions among microorganisms of the indigenous intestinal flora and their influence on the host.;The animal host and its intestinal microbial flora function together as a complex ecologic system in which there is a significant impact of the intestinal flora on the host as well as of components of the microbial flora on one another. Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of the intestinal flora influence numerous anatomic, physiologic, and immunologic parameters of the host. Constituents of the indigenous intestinal flora also engage in a multitude of antagonistic and cooperative interactions. The normal bacterial intestinal flora represents an extremely important defense mechanism, which effectively interferes with the establishment of many important enteric pathogens. Mechanisms by which microorganisms suppress the growth of other microorganisms include modification of bile acids, stimulation of peristalsis, induction of immunologic responses, depletion of essential substrates from the environment, competition for attachment sites, creation of restrictive physiologic environments, and elaboration of antibiotic-like substances. Components of the intestinal microbial flora also interact synergistically in the induction of disease or the utilization of substrate.;-;-;-;hard_0
586;6896661;The binding of simian virus 40 large T antigen to the polyphosphate backbone of nucleic acids.;Simian virus 40 (SV40) large tumor antigen (T antigen), a phosphoprotein found in nuclei of SV40-infected and -transformed cells, binds nonspecifically to DNA. To study this mechanism the binding properties of T antigen to double-stranded (ds) and single-stranded (ss) DNA-cellulose as well as to phosphocellulose were compared. After incubation of [35S] methionine or [3H] leucine/[32 P] phosphate radioactively-labeled cell extracts at different pH values (6.0, 7.3, 9.0) with DNA- or phosphocellulose, bound and unbound species of T antigen were purified and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for both the yield and the possible correlation with protein phosphorylation. T antigens bound with comparable affinities to ds- and ss-DNA-cellulose and phosphocellulose. These results suggest the binding of T antigen to the polyphosphate backbone of DNA as a molecular mechanism for its nonspecific binding. The evidence for this observation was supported by blocking the binding of T antigen to DNA-cellulose by divalent  cations (Ca2+, Mg2+). 3H/32P ratios of T antigen obtained by double-labeling cells for various times imply that higher phosphorylated forms of T antigen bound more strongly to ds- and ss-DNA as well as to phosphocellulose. Thus, in the presence of cellular proteins and other components the binding activity of T antigen to the polyphosphate backbone of DNA seems to be positively correlated with its phosphorylation. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the binding affinities of SV40 T antigen to host cell DNA may be regulated by its phosphorylation.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
588;3233789;A characteristic immunoblotting pattern for Opisthorchiasis sera with metacercarial antigens.;The protein compositions of homogenized metacercaria and adult Opisthorchis viverrini were characterized by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The two different stages of O. viverrini parasite contained several protein components with very similar mobilities on SDS-PAGE gel. The reaction in immunoblots of sera from patients with opisthorchiasis demonstrated antibodies against heterogeneous protein components of metacercariae and adult O. viverrini parasites. Only the components of metacercariae with molecular weights of 190-200 kD, 132 kD and 107 kD reacted specifically with opisthorchiasis sera. This characteristic reaction pattern was not observed in any control sera of normal subjects or those infected with other parasites. Identical reactions were however also recognized in the sera of experimental infected hamsters with metacercariae, but did not occur with adult worm as the antigen for the immunoblotting reaction. This may indicate that these metacercariae-associated protein components have potential diagnostic value for opisthorchiasis.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3

In order to investigate the mechanism of immobilization, several experiments were performed using a previously characterized monoclonal antibody (TAT-30) against a molecular weight (Mr) = 120,000 protein that is secreted by Sertoli cells and epithelial cells of the sperm duct, and is also bound to the head of the spermatozoon. First, we assessed sperm motility in the seminal plasma protein fraction (SPP), and demonstrated that the sperm motility is inhibited by SPP in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, sperm motility was recovered if SPP was pretreated with TAT-30, suggesting that the TAT-30 antigen is one of the components of the sperm immobilizing factor. Calibration by gel filtration followed by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and western blotting with TAT-30 demonstrated that the sperm immobilizing factor was more than Mr = 1,000,000 in seminal plasma, suggesting that it is a homopolymer of the Mr = 120,000-TAT-30 positive protein. Additionally, lectin blot analysis showed that the TAT-30 antigen was reactive with Lens culinarin agglutinin (LCA) and Conavalia ensiformis agglutinin (ConA), indicating that it is a glycoprotein. Immunohistochemical studies showed that the TAT-30 antigen was localized specifically on the heads of spermatozoa and on the apical surface, lysosomes and rough endoplasmic reticulum of Sertoli cells.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3

591;8083158;Trehalose-6-phosphate hydrolase of Escherichia coli.;The disaccharide trehalose acts as an osmoprotectant as well as a carbon source in Escherichia coli. At high osmolarity of the growth medium, the cells synthesize large amounts of trehalose internally as an osmoprotectant. However, they can also degrade trehalose as the sole source of carbon under both high- and low-osmolarity growth conditions. The modes of trehalose utilization are different under the two conditions and have to be well regulated (W. Boos, U. Ehmann, H. Forkl, W. Klein, M. Rimmele, and P. Postma, J. Bacteriol. 172:3450-3461, 1990). At low osmolarity, trehalose is transported via a trehalose-specific enzyme II of the phosphotransferase system, encoded by treB. The trehalose-6-phosphate formed internally is hydrolyzed to glucose and glucose 6-phosphate by the key enzyme of the system, trehalose-6-phosphate hydrolase, encoded by treC. We have cloned treC, contained in an operon with treB as the promoter-proximal gene. We have overproduced and purified the treC gene product and identified it as a protein consisting of a single polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of 62,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme hydrolyzes trehalose-6-phosphate with a Km of 6 mM and a Vmax of at least 5.5 mumol of trehalose-6-phosphate hydrolyzed per min per mg of protein. The enzyme also very effectively hydrolyzes p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside, but it does not recognize trehalose, sucrose, maltose, isomaltose, or maltodextrins. treC was sequenced and found to encode a polypeptide with a calculated molecular weight of 63,781. The amino acid sequence deduced from the DNA sequence shows homology (50% identity) with those of oligo-1,6-glucosidases (sucrase-isomaltases) of Bacillus spp. but not with those of other disaccharide phosphate hydrolases. This report corrects our previous view on the function of the treC gene product as an amylotrehalase, which was based on the analysis of the metabolic products of trehalose metabolism in whole cells.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
592;1120960;Inhibition of chondromucoprotein synthesis: an extraneuronal effect of nerve growth factor.;Nerve growth factor (NGF) is probably made by many extraneural tissues and some mesenchymal tumors. The present study investigated the effects of NGF on the in vitro synthesis of macromolecules by embryonic chicken cartilage. Cartilage deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid synthesis as estimated by radioactive thymidine and uridine incorporation were unaltered by NGF. Chondromucoprotein synthesis as determined by 35SO4 incorporation into cartilage proteins was significantly inhibited by as little as 2 mug/ml of NGF and markedly inhibited (65-82 percent) by 20 mug/ml. Total cartilage protein synthesis as indicated by the incorporation of radioactive leucine was slightly (14 percent) but significantly inhibited by NGF. Fractionation of cartilage proteins into collagen-rich and chondromucoprotein-rich fractions and further purification by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that all of the inhibition of leucine incorporation was due to the inhibition of chondromucoprotein synthesis. Thus NGF causes a selective and unique inhibition of cartilage chondromucoprotein synthesis.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1

The specific activity of the purified enzyme was 32,000 times that of the 15,000 x g supernatant of the embryo homogenate, and the enzyme was pure when examined by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using three different gel compositions. The molecular weight of the enzyme was about 72,000-78,000 by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the value being dependent on the gel composition. The apparent molecular weight by gel filtration was dependent on the purity and protein concentration. The sedimentation coefficient S20,w was 4.7.

594;22045996;Phylogenetic analysis of the teneurins: conserved features and premetazoan ancestry.;Teneurins are type II transmembrane proteins expressed during pattern formation and neurogenesis with an intracellular domain that can be transported to the nucleus and an extracellular domain that can be shed into the extracellular milieu. In Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and mouse the knockdown or knockout of teneurin expression can lead to abnormal patterning, defasciculation, and abnormal pathfinding of neurites, and the disruption of basement membranes. Here, we have identified and analyzed teneurins from a broad range of metazoan genomes for nuclear localization sequences, protein interaction domains, and furin cleavage sites and have cloned and sequenced the intracellular domains of human and avian teneurins to analyze alternative splicing. The basic organization of teneurins is highly conserved in Bilateria: all teneurins have epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats, a cysteine-rich domain, and a large region identical in organization to the carboxy-half of prokaryotic YD-repeat proteins. Teneurins were not found in the genomes of sponges, cnidarians, or placozoa, but the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis has a gene encoding a predicted teneurin with a transmembrane domain, EGF repeats, a cysteine-rich domain, and a region homologous to YD-repeat proteins. Further examination revealed that most of the extracellular domain of the M. brevicollis teneurin is encoded on a single huge 6,829-bp exon and that the cysteine-rich domain is similar to sequences found in an enzyme expressed by the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. This leads us to suggest that teneurins are complex hybrid fusion proteins that evolved in a choanoflagellate via horizontal gene transfer from both a prokaryotic gene and a diatom or algal gene, perhaps to improve the capacity of the choanoflagellate to bind to its prokaryotic prey. As choanoflagellates are considered to be the closest living relatives of animals, the expression of a primitive teneurin by an ancestral choanoflagellate may have facilitated the evolution of multicellularity and complex histogenesis in metazoa.;polycysteine;-;-;LCR_without_function
595;10333744;RNA recognition by arginine-rich peptide motifs.;A ubiquitious class of RNA-binding proteins is distinguished by an arginine-rich motif. Such proteins function in transcription, translation, RNA trafficking, and packaging. Peptide models are derived from viral regulatory proteins, including the virulence factors Tat and Rev of mammalian immunodeficiency viruses. Structures of model peptide-RNA complexes exhibit diverse strategies of recognition based in each case on structural transitions. Induced RNA structures contain noncanonical elements such as purine-purine mismatches, base triples, and flipped bases. Such elements enlarge and extend the RNA major groove to create specific peptide-binding pockets and surfaces. The repertoire of bound peptide structures--beta-hairpin, alpha-helix, and helix-bend-helix-reflects the diversity of induced RNA architectures. This repertoire, reminiscent of primordial exon-encoded peptides, may recapitulate early events in the transition between RNA and protein worlds. Peptide-directed changes in modern RNA structures can provide a mechanism of signaling in higher-order RNA-protein assemblies. ;polyarginine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

602;2710122;Octamer transcription factors 1 and 2 each bind to two different functional elements in the immunoglobulin heavy-chain promoter.;Immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes contain two conserved sequence elements 5' to the site of transcription initiation: the octamer ATGCAAAT and the heptamer CTCATGA. Both of these elements are required for normal cell-specific promoter function. The present study demonstrates that both the ubiquitous and lymphoid-cell-specific octamer transcription factors (OTF-1 and OTF-2, respectively) interact specifically with each of the two conserved sequence elements, forming either homo- or heterodimeric complexes. This was surprising, since the heptamer and octamer sequence motifs bear no obvious similarity to each other. Binding of either factor to the octamer element occurred independently. However, OTF interaction with the heptamer sequence appeared to require the presence of an intact octamer motif and occurred with a spacing of either 2 or 14 base pairs between the two elements, suggesting coordinate binding resulting from protein-protein interactions. The degeneracy in sequences recognized by the OTFs may be important in widening the range over which gene expression can be modulated and in establishing cell type specificity.;-;transcription factor;-;hard_2
603;9378239;Effect of a novel 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist, GK-128, on 5-HT3 receptors mediating contractions and relaxations in guinea-pig distal colon.;1. We investigated 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) receptor-mediating contractions and relaxations in the guinea-pig isolated distal colon using various 5-HT3 receptor agonists and antagonists, including GK-128 (2-[(2-methylimidazol-1-yl) methyl] benzo[f] thiochromen-1-one monohydrochloride hemihydrate). 2. Selective 5-HT3 receptor agonists, 2-methyl-5-HT and m-chlorophenylbiguanide, produced spantide-insensitive contraction and atropine-insensitive contraction and the relaxation. These agonists showed a small, but significant, difference of potency between contraction and relaxation. 3. GK-128 competitively blocked both 2-methyl-5-HT- and m-chlorophenylbiguanide-induced responses with similar potency. The affinities of GK-128 for spantide-insensitive contraction and atropine-insensitive contraction were ten-fold higher than for relaxation. 4. Other selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, azasetron and tropisetron, also exhibited higher affinity in contraction than in relaxation, but the extent of their affinity differences was smaller than that observed in GK-128. In contrast, granisetron, ramosetron and ondansetron exhibited no significant differences in their affinity values among the three responses. 5. These results suggest that the 5-HT3 receptors which mediate contraction and relaxation in the guinea-pig distal colon may not be the same, and that GK-128 is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with a stronger potency for contraction.;-;-;-;hard_0
606;1671006;Susceptibility to type I diabetes in women is associated with the CD3 epsilon locus on chromosome 11.;"Type I diabetes is associated with the DQ loci of the MHC and to a lesser extent with the T cell antigen receptor (TcR) beta chain genes. The non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse is an animal model of human diabetes, in which up to 90% of female mice develop overt insulin-dependent diabetes. Genetic studies in the NOD mouse suggest that there are at least three diabetogenic genes; one that maps to the MHC, another that may map to the mouse Thy-I locus, and a third that has still to be identified. We have investigated loci in the vicinity of the human Thy-I locus on chromosome 11q23 and report here the results of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the CD3 epsilon locus of 168 Caucasoid patients with type I diabetes.

608;9766899;The level of the collagen cross-link pyridinoline reflects the improvement of cutaneous lesions in one case of skin alveolar echinococcosis.;Cutaneous parasitic lesions, associated with a dense fibrous reaction, markedly improved under albendazole treatment in one case of supraumbilical skin localization of alveolar echinococcosis. Since collagen cross-linking increases during fibrogenesis and contributes to the stability of fibrotic lesions, we monitored the level of the cross-links pyridinoline and pentosidine in skin lesions from this patient to determine if they would reflect the changes occurring during treatment. We looked at the deposition of cross-linked type I collagen by immunohistochemistry and also measured the serum concentrations of pentosidine and of a fragment of type I collagen (ICTP), which contains a site of pyridinoline formation. Albendazole treatment did not affect either the collagen content of skin lesions or the serum concentrations of ICTP and pentosidine, but it led to a pronounced decrease in pyridinoline level concomitant with the disappearance, observed by immunohistochemistry, of extensively cross-linked fibrotic type I collagen. The follow-up of collagen cross-linking by pyridinoline in skin tissue thus appears to be useful in reflecting the improvement of fibrotic skin diseases during therapy.;-;-;-;hard_0
612;8168936;Characterization of fibrinolytic activities of Treponema denticola.;Several fibrinolytic activities of Treponema denticola, an oral spirochete associated with gingivitis and periodontal disease, were identified and characterized following phase partitioning with the nonionic detergent Triton X-114. The apparent molecular masses of the proteases ranged from 91 to 228 kDa when analyzed in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels containing fibrinogen as the protease substrate. A qualitative analysis of zymograms showed that the proteases were highly enriched in the detergent phase, although the 91-, 173-, and 228-kDa proteases were also found in the aqueous phase. Zymograms of crude outer sheaths prepared by repeated freezing-thawing revealed that the proteases may be associated with this subcellular compartment. The proteases displayed substrate specificity towards fibrinogen, were susceptible to sulfhydryl group reagents, and had a pH optimum between 7 and 8. The similarities in their sensitivity to inhibitors, temperature stability, pH optimum, and laddered protein profiles suggest that these hydrolytic enzymes may be part of a family of oligomeric proteases that may play an important role in the invasiveness of and tissue damage caused by the spirochete.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1

615;17663723;Identification of functional domains in TdIF1 and its inhibitory mechanism for TdT activity.;TdT interacting factor 1 (TdIF1) was identified as a protein that binds to terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT) to negatively regulate TdT activity. TdT is a template-independent DNA polymerase that catalyzes the incorporation of deoxynucleotides to the 3'-hydroxyl end of DNA templates to increase the junctional diversity of immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor (TcR) genes. Here, using bioinformatics analysis, we identified the TdT binding, DNA binding and dimerization regions, and nuclear localization signal (NLS) in TdIF1. TdIF1 bound to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) through three DNA binding regions: residues 1-75, the AT-hook-like motif (ALM) and the predicted helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif. ALM in TdIF1 preferentially bound to AT-rich DNA regions. NLS was of the bipartite type and overlapped ALM. TdIF1 bound to the Pol beta-like region in TdT and blocked TdT access to DNA ends. In the presence of dsDNA, however, TdIF1 bound to dsDNA to release TdT from the TdIF1/TdT complex and to exhibit TdT activity, implying that active TdT released microenvironmentally concentrates around AT-rich DNA to synthesize DNA. ;polythreonine;helix;-;LCR_with_function

618;3360801;Isoform composition and stoichiometry of the approximately 90-kDa heat shock protein associated with glucocorticoid receptors.;We have observed that the approximately 90-kDa non-steroid-binding component of nonactivated glucocorticoid receptors purified from WEHI-7 mouse thymoma cells (which has been identified as the approximately 90-kDa heat shock protein) consistently migrates as a doublet during polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing and reducing conditions. It has recently been reported that murine Meth A cells contain a tumor-specific transplantation antigen (TSTA) which is related or identical to the approximately 90-kDa heat shock protein (Ullrich, S.J., Robinson, E.A., Law, L.W., Willingham, M., and Appella, E. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 83, 3121-3125). The observation that TSTA and the approximately 90-kDa heat shock protein isolated from these cells exists as two isoforms of similar molecular mass and charge has suggested to us that the doublet we observed is also due to the existence of two isoforms. However, unlike TSTA, which appears to contain the two isoforms in similar relative abundance, nonactivated glucocorticoid-receptor complexes seem to contain predominantly the lower molecular mass isoform. We have therefore conducted this study to determine whether TSTA and the approximately 90-kDa component of glucocorticoid receptors are indeed related, to establish whether the receptor preferentially binds one isoform of the approximately 90-kDa heat shock protein, and to investigate the stoichiometry of the nonactivated receptor complex. By comparing Meth A TSTA and the approximately 90-kDa component of the receptor in their reactions with the AC88 monoclonal antibody (specific for the approximately 90-kDa heat shock protein) and a polyclonal antibody directed against Meth A TSTA, we found that these two proteins are indistinguishable and probably identical. We then used the BuGR1 (directed against the steroid-binding subunit of glucocorticoid receptors) and AC88 monoclonal antibodies to purify, respectively, receptor-associated and free approximately 90-kDa heat shock protein from WEHI-7 cells grown for 48 h with [35S]methionine to metabolically label proteins to steady state. Following analysis of the proteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing and reducing conditions, the relative amounts of the two isoforms in each sample were determined from the 35S counts and the known methionine content of each isoform. We found that approximately three-quarters of both the receptor-associated and the free approximately 90-kDa heat shock protein is present as the lower molecular weight isoform, indicating no preferential binding of either isoform in the receptor.

Both cross hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) and cross virus-neutralization tests revealed that a nonreciprocal or one way cross exists between RV propagated in rat embryo cell cultures (RE-RV) and RV propagated in suckling hamsters (H-RV). Specifically, immune serum to RE-RV inhibited hemagglutination and infectivity by both viruses to the same extent. Immune serum to H-RV, however, exhibited higher HI and neutralization titers to H-RV than to RE-RV. Infectivity studies demonstrated that, although both viruses were able to infect either host, the virus showed a higher infectivity titer for the last host in which it had been propagated. Serological studies indicated that H-RV possesses an antigen(s) not found on the RE-RV. This host-controlled variation did not result after a single passage in the new host, but rather required at least three passages for a complete conversion to occur, and did not appear to result from the incorporation of unaltered host antigens into the virus particle. Solubilization of purified RV propagated in each host with sodium dodecyl sulfate, 2-mercaptoethanol, and urea followed by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels indicated that the number of components in the protein of each virus was not the same.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3

Epidemiologic evidence has suggested a modifying role for antioxidant micronutrients, including tocopherols and carotenoids, in these disease processes. It has been suggested that oxidants in cigarette smoke could be involved. We exposed freshly obtained human plasma to the gas phase of cigarette smoke to assess its effects on tocopherols, carotenoids, and retinol. Exposure to cigarette smoke led to the depletion of most of the lipophilic antioxidants in 20 mL human plasma. The order of disappearance was lycopene > alpha-tocopherol > trans-beta-carotene++ > (lutein + zeaxanthin) = cryptoxanthin > gamma-tocopherol = retinol. However, despite a substantial loss of alpha-tocopherol, there was very little peroxidative damage to lipids, and no detectable change in the content of polyunsaturated fatty acid-rich cholesterol esters. We conclude that a wide spectrum of lipophilic micronutrients undergo degradation when exposed to gas-phase cigarette smoke. The relevance of these in vitro findings to possible cigarette smoke-induced depletions of respiratory tract lipophilic antioxidants remains to be clarified.;-;-;acid-rich;hard_1

Cross-reactivity between the isolates was examined by immunoblotting using one polyclonal serum and four monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), all raised against strain 956/2. The polyclonal serum revealed considerable antigenic heterogeneity, but at least nine major antigens were conserved across all isolates. Two MAbs cross-reacted with all 22 strains, but the other two MAbs allowed some differentiation of the strains. One (MO/3) divided the isolates into groups of 16 and 6 based on the presence of absence of a 26-kDa antigen. All strains isolated from sheep with pulmonary adenomatosis fell into the smaller group and did not possess the 26-kDa antigen.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3

629;1769968;Arginine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase and its acceptor protein p33 in chicken polymorphonuclear cells: co-localization in the cell granules, partial characterization, and in situ mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation.;We have reported the purification and characterization of arginine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase from hen liver nuclei [Tanigawa, Y. et al. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 2022-2029] and the DNA-dependent mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation of p33, an acceptor protein in the nuclei [Mishima, K. et al. (1989) Eur. J. Biochem. 179, 267-273]. In the present study, we obtained evidence that among various tissues and cells from chicken, polymorphonuclear cells, so-called heterophils, possess both the ADP-ribosyltransferase and p33 at high levels. Percoll density gradient centrifugation of the postnuclear fraction of the heterophils revealed the co-localization of ADP-ribosyltransferase with p33 in the granule fraction. The enzyme and p33 were purified approximately 219- and 3.77-fold, respectively, from postnuclear pellet fraction to apparent homogeneity. The properties of heterophil ADP-ribosyltransferase and p33 were compared with those of the liver enzyme and p33. The molecular mass of the heterophil enzyme was estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to be 27.5 kDa. The enzyme activity was stimulated by a sulfhydryl agent and inhibited by lysolecithin, NaCl, and inorganic phosphate. The mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation of p33 was markedly enhanced by polyanion, such as DNA, RNA, or poly(L-glutamate). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis after limited trypsin proteolysis of p33s, purified from chicken heterophils and liver, showed much the same pattern. Thus, it appears that ADP-ribosyltransferase and p33 present in heterophils are identical to those in the liver, respectively. p33 is considered to be an in situ substrate for ADP-ribosyltransferase, since it was specifically mono(ADP-ribosyl)ated in permeabilized heterophils.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS);-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
630;8116218;Biochemical and serological identification of major histocompatibility complex antigens in outbred chickens.;Serology and biochemistry were used to identify major histocompatibility complex (MHC) types in chicken lines selected for high and low antibody response to sheep red blood cells. Serological typing was performed by direct haemagglutination, using antisera obtained by erythrocyte alloimmunization within the lines. Four serotypes were identified, called preliminarily B114, B119, B121 and B124. Subsequently, these types were characterized for their B-G and B-F products by biochemical analysis, using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and one-dimensional IEF (isoelectric focusing) respectively. The B114, B119 and B121 serotypes displayed each characteristic banding patterns for both B-G and B-F. No additional types or subtypes were identified by biochemistry within these serotypes. The B124 serotype however could be subtyped into three different haplotypes with specific banding patterns for B-G and B-F. None of the haplotypes in the selection lines were identical for both B-G and B-F with the tested reference B haplotypes. Comparison of B-G alleles revealed similar, but not identical B-G patterns for B114 and B-G14, whereas B124C and B-G23, as well as B119 and B-G19 displayed indistinguishable patterns. For B-F, only B121 and B-F21 banding patterns were indistinguishable by IEF. All other B-F types differed from the reference types.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
632;16455577;Molecular mimicry in multiple sclerosis.;Two main etiological components are considered important in human autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis (MS), first the immunogenetic background and second environmental factors. Among the latter, infectious organisms are probably the most relevant, and epidemiological studies in MS firmly support that viral infections often precede disease exacerbations or the onset of MS. Infectious agents can contribute to disease development or phenotypic expression in different ways. Our focus will be directed on molecular mimicry, i.e. antigenic similarity between structural epitopes or peptide sequences from infectious organisms with those found in self proteins of the host. The intriguing concept of molecular mimicry has evolved substantially since its introduction over 20 years ago. We will summarize the most important developments and discuss puzzling questions, which remain open despite many claims that molecular mimicry is involved in the development of human autoimmune disease after infections or vaccinations.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
633;7599959;A Ca2+/calmodulin kinase inhibitor, KN-62, inhibits neurite outgrowth stimulated by CAMs and FGF.;We have used monolayers of parental 3T3 fibroblasts and 3T3 cells expressing transfected cell adhesion molecules (CAMs, NCAM, N-cadherin, or L1) as a culture substrate for cerebellar neurons. Previous studies suggest that the transfected CAMs promote neurite outgrowth by activating a second messenger pathway within the responding neuron that involves influx of calcium into neurons as a consequence of activation of an FGF receptor. The same neurite outgrowth response can be induced by FGF or a number of agents that directly activate defined steps in the CAM signaling pathway. In the present study we show that the neurite outgrowth stimulated by the above three CAMs, FGF, arachidonic acid (AA), and K+ depolarization can be abolished by the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent (CaM) kinase inhibitor, KN-62. We also demonstrate that neurite outgrowth over astrocytes, which represent a more physiologically relevant cellular substrate, can be substantially inhibited by a number of agents that block the CAM signaling pathway, including KN-62. However, neurite outgrowth induced by activation of protein kinase A is unaffected by inhibition of CaM kinase activity as is basal neurite outgrowth over 3T3 monolayers or a polylysine/laminin substrate. These results suggest that CaM kinase activity is specifically required downstream of calcium influx in the CAM and FGF signaling pathway leading to axonal growth. ;polylysine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
636;35940;Influence of the isolation procedure on the structure, neuraminidase and heamagglutinating activities of Sendai virus envelope glycoproteins.;The influence of the isolation procedure of Sendai virus glycoproteins from the virus surface on their neuraminidase and haemagglutinating activities, as well as on some structural properties was studied. These glycoproteins exhibited lower specific neuraminidase and haemagglutinating activities than those of intact virus. Neuraminidase activity was expressed when the glycoproteins were constituted in forms with molecular weights of about 70,000 (monomer), 160,000 (dimer), 300,000 (tetramer) or 600,000 (octamer), whereas haemagglutinating activity was only found for the glycoproteins aggregated in a high mol. wt. (approximately 10(6) daltons) form. The isolated glycoproteins contained two subunits revealed by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and three distinct antigenic components revealed by rocket immunoelectrophoresis. Different treatments of the glycoproteins after their isolation altered their structure. Consequently either neuraminidase and haemagglutinating activities were signicantly reduced, or one of these activities was not expressed.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3

All solutions were highly pseudoplastic . Solutions containing 0.3-0.5% of the gum exhibited a highly ordered phase at very low shear. Viscosity, the degree of pseudoplasticity , and the value of the transition from soft gel to pseudoplastic behavior were directly related to gum concentration. The effect of the addition of a salt on viscosity depended on the xanthan gum concentration. The viscosity of a 0.3% xanthan gum solution was practically unaffected by the salts. Higher gum concentrations exhibited a viscosity increase when salt was present. Concentrations less than 0.3% exhibited a viscosity decrease in the presence of a salt. All viscosity effects seemed to reach limiting values at approximately 10(-3) to 3.3 X 10(-3) N salt.

639;23737;Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase of Anabaena sp. Kinetic and molecular properties.;"The kinetic and molecular properties of cyanobacterial glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, partly purified from Anabaena sp. ATCC 27893, show that it undergoes relatively slow, reversible transitions between different aggregation states which differ in catalytic activity. Sucrose gradient centrifugation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reveal three pincipal forms, with approximate molecular weights of 120 000 (M1), 240 000 (M2) and 345 000 (M3). The relative catalytic activities are: M1 less than M2 less than M3. In concentrated solutions of the enzyme, the equilibrium favors the more active, oligomeric forms. Dilution in the absence of effectors shifts the equilibrium in favor of the M1 form, with a marked diminution of catalytic activity. This transition is prevented by a substrate, glucose-6-phosphate, and also by glutamine. The other substrate, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+), and (in crude cell-free extracts) ribulose-1,5-diphosphate are negative effectors, which tend to maintain the enzyme in the M1 form. The equilibrium state between different forms of the enzyme is also strongly dependent on hydrogen ion concentration. Although the optimal pH for catalytic activity is 7.4, dissociation to the hypoactive M1 form is favored at pH values above 7; a pH of 6.5 is optimal for maintenance of the enzyme in the active state. Reduced nicotamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), inhibit catalytic activity, but do not significantly affect the equilibrium state. The relevance of these findings to the regulation of enzyme activity in vivo is discussed.";-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1

645;6197089;Reconstitution mechanism of nucleosome core particles mediated by poly(L-glutamic acid).;Poly(L-glutamic acid) has been reported to mediate in vitro nucleosome assembly (Stein, A., Whitlock, J.P., Jr. and Bina, M. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 76,5000-5004). To study the reaction mechanism, we have reconstituted nucleosome core particles from chicken erythrocyte core DNA and core histones in the presence of poly(L-glutamic acid) and analyzed the assembly products by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Poly(L-glutamic acid), which binds and forms a large complex with core histones, is replaced with core DNA in the reconstitution process. When histone-poly(L-glutamic acid) complex and core DNA are mixed with a histone:DNA ratio of 1.0, the yield of core particles increases by prolonged reconstitution time. Two phases with a distinct time range appear in the process. In the fast phase within 30 min, 60% of the DNA is involved in products containing histones: reconstituted core particles, a larger nucleoprotein complex and aggregation. In the second phase, the remaining DNA and the DNA in the aggregation decrease, and the core particles increase slowly. The yield of core particles is approx. 60% after 24 h. The slow phase is not observed by reconstitution with a histone:DNA ratio of 2.0 in the initial mixture. The reaction scheme of the assembly process derived from these data is given. Based on the in vitro reaction scheme, the possible role of in vivo 'nucleosome assembly factors' is also discussed.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1

The molecular weight of the native enzyme, estimated by gel permeation, was about 288 KDa, while sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis yielded a relative molecular mass of 48 KDa. The determination of the coenzyme content gave 4 mol of NAD+ and 2 mol of NADH per mol of enzyme. The isoelectric point of native SAHase was at pH 5.1. When assayed in the hydrolytic direction, the Km for S-adenosylhomocysteine and the Vmax of the enzyme for this substrate were 84 microM and 357 mumol/min/mg, respectively; in the synthetic direction, instead, the Km for adenosine and the corresponding Vmax value were 1.6 microM and 37 mumol/min/mg. Substrate analogs were tested for their ability to act as inhibitors and inactivators of the enzyme. Among these compounds, 9-beta-arabinofuranosyl adenine (Ara A) appeared as the most powerful competitive inhibitor (Ki = 18 microM) as well as the strongest time-dependent inactivator. The common feature of all the assayed analogs was the presence of the adenine ring in their molecular structure. It can thus concluded that the presence of the adenine moiety is an essential element in substrate and/or inhibitor interaction with this bacterial enzyme.";-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1

Fifteen males and nine females participated voluntarily in the study and performed a swimming session at 75-80% of the maximal capacity. In basal conditions females presented higher lymphocyte MnSOD activity compared to males (p<0.05). Exercise increased MnSOD activity in males (p<0.05) reaching similar values to females. MnSOD gene expression was also increased in males after exercise (p<0.05) but not in females. Nitrite concentration and iNOS gene expression significantly increased only in males after swimming (p<0.01). The exercise decreased UCP-3 gene expression in both genders (p<0.05). Lymphocyte H(2)O(2) production significantly increased in males after exercise in non-stimulated and in PMA-stimulated cells (p<0.01). In conclusion, females seem to be more protected against oxidative stress induced by a swimming session.

The mixture of C. diphtheriae broth culture and 10 antitoxin units per ml was incubated for 1 hr at room temperature before it was added to the tissue cultures which were then incubated as long as 5 days; most results, however, were read in 72 hr. Elek's broth medium was superior to heart infusion broth for toxin production by C. diphtheriae. Addition of 20% rabbit serum improved toxin production in either broth. Numerous toxigenic and atoxigenic C. diphtheriae cultures were tested for toxigenicity in primary rabbit and monkey kidney tissue cultures. If properly controlled, this in vitro method appeared to have an advantage over the in vitro agar gel method; its results were comparable with the rabbit intradermal test. With the wider use of tissue cultures in most laboratories, we believe that the tissue culture method for toxigenicity would be more economical and easier to perform than the animal intradermal method.";-;-;-;hard_0
659;2844506;Release of growth hormone binding protein from IM-9 lymphocytes by endopeptidase is dependent on sulfhydryl group inactivation.;The hydrophilic GH-binding protein of serum is a derivative of the GH receptor. Little is known how this GH binding protein is released from the receptor which is firmly anchored in the plasma membrane. The IM-9 lymphocytes provide a useful laboratory model for studying this process because they are richly endowed with GH receptors and, under special conditions, are able to shed these receptors during incubation. Incubation of IM-9 cells for 90 min at 30 C did not result in the appearance of significant [125I]hGH binding in conditioned medium as determined with an ultrogel AcA 44 minicolumn. When iodoacetamide, 20 mM, or N-ethylmaleimide, 5 mM, was added during incubation, the conditioned medium bound 20-35% of [125I]human(h)GH. p-Chloromercuriphenyl sulfonic acid was less effective in promoting shedding of GH-binding protein. In contrast, aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF), bacitracin, leupeptin, pepstatin, phosphoramidon, or chloroquine did not promote release of GH binding protein and did not affect iodoacetamide-induced release. Release was not inhibited by the addition of serum lacking GH binding protein. GH binding protein release was markedly temperature sensitive and practically ceased at 4 C. GH binding protein incubated with [125I] hGH was cross-linked with disuccinimidyl suberate. After sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of dithiothreitol the complex migrated with an estimated molecular weight of 100,000 whereas [125I]hGH cross-linked to the membrane-bound GH receptor of the IM-9 cells migrated with an estimated molecular weight of 135,000. The smaller size of the binding protein is consistent with its derivation from the extracellular domain of the GH receptor. Because the release of this GH binding is greatly augmented by iodoacetamide and N-ethylmaleimide, two known sulfhydryl reactive reagents, we suggest that a free sulfhydryl group, either on the GH receptor or on a neighboring protein normally maintains the integrity of the receptor. The loss of this sulfhydryl group destabilizes the receptor and permits a membrane endopeptidase to release the GH binding protein. Cleavage is not dependent on lysosomal action and is not inhibited by protease inhibitors.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1

This segment of DNA specifies several regulatory elements and the amino-terminal portion of the early viral proteins. Comparisons with the analogous regions in the polyomaviruses simian virus 40 (SV40) and BK virus (BKV) confirm the close evolutionary relationship of these three viruses. Similarities include palindromic and symmetrical sequences near their origins of DNA replication, binding sites for their large T proteins, an AT-rich region (the Goldberg-Hogness, or TATA, box), and a large tandem duplication or triplication to the late side of their replication origins (however, these sequences differ). Homology between the sequences coding for the early proteins is also evident (79 and 93 of the first 110 amino acids are shared with SV40 and BKV, respectively). Of greater interest are features of the JCV genome which differ from those of other polyomaviruses. Absent in JCV and BKV are sequences which resemble the third T-antigen binding site of SV40. In addition, a set of sequences present in JCV and BKV DNAs (33 nucleotides in JCV and 22 nucleotides in BKV) and located near a 17-base-pair palindrome shared by all three viruses is missing in SV40 DNA. Another sequence, GGGXGGAG, which is repeated several times in many polyomaviruses and adenoviruses and which is thought to play a role in DNA replication or transcription or both, is not found near the JCV origin of replication.

664;451509;[Value and limits of urinary protein electrophoresis with sodium dodecyl sulfate in the evaluation of glomerular nephropathies].;Qualitative analysis of urinary proteins is contrasted with histological findings of 45 renal biopsies performed in patients with chronic glomerulonephritis. Compared to electrophoresis on cellulose acetate and immunoelectrophoresis, a method using polyacrylamide gel after sodium dodecylsulfate treatment makes for more refined and objective differentiation of protein abnormalities. On the whole, proteinuria of the selective glomerular or physiological type predominates in the event of minimal change or membranous lesions. The non-selective type is found more frequently with diffuse proliferative or membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (p less than 0.025). There are, however, too many exceptions to this rule to allow certainty, and a precise diagnosis of the particular type of glomerulonephritis is thus only possible histologically. Each type of histological involvement may cause almost any of the qualitative abnormalities of proteinuria. On the other hand, qualitative analysis of urinary proteins is useful for the detection of glomerulonephritis. A glomerular type of proteinuria may sometimes reveal involvement of kidneys at a time when, quantitatively, there is no proteinuria. In cases of orthostatic proteinuria a persistent glomerular type of tracing in recumbency suggests an organic kidney ailment. All patients in this series had a glomerular type of proteinuria when excretion was pathological, thus allowing a distinction from pure tubular involvement. 10 patients of the group, however, although they clearly had glomerular lesions (3 were diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis) showed perfectly normal proteinuria both quantitatively and qualitatively. This was the case in systemic lupus erythematosus where kidney biopsy was performed without clinical suspicion of renal involvement. In summary, qualitative abnormalities of proteinuria call attention to underlying glomerulonephritis, although no distinction can be made between the various forms and there may be no detectable abnormality even in the event of major kidney involvement.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1

Studying the phosphorylation-related inhibition of the NTPase, we found that phosphorylation of one polypeptide of rat liver envelopes by endogenous NI- and NII-like protein kinase was particularly sensitive to poly(A). This polypeptide (106 kDa) was also phosphorylated by nuclear-envelope-bound Ca2+-activated and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C). Activation of kinase C by tumour-promoting phorbol esters resulted in inhibition of nuclear-envelope NTPase activity and in a concomitant decrease of mRNA (actin) efflux rate from isolated rat liver nuclei. Protein kinase C, but not nuclear envelope NI-like or NII-like protein kinase, was found to be solubilized from the envelope by Triton X-100, whereas the presumable poly(A)-binding site [the 106 kDa polypeptide, representing the putative carrier for poly(A)+mRNA transport] remained bound to this structure. RNA efflux from detergent-treated nuclei lost its susceptibility to phorbol esters. Addition of purified protein kinase C to these nuclei restored the effect of the tumour promoters. Protein kinase C was found to bind also to isolated rat liver nuclear matrices in the absence but not in the presence of ATP.

This isochorismate synthase (MenF) is distinct from the entC-encoded isochorismate synthase (EntC) involved in enterobactin biosynthesis. MenF has been overexpressed under the influence of the T7 promoter and purified to homogeneity. The purified protein was found to have a molecular mass of 98 kDa as determined by gel filtration column chromatography on Sephacryl S-200. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a molecular mass of 48 kDa. Thus, the enzyme is a homodimer. The purified enzyme showed a pH optimum of 7.5 to 8.0 and a temperature optimum of 37 degrees C. The enzyme carries out the irreversible conversion of chorismate to isochorismate in the presence of Mg2+. The enzyme was found to have a Km of 195 +/- 23 microM and a k(cat) of 80 min(-1).

Both recipients' isolates were HSV-2 by restriction mapping and each donor had antibodies directed specifically against HSV-2, as determined by differential neutralization (HSV-2/HSV-1 ratios 1.46 and 1.58, where greater than 0.85 indicates antibody to HSV-2). Posttransplant, each recipient developed an antibody response with temporal antigenic specificity and complement-enhanced neutralization consistent with primary infection.

680;2243390;The arginine-rich domain of hepatitis B virus precore and core proteins contains a signal for nuclear transport.;Precore and core proteins are two related co-carboxy-terminal proteins of hepatitis B virus. Precore protein contains the entire sequence of core protein plus an amino-terminal extension of 29 amino acid residues. Both proteins can display a common antigenic determinant known as core antigen (HBcAg). Clinically, HBcAg is detected in the nucleus, cytoplasm, or both of hepatitis B virus-infected hepatocytes. In order to understand the mechanism that regulates nuclear transport of HBcAg, various portions of precore and core proteins were linked to a reporter protein, human alpha-globin, and expressed in mammalian cells. Our results indicate that the precore protein-specific sequence, although important for nuclear transport, does not contain a nuclear localization signal. Instead, a signal for nuclear transport is located near the carboxy termini of precore and core proteins in the arginine-rich domain. This signal is made up of a set of two direct PRRRRSQS repeats and is highly conserved among mammalian hepadnaviruses.;polyarginine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
681;1443343;Diagnosis of Encephalitozoon cuniculi infection by western blot and the use of cross-reactive antigens for the possible detection of microsporidiosis in humans.;Microsporidia are very primitive, eukaryotic, obligate, intracellular, protozoan parasites. Encephalitozoon cuniculi, a microsporidian originally described from a rabbit infection, has been described in humans as well as in many species of laboratory animals. We report the detection of E. cuniculi by Western blotting in a rabbit with torticollis that was obtained from an Encephalitozoon-free colony. Cross-reactivity of this serum was observed with antigens prepared from several genera of microsporidia. Identical Western blotting patterns were obtained with sera obtained from a rabbit immunized with E. cuniculi that was purified from tissue culture cells. In addition, we were able to demonstrate cross-reactivity between E. cuniculi rabbit antisera and Enterocytozoon bieneusi antigens by indirect immunofluorescent assay techniques in human intestinal biopsy samples. These cross-reactions between microsporidia may be useful in developing diagnostic tests for non-cultivatable microsporidia such as Enterocytozoon bieneusi.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
682;7911969;Expression and translocation of the chlamydial major outer membrane protein in Escherichia coli.;The entire gene encoding the major outer membrane protein (MOMP) from Chlamydia psittaci strain GPIC has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. A tightly regulated T7 promoter is used to control expression of the protein in Escherichia coli. Upon induction of expression, the precursor (pre-MOMP) is synthesized in the cell. This is followed by the appearance of a lower molecular weight protein that comigrates with mature MOMP from chlamydial elementary bodies by both one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. When E. coli cells expressing MOMP are converted to spheroplasts and subjected to protease treatment, MOMP is quantitatively degraded while cytoplasmic pre-MOMP is protected from degradation. Whole cells subjected to the same protease treatment show no degradation of MOMP. Furthermore, MOMP is not detected in surface-labeling experiments using several MOMP-specific antibodies. These data indicate that pre-MOMP is translocated to the periplasmic space and processed but is not surface exposed in E. coli. Expression of MOMP in this system causes a significant reduction in cell viability. In addition, coexpression in E. coli of MOMP or a MOMP-PhoA fusion with various chaperone proteins does not alter the level of MOMP translocation.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
684;870034;Estrogen photoaffinity labels. 2. Reversible binding and covalent attachment of photosensitive hexestrol derivatives to the uterine estrogen receptor.;"The ability of two radiolabeled, photoreactive estrogen analogues, [3H]hexestrol diazoketopropyl ether ([3H]Hex-DKP) and [3H]hexestrol azide ([3H]Hex-N3), to covalently label the uterine estrogen receptor is studied. Lamb uterine estrogen receptor preparations that have been partially purified (ammonium sulfate precipitation, Sephadex G-200 chromatography) and disaggregated by limited trypsinization can be electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels under conditions where binding activity is preserved. This electrophoretic procedure was used to fractionate the proteins labeled by the two photoreactive estrogen analogues. Prior to photolysis, peaks of radioactivity indicating estrogen specific binding of [3H]-Hex-N3 and [3H]Hex-DKP are evident on the gels, although dissociation of the latter compound is extensive. When preparations of uterine estrogen receptor that contain the photoreactive derivatives are irradiated and then electrophoresed, reversibly labeled proteins can be distinguished from irreversibly labeled ones (covalently bonded), by extraction of the individual gel slices with organic solvents. While no irreversible binding to receptor appears to result from irradiation with [3H]Hex-DKP, irradiation with [3H]Hex-N3 does covalently label the estrogen receptor. The receptor covalently labeled with [3H]Hex-N3 has the same electrophoretic mobility as the unlabeled receptor; the covalent labeling process is estrogen-site specific, and the efficiency of labeling (15-20%) is consistent with the inactivation efficiency of Hex-N3, previously measured by an indirect assay. This is the first example of the labeling of a steroid hormone receptor by photoaffinity labeling.";-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
687;14715739;Expression and immunogenicity of proteins encoded by sequences specific to Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis.;The development of immunoassays specific for the diagnosis of Johne's disease in cattle requires antigens specific to Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis. However, because of genetic similarity to other mycobacteria comprising the M. avium complex, no such antigens have been found. Through a comparative genomics approach, 21 potential coding sequences of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis that are not represented in any other mycobacterial species tested (n = 9) were previously identified (J. P. Bannantine, E. Baechler, Q. Zhang, L. Li, and V. Kapur, J. Clin. Microbiol. 40:1303-1310, 2002). Here we describe the cloning, heterologous expression, and antigenic analysis of these M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-specific sequences in Escherichia coli. Nucleotide sequences representing each unique predicted coding region were amplified and cloned into two different E. coli expression vectors encoding polyhistidine or maltose binding protein (MBP) affinity purification tags. All 21 of the MBP fusion proteins were successfully purified under denaturing conditions and were evaluated in immunoblotting studies with sera from rabbits and mice immunized with M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis. These studies showed that 5 of the 21 gene products are produced by M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis and are antigenic. Immunoblot analysis with a panel of sera from 9 healthy cattle and 10 cattle with clinical disease shows that the same five M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis proteins are also detected within the context of infection. Collectively, these studies have used a genomic approach to identify novel M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis antigens that are not present in any other mycobacteria. These findings may have a major impact on improved diagnostics for Johne's disease. ;polyhistidine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
690;17346312;Specific interaction of HeLa cell proteins with coxsackievirus B3 3'UTR: La autoantigen binds the 3' and 5'UTR independently of the poly(A) tail.;Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is a positive, single-stranded RNA virus. The secondary structure of the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of CVB3 RNA consists of three stem-loops and is followed by a poly(A) tail sequence. These stem-loop structures have been suggested to participate in the regulation of viral replication through interaction with cellular proteins that are yet to be identified. In this study, by competitive UV cross-linking using mutated 3'UTR probes we have demonstrated that the poly(A) tail is essential for promoting HeLa cell protein interactions with the 3'UTR because deletion of this sequence abolished most of the protein interactions. Unexpectedly, mutations that disrupted the tertiary loop-loop interactions without affecting the stem-loops did not apparently affect these protein interactions, indicating that secondary structure rather than the high-order structure may play a major role in recruiting these RNA binding proteins. Among the observed 3'UTR RNA binding proteins, we have confirmed a 52 kDa protein as the human La autoantigen by using purified recombinant protein and a polyclonal La antibody. This protein can interact with both the 3' and 5'UTRs independently of the poly(A) tail. Further analysis by two-stage UV cross-linking, we found that the 3' and 5'UTR sequences may share the same binding site on the La protein. ;polyalanine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

Fimbriae were purified by acid precipitation and preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. No hemagglutinating activity of purified fimbriae was found when the fimbriae were tested with several types of erythrocytes. The fimbrial protein subunit had a relative molecular mass of 17 kDa; an isoelectric point was found at pH 4.1. Analysis of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the fimbrial subunit indicated that X. c. pv. hyacinthi expresses type 4 fimbriae. A polyclonal rabbit antiserum was raised against the purified fimbriae. This antiserum recognized fimbriae of X. c. pv. hyacinthi in immunogold electron microscopy and immunoblotting experiments.

694;1744087;The complete sequence of perlecan, a basement membrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan, reveals extensive similarity with laminin A chain, low density lipoprotein-receptor, and the neural cell adhesion molecule.;"A heparan sulfate proteoglycan is a component of all basement membranes. This molecule consists of three heparan sulfate side chains linked to a large core protein of approximately 400 kDa. We have isolated seven overlapping murine cDNA clones that encode the entire mRNA sequence of 12.685 kilobases of this molecule. This sequence has a single open reading frame of 3,707 amino acids that encodes for a protein of 396 kDa. Identical or near identical matchups with nine peptide sequences derived from the core protein of the molecule isolated from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor were found with the deduced sequence. Sequence analysis and data base comparison of the deduced sequence show the protein to consist of five different domains, most of which contain internal repeats. Domain I contains a start methionine followed by a typical signal transfer sequence and a unique segment of 172 amino acids that contains the three probable sites of heparan sulfate attachment, SGD. Domain II contains four cysteine- and acidic amino acid-rich repeats that are very similar to those found in the LDL receptor and proteins such as GP330. Domain III consists of cysteine-rich and globular regions, both of which show similarity to those in the short arm of the laminin A chain. Domain IV contains 14 repeats of the immunoglobulin superfamily that are most highly similar to the immunoglobulin-like repeats in the neural cell adhesion molecule. Domain V contains three repeats with similarity to the laminin A chain G domain that are separated by epidermal growth factor-like regions not found in the laminin A chain. As the primary structural data agree with the appearance of the molecule in the electron microscope as a series of globules separated by rods, or ""beads on a string,"" we have adopted the name perlecan for this molecule. The variety of domains in perlecan suggest multiple interactions with other molecules.";polycysteine;-;acid-rich;LCR_with_hard
696;11118210;Influenza A virus NS2 protein mediates vRNP nuclear export through NES-independent interaction with hCRM1.;For nuclear export of proteins, the formation of a ternary export complex composed of the export substrate, a cellular export factor and Ran-GTP is crucial. CRM1 is a cellular export factor for proteins containing leucine-rich nuclear export signals (NESs). Although the NES sequence is crucial for nuclear export, its exact role in the formation of the ternary export complex is controversial. Here we demonstrate an interaction between human CRM1 (hCRM1) and influenza A virus NS2 protein, which contains an NES motif in its N-terminal region. Replacement of the hydrophobic amino acids in the NES motif did not abolish NS2's interaction with hCRM1. Using our recently established systems for the generation of influenza virus or virus-like particles from cloned cDNAs, we found that NS2 is essential for nuclear export of influenza virus ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, and that alteration of the NS2-NES abrogated this event and influenza virus generation. These findings suggest that the NS2-NES is not crucial for the interaction of this protein with hCRM1, but is for the formation of the ternary export complex with Ran-GTP.; polyleucine ;-;-;LCR_without_function
701;735982;Frequency of sensitization to different pollen groups and results of specific immunotherapy.;Of all the diseases produced by the inhalation of allergens, it is perhaps pollinosis in which specific immunotherapy with pollen antigens is most indicated. For this reason, the present work studies the symptoms and the results of skin tests, before and after the completion of a correct and specific course of immunotherapy for three years. We selected 345 patients with a clear history of pollinosis, suffering from rhinitis (90.7%), conjunctivitis (71%), bronchial asthma (51%) and urticaria (4.3%). The most sensitizing pollens were those of grasses, which affected 97.68% of the patients, followed by flowers (70.14%), shrubs (59,13%) and trees (47.82%). Multiple pollen sensitizations were found in 88.2%, but only 27.24% were sensitive to grass pollens alone. After specific polyvalent treatment with aqueous extract a notable improvement was found in the results of the skin tests (73.8%) and in clinical symptoms (87%). On the other hand, we found a deterioration in the skin test results in 5.9% and a worsening of symptoms in 1.5%. These unfavourable results were probably due to the failure to include all sensitizing pollens in the immunotherapy extract. These results suggest to us that the only worthwhile treatment for pollinosis is immunotherapy based on a polyvalent and specific extract individually prepared, whether aqueous or depot type, according to the skin test results.;-;antigen;-;hard_2

705;3537556;Macrophage procoagulant factors--mediators of inflammatory and neoplastic tissue lesions.;Mononuclear phagocytes, a specialized cell lineage comprising bone-marrow precursors, blood monocytes and tissue macrophages, can interact with blood coagulation mechanisms with resulting thrombus formation or extravascular fibrin accumulation. Such procoagulant activity is usually activation dependent and requires interaction of the cells with immune or nonimmune stimuli. In the former case (e.g., alloantigens, soluble protein antigens) collaboration of mononuclear phagocytes with T lymphocytes is necessary and is mediated by cell-to-cell contact or lymphokines. Prototype of a direct acting stimulus is bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Mononuclear phagocyte procoagulant activity is expressed in the form of cell membrane-bound or released factors which display molecular heterogeneity. They include the initiator of the extrinsic clotting pathway, tissue factor, known clotting proteases such as factors V and VII, and novel proteolytic enzymes including prothrombinase and a factor X activator. Mononuclear phagocyte procoagulants are pathogenetically involved in generalized disorders with intravascular coagulation and thromboembolic phenomena. These disorders, exemplified by the Shwartzman reaction and possibly by paraneoplastic thromboembolism, are initiated by blood monocytes.

706;1715028;Physical and molecular genetic analysis of Qa-2 antigen expression: multiple factors controlling cell surface levels.;We have examined the surface expression of Qa-2 on lymphocyte subpopulations and on splenocytes from inbred mouse strains by a radioactive binding assay using purified anti-Qa-2 antibodies and antibody fragments (Fab). Quantitative measurements by Scatchard analysis revealed that spleen cells from Qa-2high mice express (4-5) x 10(4) Qa-2 molecules/cell, whereas T lymphocytes have as high as (7-8) x 10(4) molecules/cell. In addition, it was determined that B lymphocytes express (5-6) x 10(3) molecules on their cell surface. The Qa-2 levels on anti-CD3-activated T cells is 1.0 x 10(5) molecules/cell. Previous experiments have shown that the quantity of Qa-2 varies in a strain-specific fashion and may be classified into three groups: Qa-2high, Qa-2medium and Qa-2low. Our results indicated that Qa-2high strains express (4-5) x 10(4) Qa-2 molecules/cell, Qa-2medium strains (B6-K2, B10.A, A/J, BALB/c and DBA/2) express (1-1.7) x 10(4) molecules/cell, and Qa-2low strains (SWR/J and DBA/1) express no more than 6 x 10(3) molecules/cell. Detection of Q7 or Q9 mRNA by the polymerase chain reaction revealed that Qa-2high strains express two functional Qa-2 enconding genes, Q7 and Q9, whereas Qa-2medium and Qa-2low strains express either Q7 or Q9. These results strongly suggest that Qa-2 gene dosage contributes in part to the variation of Qa-2 levels on the cell surface.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
707;3785168;Purification of a cellular, double-stranded DNA-binding protein required for initiation of adenovirus DNA replication by using a rapid filter-binding assay.;A rapid and quantitative nitrocellulose filter-binding assay is described for the detection of nuclear factor I, a HeLa cell sequence-specific DNA-binding protein required for the initiation of adenovirus DNA replication. In this assay, the abundant nonspecific DNA-binding activity present in unfractionated HeLa nuclear extracts was greatly reduced by preincubation of these extracts with a homopolymeric competitor DNA. Subsequently, specific DNA-binding activity was detected as the preferential retention of a labeled 48-base-pair DNA fragment containing a functional nuclear factor I binding site compared with a control DNA fragment to which nuclear factor I did not bind specifically. This specific DNA-binding activity was shown to be both quantitative and time dependent. Furthermore, the conditions of this assay allowed footprinting of nuclear factor I in unfractionated HeLa nuclear extracts and quantitative detection of the protein during purification. Using unfrozen HeLa cells and reagents known to limit endogenous proteolysis, nuclear factor I was purified to near homogeneity from HeLa nuclear extracts by a combination of standard chromatography and specific DNA affinity chromatography. Over a 400-fold purification of nuclear factor I, on the basis of the specific activity of both sequence-specific DNA binding and complementation of adenovirus DNA replication in vitro, was affected by this purification. The most highly purified fraction was greatly enriched for a polypeptide of 160 kilodaltons on silver-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Furthermore, this protein cosedimented with specific DNA-binding activity on glycerol gradients. That this fraction indeed contained nuclear factor I was demonstrated by both DNase I footprinting and its function in the initiation of adenovirus DNA replication. Finally, the stoichiometry of specific DNA binding by nuclear factor I is shown to be most consistent with 2 mol of the 160-kilodalton polypeptide binding per mol of nuclear factor I-binding site.;-;nucleic acid binding;polyacrylamide;hard_3
709;8717418;Torsionally-strained DNA and intermolecular purine-purine-pyrimidine triple-helix formation.;A potentially powerful pharmacological approach to modulating the expression of specific, disease-related genes involves the inhibition of transcription factor binding to promoter or enhancer elements through oligonucleotide-mediated triple-helix formation. In vivo, the typical target for intermolecular triplex formation would most likely be torsionally-strained rather than relaxed duplex DNA. To determine the effects of strained DNA on triplex formation, we investigated the interactions between a G/T-rich oligonucleotide and both supercoiled and relaxed plasmid DNA using a restriction endonuclease protection assay. Both the kinetics of formation and dissociation of purine-motif triplexes were unaffected by the conformational state of the duplex DNA. Similarly, the topological state of the plasmid targets was not affected by triplex formation. Taken together, these observations suggest that stable intermolecular triplexes can form in vivo under conditions of moderate torsional strain. ;-;helix;polynucleotide;hard_3

First, oligonucleotides yielding a specific 137-base-pair (bp) fragment from eucaryotic DNA amplified from a highly conserved region of the 18-S ribosomal gene was used to assess DNA quality. Second, the presence of pork DNA was determined with specific oligonucleotides yielding a 108-bp fragment amplified from the porcine growth hormone gene.

713;9092567;A GT-rich sequence binding the transcription factor Sp1 is crucial for high expression of the human type VII collagen gene (COL7A1) in fibroblasts and keratinocytes.;Type VII collagen is the major component of anchoring fibrils, structural elements that stabilize the attachment of the basement membrane to the underlying dermis. In this study, we have dissected the human type VII collagen gene (COL7A1) promoter to characterize the cis-elements responsible for the expression of the gene in cultured fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Using transient cell transfections with various 5' end deletion COL7A1 promoter/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene plasmid constructs, we determined that the region between nucleotides -524 and -456, relative to the transcription start site, is critical for high promoter activity in both cell types studied. Gel mobility shift assays using several DNA fragments spanning this region identified a GT-rich sequence between residues -512 and -505, necessary for the binding of nuclear proteins to this region of the promoter. Point mutations abolished the binding of nuclear proteins in gel shift assays and drastically diminished the activity of the promoter in transient cell transfections. Supershift assays with antibodies against various transcription factors including Sp1, Sp3, c-Jun/AP-1, and AP-2, and competition experiments with oligonucleotides containing consensus sequences for Sp1 and AP-1 binding identified Sp1 as the transcription factor binding to this region of the COL7A1 promoter. Indeed, recombinant human Sp1 was shown to bind the COL7A1 promoter GT-rich element but not its mutated form in gel mobility shift assays. In addition, co-transfection of pPacSp1, an expression vector for Sp1, together with the COL7A1 promoter/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct into Sp1-deficient Drosophila Schneider SL2 cells unequivocally demonstrated that Sp1 is essential for high expression of the COL7A1 gene. These data represent the first in-depth analysis of the human COL7A1 promoter transcriptional control.;-;transcription factor;polynucleotide;hard_3

To obtain an insight into underlying molecular mechanisms, we addressed gene expression profiles of NA8 melanoma cells cultured in bidimensional monolayers (2D) or in 3D multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS). MCTS containing 10-30,000 cells were generated upon overnight culture in poly-Hydroxyethylmethacrylate (polyHEMA) coated plates. Kinetics of cell proliferation in MCTS was significantly slower than in monolayer cultures. Following long-term culture (>10 days), however, MCTS showed highly compact and organised cell growth in outer layers, with necrotic cores. Oligonucleotide microarray analysis of the expression of over 20,000 genes was performed on cells cultured in standard 2D, in the presence of collagen as model of extracellular matrix (ECM), or in MCTS. Gene expression profiles of cells cultured in 2D in the presence or absence of ECM were highly similar, with >/=threefold differences limited to five genes. In contrast, culture in MCTS resulted in the significant, >/=threefold, upregulation of the expression of >100 transcripts while 73 were >/=threefold downregulated. In particular, genes encoding CXCL1, 2, and 3 (GRO-alpha, -beta, and gamma), IL-8, CCL20 (MIP-3alpha), and Angiopoietin-like 4 were significantly upregulated, whereas basic FGF and CD49d encoding genes were significantly downregulated. Oligonucleotide chip data were validated at the gene and protein level by quantitative real-time PCR, ELISA, and cell surface staining assays. Taken together, our data indicate that structural modifications of the architecture of tumor cell cultures result in a significant upregulation of the expression of a number of genes previously shown to play a role in melanoma progression and metastatic process.;-;-;polynucleotide;hard_1
716;3331218;Inhibition of in vitro splicing of a mouse insulin pre-mRNA by covalent cross-links in the intron region.;Recent studies have indicated that in vitro splicing of a mouse insulin pre-mRNA by a HeLa cell nuclear extract is accompanied by the unwinding of substrate RNA. The present experiments were performed to determine whether this melting of the secondary structure of the precursor RNA is essential for the splicing reaction. 32P-labelled mouse insulin pre-mRNA synthesized in vitro in a SP6 transcription system was cross-linked with aminomethyltrimethyl psoralen and fractionated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. RNA species containing different intramolecular cross-links were eluted from the gel and the sites of cross-links were mapped by primer extension analysis using synthetic oligonucleotide primers. Under conditions that allow accurate in vitro splicing of intact pre-mRNA, precursor molecules with psoralen cross-links within their intron region were not spliced by a HeLa cell nuclear extract. This observation strongly supports the assumption that unwinding of precursor RNA molecules is necessary for the splicing reaction.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1

In order to clarify the therapeutic potential of telomerase inhibitors we examined different substances (small molecule compounds BIBR1532 and BRACO19, as well as hTR antisense oligonucleotides 2'-O-methyl RNA and PNA) in A-549, MCF-7, and Calu-3 cell lines in a cell-free TRAP assay. We demonstrated that each of the tested agents inhibited telomerase in all used cell lines and that the antisense oligonucleotides represent the most potent inhibitors. Interestingly, upon evaluating the specificity of telomerase inhibitors we found out that not all agents acted specifically against telomerase. We observed that BRACO19 and PNA had an inhibitory effect also on PCR amplification of the TSR8 oligonucleotide which is provided in the TRAP(EZE) kit as a PCR control. By modifying the experimental protocol and using a different reverse primer we were able to enhance PNA selectivity, although the PCR inhibition of the TSR8 control template by BRACO19 could not be prevented. We propose an explanation for the lack of target specificity and suggest caution when testing putative telomerase inhibitors, as it appears that some of those substances may not affect specifically telomerase or telomeric G-rich sequences and thus can lead to the misinterpretation of experimental results.;-;-;polynucleotide;hard_1

They modulate the translational efficiency of target mRNAs through base-pairing with the help of RNA chaperone Hfq. The present study identified a novel sRNA, Esr41 (enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157 small RNA #41), from an intergenic region of an enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) O157:H7 Sakai-specific sequence that is not present in the nonpathogenic E. coli K-12. Esr41 was detected as an RNA molecule approximately 70 nucleotides long with a 3' GC-rich palindrome sequence followed by a long poly(U), which is a characteristic of rho-independent terminators and is also a structural feature required for the action of Hfq. EHEC O157 harboring a multicopy plasmid carrying the esr41 gene increased cell motility and the expression of fliC, a gene encoding a major flagellar component. These results indicate that Esr41 stimulates fliC expression in EHEC O157. Furthermore, the increase in cell motility induced by Esr41 was also observed in the E. coli K-12, suggesting that target genes controlled by Esr41 are present in both EHEC O157 and K-12.;-;-;polynucleotide;hard_1

Decreasing the protein amount results in a mixture of free oligonucleotides and DNA molecules occupied by two WT-PhoB(DBD). Moreover, the SPR results indicate that both binding site segments, the TGTCA-motif and the A/T-rich minor groove, are essential for the binding process. A comparison of different regulons additionally proved the dependency of the recognition process on the base composition of the minor groove. ;-;transcription factor;polynucleotide;hard_3
728;1961709;A triplex DNA-binding protein from human cells: purification and characterization.;A protein that binds to an oligonucleotide triplex, (dT)34.(dA)34.(dT)34 (TAT triplex), was purified from HeLa cells by a combination of conventional column chromatography and triplex DNA affinity chromatography. The protein has an apparent molecular mass of 55 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gels. Although the protein has an affinity for AT duplex and TAT triplex, a higher affinity for TAT triplex was demonstrated by comparing the elution profiles from an AT duplex and a TAT triplex affinity column. The protein has a moderate affinity for poly(dA-dG).poly(dT-dC) and a very low affinity for single-strand (dA)34 or (dT)34 and various sources of duplex DNA including poly(dA-dT).poly(dA-dT). The possible biological function of this triplex DNA-binding protein is discussed.;-;nucleic acid binding;polyacrylamide;hard_3
731;6996729;A circular dichroism study of Escherichia coli Initiation Factor-1 binding to polynucleotides.;Binding of Escherichia coli Initiation Factor-1 protein to the nucleic acid lattice induces alterations in the secondary structures of a variety of purine and pyrimidine containing polynucleotides in both the single and double stranded conformations, as assessed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. The helical hairpin form of poly(U), the single-stranded stacked form of poly(C), and the duplex poly(A) x poly(U) (in the presence of Mg2+) are stoichiometrically converted by Initiation Factor-1 (IF-1) to structures spectrally indistinguishable from their partially or completely thermally denatured forms. By contrast, the binding of IF-1 to double stranded poly(C), single- and double-stranded poly(A) elicited spectral responses which were interpreted in terms of diminished base-base interaction, not equivalent to that induced by thermal means. Stoichiometric endpoints of 3-5 nucleotide residues/IF-1 were determined for polynucleotide structures in those cases where light scattering artifacts at low nucleotide residue to protein ratios were absent. In the absence of Mg2+ IF-1 was unable to elicit a conformation alteration effect in poly(A) x poly(U), while for poly(U) much less of an effect was observed than in the presence of this divalent ion. The functional significance of these results is briefly considered.;-;-;polynucleotide;hard_1
732;7011814;On the role of ribosylthymine in prokaryotic tRNA function.;tRNAPhe and tRNALys were isolated from an Escherichia coli K12 mutant deficient in ribosylthymine (rT) and from the wild-type strain. The sequence G-rT-psi-C which is common to loop IV of practically all tRNAs used in the elongation cycle of protein synthesis reads G-U-psi-C in the tRNAs of the mutant strain. The purified tRNAs were compared in various steps of protein biosynthesis. The poly(U)-dependent poly(Phe) synthesis performed with purified Phe-tRNAPhe and purified elongation factors showed no dependence on the presence or absence of ribosylthymine in the respective tRNAs. In contrast, the corresponding poly(A)-dependent poly(Lys) synthesis was markedly increased when Lys-tRNALys lacking rT was used. The analysis of individual functional steps of the poly(A)-dependent elongation cycle demonstrated that the absence of rT reduced the binding to the A-site and improved the translocation reaction, whereas the formation of the ternary complex EF-Tu . GTP . aa-tRNA as well as both tRNA binding to the P-site and the peptidyltransferase reaction remained unaffected. The presence of U in place of rT in tRNA increases the misincorporation of leucine in an optimized poly(U)/poly(Phe) system from about 3 in 10 000 to 3 in 1000. Our results are in agreement with the view that rT is involved in tRNA binding to the A-site in contrast to the P-site, and suggested that the presence of rT in tRNA improves the fidelity of the decoding process at the A-site of the ribosome. ;-;nucleic acid binding;polynucleotide;hard_3
734;14529286;DNA sequence recognition by bispyrazinonaphthalimides antitumor agents.;Bifunctional DNA intercalating agents have long attracted considerable attention as anticancer agents. One of the lead compounds in this category is the dimeric antitumor drug elinafide, composed of two tricyclic naphthalimide chromophores separated by an aminoalkyl linker chain optimally designed to permit bisintercalation of the drug into DNA. In an effort to optimize the DNA recognition capacity, different series of elinafide analogues have been prepared by extending the surface of the planar drug chromophore which is important for DNA sequence recognition. We report here a detailed investigation of the DNA sequence preference of three tetracyclic monomeric or dimeric pyrazinonaphthalimide derivatives. Melting temperature measurements and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies indicate that the dimerization of the tetracyclic planar chromophore considerably augments the affinity of the drug for DNA, polynucleotides, or hairpin oligonucleotides and promotes selective interaction with G.C sites. The (CH(2))(2)NH(CH(2))(3)NH(CH(2))(2) connector stabilizes the drug-DNA complexes. The methylation of the two nitrogen atoms of this linker chain reduces the binding affinity and increases the dissociation rates of the drug-DNA complexes by a factor of 10. DNase I footprinting experiments were used to investigate the sequence selectivity of the drugs, demonstrating highly preferential binding to G.C-rich sequences. It also served to select a high-affinity site encompassing the sequence 5'-GACGGCCAG which was then introduced into a biotin-labeled hairpin oligonucleotide to accurately measure the binding parameters by SPR. The affinity constant of the unmethylated dimer for this sequence is 500 times higher than that of the monomer compound and approximately 10 times higher than that of the methylated dimer. The DNA groove accessibility was also probed with three related oligonucleotides carrying G --> c(7)G, G --> I, and C --> M substitutions. The level of drug binding to the two hairpin oligonucleotides containing 7-deazaguanine (c(7)G) or 5-methylcytosine (M) residues is unchanged or only slightly reduced compared to that of the unmodified target. In contrast, incorporation of inosine (I) residues considerably decreases the extent of drug binding or even abolishes the interaction as is the case with the monomer. The pyrazinonaphthalimide derivatives are thus much more sensitive to the deletion of the exocyclic guanine 2-amino group exposed in the minor groove of the duplex than to the modification of the major groove elements. The complementary SPR footprinting methodology combining site selection and quantitative DNA affinity analysis constitutes a reliable method for dissecting the DNA sequence selectivity profile of reversible DNA binding small molecules. ;-;nucleic acid binding;polynucleotide;hard_3
