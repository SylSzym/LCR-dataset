2444647;A Yersinia pseudotuberculosis protein which cross-reacts with HLA-B27.;The most-debated question in the investigation of the spondyloarthropathies has been whether there is molecular mimicry between host HLA-B27 antigens and the arthritis-causing pathogens. We have generated a monoclonal anti-HLA-B27 antibody in our laboratory and have used a radioimmunoassay to screen a panel of bacterial species. Two strains of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis were found to be highly reactive. The cross-reactive Yersinia component was identified by Western blot to be a 19,000 component. A preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis chromatography apparatus was constructed to isolate milligram quantities of this component. To verify that the component carried the HLA-B27-specific epitope, rabbits were hyperimmunized with the purified materials. Affinity-purified antibodies from one of the immunized rabbits indeed carried anti-HLA-B27 activity. Last, antibodies generated against synthetic peptides derived from the HLA-B27.1 amino acid sequence were tested against the Yersinia component. Positive reactivity was found with antibodies generated against a peptide spanning residues 69-83 of the HLA-B27.1 protein. Since this resides in the segment responsible for the allotypic specificity of the antigen, these experiments establish the presence of molecular mimicry to a high degree of confidence.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
11231015;Intermolecular interactions between the SH3 domain and the proline-rich TH region of Bruton's tyrosine kinase.;The SH3 domain of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) is preceded by the Tec homology (TH) region containing proline-rich sequences. We have studied a protein fragment containing both the Btk SH3 domain and the proline-rich sequences of the TH region (PRR-SH3). Intermolecular NMR cross-relaxation measurements, gel permeation chromatography profiles, titrations with proline-rich peptides, and (15)N NMR relaxation measurements are all consistent with a monomer-dimer equilibrium with a dissociation constant on the order of 60 microM. The intermolecular interactions do, at least in part, involve proline-rich sequences in the TH region. This behavior of Btk PRR-SH3 may have implications for the functional action of Btk.;proline;-;-;LCR_without_function
22561842;Cohort Profile: the National Prostate Cancer Register of Sweden and Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden 2.0.;In 1987, the first Regional Prostate Cancer Register was set up in the South-East health-care region of Sweden. Other health-care regions joined and since 1998 virtually all prostate cancer (PCa) cases are registered in the National Prostate Cancer Register (NPCR) of Sweden to provide data for quality assurance, bench marking and clinical research. NPCR includes data on tumour stage, Gleason score, serum level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and primary treatment. In 2008, the NPCR was linked to a number of other population-based registers by use of the personal identity number. This database named Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden (PCBaSe) has now been extended with more cases, longer follow-up and a selection of two control series of men free of PCa at the time of sampling, as well as information on brothers of men diagnosed with PCa, resulting in PCBaSe 2.0. This extension allows for studies with case-control, cohort or longitudinal case-only design on aetiological factors, pharmaceutical prescriptions and assessment of long-term outcomes. The NPCR covers >96% of all incident PCa cases registered by the Swedish Cancer Register, which has an underreporting of <3.7%. The NPCR is used to assess trends in incidence, treatment and outcome of men with PCa. Since the national registers linked to PCBaSe are complete, studies from PCBaSe 2.0 are truly population based.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
17653867;The Siva protein is a novel intracellular ligand of the CD4 receptor that promotes HIV-1 envelope-induced apoptosis in T-lymphoid cells.;In addition to its positive signaling function in the antigen presentation process, CD4 acts as the primary receptor for HIV-1. Contact between CD4 and the viral envelope leads to virus entry, but can also trigger apoptosis of uninfected CD4+ T-cells through a mechanism that is poorly understood. We show that Siva-1, a death domain-containing proapoptotic protein, associates with the cytoplasmic domain of CD4. This interaction is mediated by the cysteine-rich region found in the C-terminal part of the Siva-1 protein. Expression of Siva-1 specifically increases the susceptibility of both T-cell lines and unstimulated human primary CD4+ T-lymphocytes to CD4-mediated apoptosis triggered by the HIV-1 envelope, and results in activation of a caspase-dependent mitochondrial pathway. The same susceptibility is observed in T-cells expressing a truncated form of CD4 that is able to recruit Siva-1 but fails to associate with p56Lck, indicating that Siva-1 participates in a pathway independent of the p56Lck kinase activity. Altogether, these results suggest that Siva-1 might participate in the CD4-initiated signaling apoptotic pathway induced by the HIV-1 envelope in T-lymphoid cells. ;cysteine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
9314562;Vaccination with DNA encoding the immunodominant LACK parasite antigen confers protective immunity to mice infected with Leishmania major.;To determine whether DNA immunization could elicit protective immunity to Leishmania major in susceptible BALB/c mice, cDNA for the cloned Leishmania antigen LACK was inserted into a euykaryotic expression vector downstream to the cytomegalovirus promoter. Susceptible BALB/c mice were then vaccinated subcutaneously with LACK DNA and challenged with L. major promastigotes. We compared the protective efficacy of LACK DNA vaccination with that of recombinant LACK protein in the presence or absence of recombinant interleukin (rIL)-12 protein. Protection induced by LACK DNA was similar to that achieved by LACK protein and rIL-12, but superior to LACK protein without rIL-12. The immunity conferred by LACK DNA was durable insofar as mice challenged 5 wk after vaccination were still protected, and the infection was controlled for at least 20 wk after challenge. In addition, the ability of mice to control infection at sites distant to the site of vaccination suggests that systemic protection was achieved by LACK DNA vaccination. The control of disease progression and parasitic burden in mice vaccinated with LACK DNA was associated with enhancement of antigen-specific interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production. Moreover, both the enhancement of IFN-gamma production and the protective immune response induced by LACK DNA vaccination was IL-12 dependent. Unexpectedly, depletion of CD8(+) T cells at the time of vaccination or infection also abolished the protective response induced by LACK DNA vaccination, suggesting a role for CD8(+) T cells in DNA vaccine induced protection to L. major. Thus, DNA immunization may offer an attractive alternative vaccination strategy against intracellular pathogens, as compared with conventional vaccination with antigens combined with adjuvants.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
455447;Nearly precise excision: a new type of DNA alteration associated with the translocatable element Tn10.;"We describe an unusual DNA alteration, ""nearly precise excision,"" which has been identified among tetracycline-sensitive deletion derivatives of lambda phages carrying the translocatable tetracycline-resistance element Tn10. DNA sequence analysis of two such derivatives demonstrates that each retains exactly 50 bp of Tn10 material. The original junctions between lambda and Tn10 sequences remain intact; however, an internal deletion has occurred within Tn10 which eliminates all but the last few base pairs at each end of the element. This deletion occurs within a short A + T-rich inverted repeat which is present near each end of Tn10. Nearly precise excisions occur at frequencies comparable to Tn10-promoted deletions, inversions and translocations, and, like these other events, are independent of phage and bacterial functions for homologous recombination (recA, recB, red). It is not yet clear, however, whether nearly precise excisions are specifically promoted by Tn10 or whether they arise during the course of normal DNA replication processes as a consequence of unusual symmetries present in the DNA sequence at the ends of Tn10.";threonine;-;-;LCR_without_function
8069192;Neutrophils from patients with myelodysplastic syndromes: relationship between impairment of granular contents, complement receptors, functional activities and disease status.;Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are stem cell disorders of clonal origin in which infections and leukemic transformation are quite frequent. Neutrophils from 28 patients with MDS were analysed by flow cytometry for the expression of the two complement receptors CR1 and CR3, the antigenic reactivity of some granule constituents--myeloperoxidase, lysozyme, elastase, lactoferrin--and functional activities, such as locomotion, respiratory burst and cytotoxicity. The results were correlated with the FAB disease subtypes, grouped as low risk (RA) and high risk patients (RAEB, RAEB-t, CMML) and with 30 healthy subjects. A significant reduction in the percentage of neutrophil CR1, CR3 positivity and chemotaxis induced by endotoxin-activated serum was detected in the high risk group when compared with the low risk group and healthy controls. Furthermore, the high risk group also showed a low amount of myeloperoxidase, elastase, lysozyme and superoxide anion, but both low and high risk groups displayed reduced cellular cytotoxicity in comparison with the control. This work indicates that MDS patients belonging to the more advanced FAB categories frequently show multiple abnormalities in the expression of neutrophil complement receptors, and granular components (> 3), as well as in cell functions, suggesting the possibility of using these phenotypic abnormalities in the monitoring of disease progression.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
2902928;A tissue-specific transcription factor containing a homeodomain specifies a pituitary phenotype.;Multiple related cis-active elements required for cell-specific activation of the rat prolactin gene appear to bind a pituitary-specific positive transcription factor(s), referred to as Pit-1. DNA complementary to Pit-1 mRNA, cloned on the basis of specific binding to AT-rich cell-specific elements in the rat prolactin and growth hormone genes, encodes a 33 kd protein with significant similarity at its carboxyl terminus to the homeodomains encoded by Drosophila developmental genes. Pit-1 mRNA is expressed exclusively in the anterior pituitary gland in both somatotroph and lactotroph cell types, which produce growth hormone and prolactin, respectively. Pit-1 expression in heterologous cells (HeLa) selectively activates prolactin and growth hormone fusion gene expression, suggesting that Pit-1 is sufficient to confer a characteristic pituitary phenotype. The structure of Pit-1 and its recognition elements suggests that metazoan tissue phenotype is controlled by a family of transcription factors that bind to related cis-active elements and contain several highly conserved domains. ;threonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
1674817;"Mutations in the yeast RNA14 and RNA15 genes result in an abnormal mRNA decay rate; sequence analysis reveals an RNA-binding domain in the RNA15 protein.";In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, temperature-sensitive mutations in the genes RNA14 and RNA15 correlate with a reduction of mRNA stability and poly(A) tail length. Although mRNA transcription is not abolished in these mutants, the transcripts are rapidly deadenylated as in a strain carrying an RNA polymerase B(II) temperature-sensitive mutation. This suggests that the primary defect could be in the control of the poly(A) status of the mRNAs and that the fast decay rate may be due to the loss of this control. By complementation of their temperature-sensitive phenotype, we have cloned the wild-type genes. They are essential for cell viability and are unique in the haploid genome. The RNA14 gene, located on chromosome H, is transcribed as three mRNAs, one major and two minor, which are 2.2, 1.5, and 1.1 kb in length. The RNA15 gene gives rise to a single 1.2-kb transcript and maps to chromosome XVI. Sequence analysis indicates that RNA14 encodes a 636-amino-acid protein with a calculated molecular weight of 75,295. No homology was found between RNA14 and RNA15 or between RNA14 and other proteins contained in data banks. The RNA15 DNA sequence predicts a protein of 296 amino acids with a molecular weight of 32,770. Sequence comparison reveals an N-terminal putative RNA-binding domain in the RNA15-encoded protein, followed by a glutamine and asparagine stretch similar to the opa sequences. Both RNA14 and RNA15 wild-type genes, when cloned on a multicopy plasmid, are able to suppress the temperature-sensitive phenotype of strains bearing either the rna14 or the rna15 mutation, suggesting that the encoded proteins could interact with each other. ;alanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
2434596;Clonal analysis of primary B cells responsive to the pathogenic bacterium Salmonella typhimurium.;In the present study, a modification of the splenic focus system is used to analyze the S. typhimurium strain TML (TML)-specific B cell repertoire. The results show that the frequency of primary TML-specific splenic B cells in CBA/Ca mice is approximately 1 per 10(5) B cells and less than 30% of these B cells are specific for LPS. In contrast, the frequency of memory TML-specific cells is approximately 1 per 5-8 X 10(3) splenic B cells and greater than 95% of these B cells are specific for LPS. These results suggest that the frequency of primary TML-specific B cells is extremely low and that it expands 15-20-fold after antigen exposure. It is interesting that less than 30% of the primary B cells are specific for the LPS molecule since it is considered to be the major antigenic determinant on Salmonella organisms. Furthermore, the majority of the LPS-specific anti-TML antibody-producing clones are directed against the LPS O antigen region. Conversely, more than half to two-thirds of the memory LPS-specific anti-TML B cell clones are directed against the KDO or lipid A region of the LPS molecule. These results indicate that the preferential expansion of LPS-specific B cell clones observed after immunization resides primarily in the B cell subsets responsive to the KDO/lipid A moieties on the LPS molecule. Finally, unlike B cell responses to chemically defined antigens, TML stimulates very little IgG1 antibody. IgG2 and IgA isotypes appear to play a predominant role in anti-TML antibody responses, although all H chain classes are produced to some extent. Collectively, these findings are consistent with the responses reported for two other natural antigens, HA and PC. Hence, the pattern of stimulation by infectious agents, such as S. typhimurium, appears to be distinct from that of synthetic antigens. Thus, the studies presented herein have begun to provide insights into those subsets of B cells responsive to S. typhimurium and other infectious disease organisms.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
457654;Purified eukaryotic initiation factor 2 from calf liver consists of two polypeptide chains of 48,000 and 38,000 daltons.;Eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2), which specifically binds Met-tRNAMetf and forms stable ternary complexes with GTP, has been purified from ribosomal salt wash proteins from calf liver. The purified factor exhibits only two polypeptide bands of Mr = 48,000 and 38,000 following electrophoresis in 15% polyacrylamide gels in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Densitometric tracings show the two polypeptides are present in a molar ratio of 1:1. This suggests a Mr = 86,000 for the native enzyme, a value which agrees with the apparent molecular weight determined by physical methods. Less pure preparations of eIF-2 show additional polypeptide bands, including 50,000- and 46,000-dalton bands, all of which can be removed by further purification without affecting the activity of eIF-2.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
9792050;Genetic instability of microsatellite sequences in non-small cell lung cancers.;To evaluate the frequency and pattern of microsatellite instability in NSCLCs, we examined 36 cases of resected NSCLC. The mean age of the patients was 59.9+/-8.4 years. There were 19 cases of squamous cell carcinoma, 15 of adenocarcinoma and two of large cell carcinoma. We observed microsatellite instability at one or more loci in 13 (36%) of 36 tumors analyzed, and this instability ranged from six tumors showing instability in only a single microsatellite to three tumors that had alterations in three of four tested microsatellites. The microsatellite that showed instability most frequently in these tumors was D3S1340 (31%). Microsatellite instability was found in five (26%) of 19 squamous cell carcinomas, six (40%) of 15 adenocarcinomas, and in both large cell carcinomas tested. We found microsatellite instability in four (24%) of 17 cancers at stage I, in one (17%) of six at stage II, in eight (73%) of eleven at stage IIIa, and in neither at stage IIIb. In conclusion, microsatellite instability was noted in at least one third of non-small cell lung cancers, suggesting its possible role in cancer development.;-;-;-;hard_0
9015708;Lack of chondroitin sulphate epitope in the proliferating zone of the growth plate of chicken tibia.;Monoclonal antibodies specific to chondroitin sulphate (CS-56) and keratan sulphate (AH12) were used to localize proteoglycans in the proximal tibial articular cartilage and growth plate of broiler chickens. There was no CS-56 labelling in the proliferative zone of the growth plate. In contrast, intense labelling with this antibody was observed in the transitional and hypertrophic zones of the growth plate and the articular cartilage. This was confirmed by extracting chondroitin sulphate fractions from different zones of the growth plate and articular cartilage, and examining their antigenicities to CS-56 by ELISA inhibition assay. It was suggested that the maturation of chondrocytes in the growth plate is related to the production of chondroitin sulphate with CS-56 epitope, which may be a prerequisite for normal endochondral bone formation in the chicken tibia. The role of chondroitin sulphate recognized by CS-56 in the articular cartilage is unknown.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
10636916;The Smad4 activation domain (SAD) is a proline-rich, p300-dependent transcriptional activation domain.;Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family members signal through a unique set of intracellular proteins called Smads. Smad4, previously identified as the tumor suppressor DPC4, is functionally distinct among the Smad family, and is required for the assembly and transcriptional activation of diverse, Smad-DNA complexes. We previously identified a 48-amino acid proline-rich regulatory element within the middle linker domain of this molecule, the Smad4 activation domain (SAD), which is essential for mediating these signaling activities. We now characterize the functional activity of the SAD. Mutants lacking the SAD are still able to form complexes with other Smad family members and associated transcription factors, but cannot activate transcription in these complexes. Furthermore, the SAD itself is able to activate transcription in heterologous reporter assays, identifying it as a proline-rich transcriptional activation domain, and indicating that the SAD is both necessary and sufficient to activate Smad-dependent transcriptional responses. We show that transcriptional activation by the SAD is p300-dependent, and demonstrate that this activity is associated with a physical interaction of the SAD with the amino terminus of p300. These data identify a novel function of the middle linker region of Smad4, and define the role of the SAD as an important locus determining the transcriptional activation of the Smad complex. ;proline;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

35940634;Arid5a Mediates an IL-17-Dependent Pathway That Drives Autoimmunity but Not Antifungal Host Defense.;IL-17 contributes to the pathogenesis of certain autoimmune diseases, but conversely is essential for host defense against fungi. Ab-based biologic drugs that neutralize IL-17 are effective in autoimmunity but can be accompanied by adverse side effects. Candida albicans is a commensal fungus that is the primary causative agent of oropharyngeal and disseminated candidiasis. Defects in IL-17 signaling cause susceptibility to candidiasis in mice and humans. A key facet of IL-17 receptor signaling involves RNA-binding proteins, which orchestrate the fate of target mRNA transcripts. In tissue culture models we showed that the RNA-binding protein AT-rich interaction domain 5A (Arid5a) promotes the stability and/or translation of multiple IL-17-dependent mRNAs. Moreover, during oropharyngeal candidiasis, Arid5a is elevated within the oral mucosa in an IL-17-dependent manner. However, the contribution of Arid5a to IL-17-driven events in vivo is poorly defined. In this study, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to generate mice lacking Arid5a. Arid5a -/- mice were fully resistant to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an autoimmune setting in which IL-17 signaling drives pathology. Surprisingly, Arid5a -/- mice were resistant to oropharyngeal candidiasis and systemic candidiasis, similar to immunocompetent wild-type mice and contrasting with mice defective in IL-17 signaling. Therefore, Arid5a-dependent signals mediate pathology in autoimmunity and yet are not required for immunity to candidiasis, indicating that selective targeting of IL-17 signaling pathway components may be a viable strategy for development of therapeutics that spare IL-17-driven host defense.;threonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
1845885;The promoter, transcriptional unit, and coding sequence of herpes simplex virus 1 family 35 proteins are contained within and in frame with the UL26 open reading frame.;"The herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) genome specifies an abundant capsid protein which in denaturing gels forms multiple bands designated family 35 proteins (D.K. Braun, B. Roizman, and L. Pereira, J. Virol. 49:142-153, 1984). Nucleotide-sequencing studies have assigned the coding sequences of these proteins to the open reading frame UL26 (D.J. McGeoch, M.A. Dalrymple, A.J. Davidson, A. Dolan, M.C. Frame, D. McNab, L.J. Perry, J.E. Scott, and P. Taylor, J. Gen. Virol. 69:1531-1574, 1988). IN studies reported here, a series of plasmid constructs containing deletions or insertions of an alpha 4 promoter or of a sequence encoding a cytomegalovirus epitope reacting with a mouse monoclonal antibody revealed the following: the open reading frame previously designated UL26 encodes two proteins which share amino acid sequences, and each coding domain is contained in its own transcriptional unit that terminates at a common, unique poly(A) site. On the basis of the transcription initiation site (+1), it was predicted that the UL26 open reading frame encodes a protein of 635 amino acids, and a protein with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 75,000 has been identified. The second transcriptional unit, designated UL26.5, predicted to specify a protein of 329 amino acids, encodes the family 35 proteins; it is transcribed by an mRNA which initiates at approximately nucleotide +1000 of the UL26 transcription initiation site and is translated from the methionine initiation codon located at position +1099 of the UL26 transcriptional unit. The DNA fragment comprising the sequences downstream of the HpaI cleavage site (+832 of UL26) contains both the promoter and the coding sequence of family 35 proteins and is both competent and efficient in expressing the proteins in transfected cells superinfected with HSV-1 or HSV-2.";alanine;-;-;LCR_without_function
8961927;Structural and thermodynamic characterization of the interaction of the SH3 domain from Fyn with the proline-rich binding site on the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase.;"The interaction of the Fyn SH3 domain with the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase is investigated using structural detail and thermodynamic data. The solution structure complex of the SH3 domain with a proline-rich peptide mimic of the binding site on the p85 subunit is described. This indicates that the peptide binds as a poly(L-proline) type II helix. Circular dichroism spectroscopic studies reveal that in the unbound state the peptide exhibits no structure. Thermodynamic data for the binding of this peptide to the SH3 domain suggest that the weak binding (approximately 31 microM) of this interaction is, in part, due to the entropically unfavorable effect of helix formation (delta S0 = -78 J.mol-1.K-1). Binding of the SH3 domain to the intact p85 subunit (minus its own SH3 domain) is tighter, and the entropic and enthalpic contributions are very different from those given by the peptide interaction (delta S0 = +252 J.mol-1.K-1; delta H0 = +44 kJ.mol-1). From these dramatically different thermodynamic measurements we are able to conclude that the interaction of the proline-rich peptide does not effectively mimic the interaction of the intact p85 subunit with the SH3 domain and suggest that other interactions could be important.";proline;helix;-;LCR_with_function

Like poly(A) these fragments appear to be protein associated in the mRNP complex. Non-poly(A) fragments in mRNP prepared from adenovirus-infected cells harvested in the late phase of infection contained only 3% of CAP structures and 12% of internally located methylated nucleotides.

26369869;Personalized liposome-protein corona in the blood of breast, gastric and pancreatic cancer patients.;When nanoparticles (NPs) are dispersed in a biofluid, they are covered by a protein corona the composition of which strongly depends on the protein source. Recent studies demonstrated that the type of disease has a crucial role in the protein composition of the NP corona with relevant implications on personalized medicine. Proteomic variations frequently occur in cancer with the consequence that the bio-identity of NPs in the blood of cancer patients may differ from that acquired after administration to healthy volunteers. In this study we investigated the correlation between alterations of plasma proteins in breast, gastric and pancreatic cancer and the biological identity of clinically approved AmBisome-like liposomes as determined by a combination of dynamic light scattering, zeta potential analysis, one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1D-SDS-PAGE) and semi-quantitative densitometry. While size of liposome-protein complexes was not significantly different between cancer groups, the hard corona from pancreatic cancer patients was significantly less negatively charged. Of note, the hard corona from pancreatic cancer patients was more enriched than those of other cancer types this enrichment being most likely due to IgA and IgG with possible correlations with the autoantibodies productions in cancer. Given the strict relationship between tumor antigen-specific autoantibodies and early cancer detection, our results could be the basis for the development of novel nanoparticle-corona-based screening tests of cancer.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
9389476;Facile synthesis of block copolypeptides of defined architecture.;Many natural polymeric materials (particularly structural proteins) display a hierarchy of structure over several length scales. Block copolymers are able to self-assemble into ordered nanostructures, but the random-coiled nature of their polymer chains usually suppresses any further levels of organization. The use of components with regular structures, such as rigid-rod polymers, can increase the extent of spatial organization in self-assembling materials. But the synthesis of such polymeric components typically involves complicated reaction steps that are not suitable for large-scale production. Proteins form hierarchically organized structures in which the fundamental motifs are generally alpha-helical coils and beta-sheets. Attempts to synthesize polypeptides with well-defined amino-acid sequences, which might adopt similar organized structures, have been plagued by unwanted side reactions that give rise to products with a wide range of molecular weights, hampering the formation of well-defined peptide block copolymers. Here I describe a polymerization strategy that overcomes these difficulties by using organonickel initiators which suppress chain-transfer and termination side reactions. This approach allows the facile synthesis of block copolypeptides with well-defined sequences, which might provide new peptide-based biomaterials with potential applications in tissue engineering, drug delivery and biomimetic composite formation.;-;-;-;hard_0
7630729;Phosphorylation of a chloroplast RNA-binding protein changes its affinity to RNA.;An RNA-binding protein of 28 kDa (28RNP) was previously isolated from spinach chloroplasts and found to be required for 3' end-processing of chloroplast mRNAs. The amino acid sequence of 28RNP revealed two approximately 80 amino-acid RNA-binding domains, as well as an acidic- and glycine-rich amino terminal domain. Upon analysis of the RNA-binding properties of the 'native' 28RNP in comparison to the recombinant bacterial expressed protein, differences were detected in the affinity to some chloroplastic 3' end RNAs. It was suggested that post-translational modification can modulate the affinity of the 28RNP in the chloroplast to different RNAs. In order to determine if phosphorylation accounts for this post-translational modification, we examined if the 28RNP is a phosphoprotein and if it can serve as a substrate for protein kinases. It was found that the 28RNP was phosphorylated when intact chloroplasts were metabolically labeled with [32P] orthophosphate, and that recombinant 28RNP served as an excellent substrate in vitro for protein kinase isolated from spinach chloroplasts or recombinant alpha subunit of maize casein kinase II. The 28RNP was apparently phosphorylated at one site located in the acidic domain at the N-terminus of the protein. Site-directed mutagenesis of the serines in that region revealed that the phosphorylation of the protein was eliminated when serine number 22 from the N-terminus was changed to tryptophan. RNA-binding analysis of the phosphorylated 28RNP revealed that the affinity of the phosphorylated protein was reduced approximately 3-4-fold in comparison to the non-phosphorylated protein. Therefore, phosphorylation of the 28RNP modulates its affinity to RNA and may play a significant role in its biological function in the chloroplast. ;glycine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
7496053;Hypertensive heart disease and the diabetic patient.;Patients with diabetes mellitus are particularly vulnerable to cardiovascular disease. Although structural and functional myocardial complications are present in patients with diabetes alone, they are particularly severe in patients with both diabetes and hypertension. Considerable evidence--both in experimental animal models and in humans--points to hypertension as of critical importance in the pathogenesis of severe diabetic heart disease. In diabetic hypertensive cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease as well as structural and functional abnormalities are more pronounced than would be expected from either process alone. The myocardial damage is attributed mainly to hypertension, whereas the myocellular dysfunction is attributed mainly to diabetes. Together, the consequences to the myocardium are devastating. Strict control of the hypertension and diabetes may have an ameliorative effect on the subsequent development of diabetic heart disease.;-;-;-;hard_0
9348197;Active repression by thyroid hormone receptor splicing variant alpha2 requires specific regulatory elements in the context of native triiodothyronine-regulated gene promoters.;Structural requirements for the inhibitory action of thyroid hormone receptor splicing variant alpha2 (TR alpha2) on T3/TRbeta1-mediated transactivation were investigated in native promoters of two T3-regulated genes: the brain-specific myelin basic protein (MBP) and the housekeeping malic enzyme (ME). T3/TRbeta1 transactivation of MBP256-chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) and ME315-CAT constructs was inhibited and unaffected by TR alpha2, respectively. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, TR alpha2 bound MBP-thyroid response element (TRE) as a monomer but failed to interact with ME-TRE. Mutations of ME-TRE allowed TR alpha2 binding but not inhibition of T3/TRbeta1-mediated transactivation. In the context of the MBP promoter, replacement of MBP-TRE with ME-TRE or exchange of MBP TATA-like box with the ME GC-rich region spanning the transcription start site abolished TR alpha2 dominant negative action. Simultaneous introduction of both MBP-TRE and MBP TATA-like box in the context of ME promoter, however, triggered TR alpha2 inhibition of T3/TRbeta1 transactivation, indicating that these regulatory elements are necessary, but not individually sufficient, to mediate TR alpha2 dominant negative activity. Functional studies at low TR alpha2/TRbeta1 ratios revealed that binding to TRE facilitates TR alpha2 dominant negative action while prevention of DNA interaction by altering TR alpha2 P-box structure preserved TR alpha2 inhibitory effect, although with lower potency. In conclusion, the results suggest that, in native promoters of T3-regulated genes, a dual molecular mechanism, with DNA-binding dependent and DNA-binding independent components, underlies TR alpha2 dominant negative activity.;cysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Cross-linking of DNA to nuclear proteins by ultraviolet light showed a cell-type dependent inverse correlation of genomic susceptibility with binding of (dA.dT) (dA.dT) sequences, compared to that shown with (dG.dC) (dG.dC), regardless of methylation in cytosines. Exposure to cholera toxin partly reversed genomic susceptibility and increased DNA/protein cross-linking in melanocytes. In contrast, melanoma cells showed decreased DNA/protein interactions and greater genome susceptibility after exposure to cholera toxin or okadaic acid. Our data suggest that a molecular mechanism for differential genome exposure in cancer cells involves a modified expression of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins.;-;nucleic acid binding;-;hard_2
23209321;Complete dependence on IRAK4 kinase activity in TLR2, but not TLR4, signaling pathways underlies decreased cytokine production and increased susceptibility to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection in IRAK4 kinase-inactive mice.;IRAK4 is critical for MyD88-dependent TLR signaling, and patients with Irak4 mutations are extremely susceptible to recurrent bacterial infections. In these studies, mice homozygous for a mutant IRAK4 that lacks kinase activity (IRAK4(KDKI)) were used to address the role of IRAK4 in response to TLR agonists or bacterial infection. IRAK4(KDKI) macrophages exhibited diminished responsiveness to the TLR4 agonist LPS and little to no response to the TLR2 agonist Pam3Cys compared with wild-type macrophages as measured by cytokine mRNA, cytokine protein expression, and MAPK activation. Importantly, we identified two kinases downstream of the MAPKs, MNK1 and MSK1, whose phosphorylation is deficient in IRAK4(KDKI) macrophages stimulated through either TLR2 or TLR4, suggesting that IRAK4 contributes to TLR signaling beyond the initial phosphorylation of MAPKs. Additionally, IRAK4(KDKI) macrophages produced minimal cytokine mRNA expression in response to the Gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus compared with WT cells, and IRAK4(KDKI) mice exhibited increased susceptibility and decreased cytokine production in vivo upon S. pneumoniae infection. Treatment of infected mice with a complex of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid with poly-L-lysine and carboxymethyl cellulose (Hiltonol), a potent TLR3 agonist, significantly improved survival of both WT and IRAK4(KDKI) mice, thereby providing a potential treatment strategy in both normal and immunocompromised patients.;-;kinase activity;poly-L-;hard_3
51937;Murine intracisternal type A particles: a biochemical characterization.;Intracisternal A particle preparations from a murine neuroblastoma cell line (N18) and from a mineral oil-induced murine plasmacytoma (MOPC-104E) contain both an endogenous RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity and high molecular-weight polyadenylic acid (poly[A])-containing RNA. The DNA polymerase activity is stimulated by oligo(dG)-poly(C) and oligo(dT)-poly(A) and to a lesser extent by oligo(dT)-poly(dA), in agreement with previous reports. The high-molecular-weight RNA is predominantly 35S and contains a poly(A) tract of approximately 220 nucleotides as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Small amounts of 70S RNA are also present. This RNA preparation contains RNA homologous to RNA from type-C particles, as judged by molecular hybridization experiments. However, since this RNA derives only in part from A-particles and in part from other cellular RNA, hybridization of A-particle endogenously synthesized DNA or reverse transcripts of A-particle RNA to purified type C viral 70S RNA may more accurately reflect the relationship of A-particle RNA to RNA from C-particles. None of these DNA transcripts hybridizes significantly to C-particle 70S RNA, although MOPC and N18 DNA transcripts share significant homology. Our interpretation of these results is that murine intracisternal A particles are not closely related genetically to the tested murine type C viruses, although an alternate possibility is that all the A-particle DNA transcripts are copied from only a small part of the genome, which is unrelated to C-particle RNA.;cysteine;-;polyacrylamide;LCR_with_hard
32095119;EEG Analysis in Structural Focal Epilepsy Using the Methods of Nonlinear Dynamics (Lyapunov Exponents, Lempel-Ziv Complexity, and Multiscale Entropy).;"This paper analyzes a case with the patient having focal structural epilepsy by processing electroencephalogram (EEG) fragments containing the ""sharp wave"" pattern of brain activity. EEG signals were recorded using 21 channels. Based on the fact that EEG signals are time series, an approach has been developed for their analysis using nonlinear dynamics tools: calculating the Lyapunov exponent's spectrum, multiscale entropy, and Lempel-Ziv complexity. The calculation of the first Lyapunov exponent is carried out by three methods: Wolf, Rosenstein, and Sano-Sawada, to obtain reliable results. The seven Lyapunov exponent spectra are calculated by the Sano-Sawada method. For the observed patient, studies showed that with medical treatment, his condition did not improve, and as a result, it was recommended to switch from conservative treatment to surgical. The obtained results of the patient's EEG study using the indicated nonlinear dynamics methods are in good agreement with the medical report and MRI data. The approach developed for the analysis of EEG signals by nonlinear dynamics methods can be applied for early detection of structural changes.";-;-;-;hard_0
12519392;Definition of the HLA-A2 restricted peptides recognized by human CD8+ effector T cells by flow-assisted sorting of the CD8+ CD45RA+ CD28- T cell subpopulation.;In response to antigenic stimulation, naive MHC-class I restricted and antigen-specific CD8+ CD45RA+ CD28+ T cells undergo clonal expansion, differentiate into CD8+ CD45RO+ memory T cells and convert to CD8+ CD45RA+ CD28- T cells displaying potent immune effector functions upon re-encounter with the nominal antigen. We show that the effector CD8+ CD45RA+ CD28- T cell subset is expanded in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from patients with human papilloma virus (HPV)+ cervical lesions as well as in PBL from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Flow-cytometric cell sorted CD8+ CD45RA+ CD28- and CD8+ CD45RA+ CD28- T cells were tested for recognition of HLA-A2 restricted peptides derived either from the human papillomavirus (HPV)16-E7 gene product, or from M. tuberculosis antigens. Mostly CD8+ CD45+ CD28- T cells define antigen/peptide-specific and MHC-restricted responses. These data were confirmed in PBL from patients with tuberculosis using HLA-A2 tetramer-complexes loaded with a peptide from the M. tuberculosis Ag85b antigen by flow cytometry. The sorting of this T cell subset enables to determine the fine specificity of CD8+ effector T cells without the need for in vitro manipulation.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
8649425;A developmentally modulated chromatin structure at the mouse immunoglobulin kappa 3' enhancer.;Transcription of the mouse immunoglobulin kappa gene is controlled by two enhancers: the intronic enhancer (Ei) that occurs between the joining (J kappa) and constant (C kappa) exons and the 3' enhancer (E3') located 8.5 kb downstream of the gene. To understand the role of E3' in the activation of the mouse immunoglobulin kappa gene, we studied its chromatin structure in cultured B-cell lines arrested at various stages of differentiation. We found that 120 bp of the enhancer's transcriptional core becomes DNase I hypersensitive early in B-cell development. Genomic footprinting of pro-B and pre-B cells localized this chromatin alteration to B-cell-specific protections at the region including the direct repeat (DR) and the sequence downstream of the DR (DS), the PU.1-NFEM-5 site, and the core's E-box motif, identifying bound transcription factors prior to kappa gene rearrangement. Early footprints were, however, not detected at downstream sites proposed to play a negative role in transcription. The early chromatin structure persisted through the mature B-cell stage but underwent a dramatic shift in plasma cells, correlating with the loss of guanosine protection within the DR-DS junction and the appearance of novel footprints at a GC-rich motif upstream and the NF-E1 (YY1/delta)-binding site downstream. Gel shift analysis demonstrated that the DR-DS junction is bound by a factor with properties similar to those of BSAP (B-cell-specific activator protein). These results reveal developmental-stage-specific changes in the composition of nuclear factors bound to E3', clarify the role of factors that bind constitutively in vitro, and point to the differentiation of mature B cells to plasma cells as an important transitional point in the function of this enhancer. The observed changes in nuclear factor composition were accompanied by the rearrangement of positioned nucleosomes that flank the core region, suggesting a role for both nuclear factors and chromatin structure in modulating kappa E3' function during B-cell development. The functional implications of the observed chromatin alterations are discussed in the context of recent studies on kappa E3' and the factors that bind to it.;cysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
22588127;EGF-like peptide-enhanced cell movement in Dictyostelium is mediated by protein kinases and the activity of several cytoskeletal proteins.;DdEGFL1, a synthetic epidermal growth factor-like (EGFL) peptide based on the first EGFL repeat of the extracellular matrix, cysteine-rich, calmodulin-binding protein CyrA, has previously been shown to sustain the threonine phosphorylation of a 210kDa protein during the starvation of Dictyostelium cells. Immunoprecipitation coupled with a LC/MS/MS analysis identified the 210kDa protein as vinculin B (VinB). VinB shares sequence similarity with mammalian vinculin, a protein that links the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane. Both threonine phosphorylated VinB (P-VinB) and VinB-GFP localized to the cytoplasm and cytoskeleton of Dictyostelium amoebae. VinB-GFP was also shown to be threonine phosphorylated and co-immunoprecipitated with established vinculin-binding cytoskeletal proteins (e.g. myosin II heavy chain, actin, alpha-actinin, talin). P-VinB and VinB-GFP were detected in DdEGFL1 pull-down assays, which also identified a 135kDa phosphothreonine protein and two phosphotyrosine proteins (35 and 32kDa) as potential components of the DdEGFL1 signaling pathway. DdEGFL1-enhanced cell movement required the cytoskeletal proteins talin B and paxillin B and tyrosine kinase activity mediated by PKA signaling, however VinB threonine phosphorylation was shown to be independent of PI3K/PLA2 signaling and PI3K and PKA kinase activity. Finally, VinB-GFP over-expression suppressed DdEGFL1-enhanced random cell movement, but not folic acid-mediated chemotaxis. Together, this study provides the first evidence for VinB function plus new insight into the signaling pathway(s) mediating EGFL repeat/peptide-enhanced cell movement in Dictyostelium. This information is integrated into an emerging model that summarizes existing knowledge. ;cysteine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
9742215;Transcription of the juvenile hormone esterase gene under the control of both an initiator and AT-rich motif.;"The binding of transcription factors to the core promoter of the juvenile hormone esterase gene was functionally characterized using both a cell-free in vitro transcription functional assay and a cell transfection assay. A core JHE promoter (-61 to +28 bp relative to transcription start site) supported faithful transcription from the in vivo transcription start site. The nuclear extracts from the Sf9 insect cell line that provided transcription from that template also bound to that template as a probe in gel-mobility shift assays. Deletion or transversion of the initiator-binding motif (-1 to +4 bp) abolished detectable transcription either in vitro or in transfected cells. An AT-rich motif (ATATAT; -28 to -23 bp) serves another transcription factor-binding site. Mutation of the AT-rich motif to a canonical TATA-box preserved transcription, while either its deletion or complete transversion abolished or significantly reduced detectable transcriptional activity. These results indicate that, under these conditions, the functional operation of this core promoter approaches that of a composite promoter in which both the TATA- and initiator-binding protein complexes are necessary, even for basal transcription. On the other hand, these debilitating mutations to either the TATA box or initiator motif did not prevent the ability of the corresponding gel-shift competitive probes to compete with the wild-type promoter for binding by the transcription factors. Even a double transversion of both the AT-rich motif and the initiator-binding motif was able to competitively displace the protein complex that bound to the labelled wild-type probe. These data strongly indicate the presence of (an) additional core-promoter-associated transcription factor(s) (that is not the 'downstream element') that contact(s) the AT-binding complex and/or initiator-binding factor with sufficient avidity to remove them from binding to the competing wild-type promoter sequence.";threonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
2247454;Molecular cloning of the large subunit of transforming growth factor type beta masking protein and expression of the mRNA in various rat tissues.;Masking protein (MP), which neutralizes the activity of transforming growth factor type beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), is composed of a dimeric N-terminal part of a TGF-beta 1 precursor of Mr 39,000 and an unknown large subunit of Mr 105,000-120,000. The deduced primary structure of the MP large subunit was elucidated by determining the nucleotide sequence of its cDNA. The cDNA encodes a prepro-precursor of 1712 amino acid residues with a calculated Mr of 186,596. The mature large subunit seems to be derived proteolytically from a prepro-precursor and the calculated Mr is 91,606.

18795813;In-vitro phosphorylation activity by recombinant alpha and beta subunits of Bombyx mori casein kinase 2.;To clarify the control mechanism of the catalytic activity of casein kinase 2 (CK2) during early embryonic development in the silkworm, Bombyx mori, we attempted an in-vitro functional analysis by using the recombinant alpha and beta subunits of B. mori CK2 (rBmCK2alpha and rBmCK2beta) produced in a bacterial system. The renatured rBmCK2alpha possessed protein kinase activity. When rBmCK2alpha and rBmCK2beta were reconstituted in an approximate 1:1 molar ratio, the catalytic activity was almost the same as that of rBmCK2alpha alone. The catalytic activity of rBmCK2alpha was inhibited by polylysine, which is one of the activators of CK2 activity. However, when using the reconstituted rBmCK2alpha and rBmCK2beta (rBmCK2), activation by polylysine was observed. We examined the influence of sorbitol and 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-OHK), which are contained mainly in diapause eggs, on the phosphorylation activity of rBmCK2. Three-OHK inhibited rBmCK2 activity, but sorbitol had no effect on it. Furthermore, a functional analysis using rBmCK2alpha and beta subunits of Drosophila melanogaster CK2 revealed that a difference in the C-terminal amino acid of the CK2beta subunit influenced the phosphorylation activity of rBmCK2alpha. These results may provide new insights for clarifying the control mechanism of B. mori casein kinase 2 in eggs.;lysine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
2735884;Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia in a child with congenital enteropeptidase deficiency and hypogammaglobulinaemia.;A case of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia in a 10 year old girl is described which provides some evidence for an inherited aetiology of this unusual form of heart disease. The parents of this child were first cousins, thus increasing the possibility of inherited disorders in their offspring. She had been known from infancy to have the rare disorder of congenital deficiency of intestinal enteropeptidase, and low serum immunoglobulins G and A. An untyped adenovirus was grown from a myocardial biopsy taken early in the course of her cardiac disease. However, it is unlikely that this virus was a major factor in the aetiology of her cardiac disease. Both the cardiac and intestinal diseases are now commonly believed to result from hereditary factors, and this report provides further support for this view.;-;-;-;hard_0
202615;Rat intestine secretes discoid high density lipoprotein.;High density lipoprotein was isolated from pooled rat serum and mesenteric lymph of lymph fistula rats. In most experiments, 5,5'-dithionitrobenzoic acid, an inhibitor of the enzyme lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase, was added during the collection of lymph to prevent modification of the lipid composition of newly secreted lipoproteins. Negative staining electron microscopy of lymph high density lipoprotein revealed discoidal particles (190+/-3 x 55+/-1 A) which tended to form rouleaux, smaller spherical particles were also present. Serum high density lipoprotein contained only spherical particles (diameter 93+/-4 A). Lipid analysis showed that lymph high density lipoprotein was enriched in phospholipid and deficient in cholesterol esters when compared to serum high density lipoprotein. The phospholipid to cholesterol esters ratio was greatest in basal lymph high density lipoprotein when compared to fatty lymph and serum high density lipoprotein. From analysis of the lipid compositional data and direct particle measurement by electron microscopy, it could be determined that congruent with50% of basal lymph high density lipoprotein and 30% of fatty lymph high density lipoprotein was discoid. Basal lymph high density lipoprotein was enriched in apoA-I and deficient in the arginine-rich peptide, and the apoprotein composition of fatty lymph high density lipoprotein more closely resembled serum. These observations demonstrate that intestinal lymph contains two types of high density lipoprotein particles, a discoid nascent particle deficient in cholesterol ester and rich in apoA-I, and spherical high density lipoprotein derived from plasma. A significant amount of lymph high density lipoprotein appears to be secreted by the intestine.;arginine;-;-;LCR_without_function
32690595;The structural basis for monoclonal antibody 5D2 binding to the tryptophan-rich loop of lipoprotein lipase.;For three decades, the LPL-specific monoclonal antibody 5D2 has been used to investigate LPL structure/function and intravascular lipolysis. 5D2 has been used to measure LPL levels, block the triglyceride hydrolase activity of LPL, and prevent the propensity of concentrated LPL preparations to form homodimers. Two early studies on the location of the 5D2 epitope reached conflicting conclusions, but the more convincing report suggested that 5D2 binds to a tryptophan (Trp)-rich loop in the carboxyl terminus of LPL. The same loop had been implicated in lipoprotein binding. Using surface plasmon resonance, we showed that 5D2 binds with high affinity to a synthetic LPL peptide containing the Trp-rich loop of human (but not mouse) LPL. We also showed, by both fluorescence and UV resonance Raman spectroscopy, that the Trp-rich loop binds lipids. Finally, we used X-ray crystallography to solve the structure of the Trp-rich peptide bound to a 5D2 Fab fragment. The Trp-rich peptide contains a short α-helix, with two Trps projecting into the antigen recognition site. A proline substitution in the α-helix, found in mouse LPL, is expected to interfere with several hydrogen bonds, explaining why 5D2 cannot bind to mouse LPL.;tryptophan;helix;-;LCR_with_function
2041742;The amdR product and a CCAAT-binding factor bind to adjacent, possibly overlapping DNA sequences in the promoter region of the Aspergillus nidulans amdS gene.;The amdS gene of Aspergillus nidulans is regulated by a number of positively acting regulatory genes which act additively and independently. Using gel mobility shift assays with crude nuclear extracts we show here that the product of one of these regulatory genes, the amdR gene, binds to DNA fragments containing part of the promoter region of the amdS gene. This confirms the earlier prediction from DNA sequence data that amdR encodes a DNA-binding protein containing a cysteine-rich 'zinc finger' motif. In addition we detected the binding of another previously unidentified protein to an adjacent, possibly overlapping region of the amdS 5' sequence at the site of a consensus 'CCAAT-box' sequence. Replacement of the CCAAT sequence with CCTTT abolished the binding of this protein which we have designated as an A. nidulans 'CCAAT-box' binding factor (AnCF). The 'CCAAT-box' sequence appears to be involved in determining the basal level of transcription of amdS (T.G. Littlejohn and M.J.H., unpublished data). This suggests that AnCF is a transcription factor, and that the 'CCAAT-box' sequences found in the promoters of some filamentous fungal genes function as binding sites for these factors, as in other eucaryotes.;cysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
16934805;Synthesis and characterization of a novel class of reducing agents that are highly neuroprotective for retinal ganglion cells.;"Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) undergo apoptosis after axonal injury, in part regulated by an intracellular superoxide anion burst, for which the target(s) are unknown. Shifting the RGC redox state towards reduction and preventing sulfhydryl oxidation is neuroprotective in vitro and in vivo, implying that one or more sulfhydryls on one or more critical proteins may be involved. We synthesized novel borane-protected analogues of the reductant tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) with the intent of increasing cell permeability and improving chemical stability, and tested their ability to increase RGC survival in vitro. Retinal ganglion cells of postnatal day 2-4 Long-Evans rats were retrogradely labeled with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). At postnatal days 11-13 the animals were sacrificed, the retinas enzymatically dissociated and plated on poly-L-lysine-coated 96-well flat-bottomed tissue culture plates for 72 h in Neurobasal-A, B27 supplement lacking antioxidants, and TCEP, bis(3-propionic acid methyl ester)phenylphosphine borane complex (PB1), (3-propionic acid methyl ester)diphenylphosphine borane complex (PB2), or three commercially available phosphines. Viable DAPI-positive RGCs were identified by calcein-AM staining. At 72 h, PB1 was effective at rescuing acutely axotomized RGCs at concentrations from 1 nM to 100 microM. RGC survival with 1 nM PB1 was 174+/-12% of control (p=0.002). Another compound, PB2, rescued RGCs at 10 pM (177+/-24%; p=0.006) and 10 nM (251+/-34%; p=0.004) at 72 h. A PAMPA assay demonstrated that PB1 and PB2 were substantially more permeable than TCEP. These data demonstrate that modified reductants are effective RGC neuroprotectants at picomolar-nanomolar concentrations. We propose that these novel molecules may act by inhibiting the sulfhydryl oxidation effect of an intracellular superoxide burst.";-;-;poly-L-;hard_1
26828945;Evidence for the Nucleo-Apical Shuttling of a Beta-Catenin Like Plasmodium falciparum Armadillo Repeat Containing Protein.;Eukaryotic Armadillo (ARM) repeat proteins are multifaceted with prominent roles in cell-cell adhesion, cytoskeletal regulation and intracellular signaling among many others. One such ARM repeat containing protein, ARM Repeats Only (ARO), has recently been demonstrated in both Toxoplasma (TgARO) and Plasmodium (PfARO) parasites to be targeted to the rhoptries during the late asexual stages. TgARO has been implicated to play an important role in rhoptry positioning i.e. directing the rhoptry towards the apical end of the parasite. Here, we report for the first time that PfARO exhibits a DNA binding property and a dynamic sub-cellular localization between the nucleus (early schizont) and rhoptry (late schizont) during the different stages of the asexual blood-stage life cycle. PfARO possesses a putative nuclear export signal (NES) and the nucleo-apical shuttling was sensitive to Leptomycin B (LMB) suggesting that the nuclear export was mediated by CRM1. Importantly, PfARO specifically bound an A-T rich DNA sequence of the P. falciparum Gyrase A (PfgyrA) gene, suggesting that the DNA binding specificity of PfARO is likely due to the AT-richness of the probe. This is a novel functional characteristic that has not been reported previously for any P. falciparum ARM containing protein and suggests a putative role for PfARO in gene regulation. This study describes for the first time a conserved P. falciparum ARM repeat protein with a high degree of functional versatility.  ;threonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
6438090;A heterozygous defect for structurally altered pro-alpha 2 chain of type I procollagen in a mild variant of osteogenesis imperfecta. The altered structure decreases the thermal stability of procollagen and makes it resistant to procollagen N-proteinase.;Cultured skin fibroblasts from a proband with an autosomal dominant variant of osteogenesis inperfecta were found to synthesize approximately equal amounts of normal pro-alpha 2(I) chains of type I procollagen and pro-alpha 2(I) chains which migrated more rapidly when examined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. The structural alteration was present in alpha 2(I)-CB4, a cyanogen bromide fragment containing amino acid residues 7-327 of the alpha 2 chain, and it appeared to be a deletion of about 30 amino acids. The pro-alpha 2(I) chains with the apparent deletion associated with normal pro-alpha 1(I) chains synthesized by the same fibroblasts and formed triple-helical type I procollagen. The presence of the altered pro-alpha 2 chains in trimers of procollagen had two consequences in terms of the physical properties of the molecule. One was to decrease the thermal stability of the protein as judged by resistance to proteolysis at 37 degrees C and by the helix to coil transition as assayed by circular dichroism. The second consequence was to make type I procollagen containing the shortened pro-alpha 2(I) chains resistant to digestion by procollagen N-proteinase. The simplest explanation for the data is that the apparent deletion in half the pro-alpha 2(I) chains produced a partial unfolding of the N-terminal region of type I procollagen which prevented processing of the protein by procollagen N-proteinase.;-;helix;polyacrylamide;hard_3
1212196;Differential subnuclear distribution of polyadenylate-rich ribonuclei acid during induction of egg-yolk protein synthesis in male Xenopus liver by oestradiol-17 beta.;A 4-8-fold increase in the rate of hepatic nuclear RNA synthesis occurred within 11 h after a single injection of oestradiol-17 beta to male Xenopus to induce egg-yolk protein synthesis. 2. By using a gentle procedure for fractionating nuclei into their major structurally different components [J. R. Tata& B. Baker (1974) Exp. Cell Res. 83. 111-124], it was found that the hormone-induced increase in the total amount of newly made RNA was associated with a 2-10-fold increase in the poly(A) content of nuclear RNA. 3. When the poly (A) content of nuclear RNA was determined by hybridization to poly[3H](U) or specific binding to oligo(dT)-cellulose, most of the increase (10-fold) in poly (A) content of newly synthesized RNA was associated with the euchromatin fractions, whereas the increase was less marked in the other subnuclear fractions. 4. Resolution of nuclear RNA into poly (A)-poor and poly(A)-rich RNA species by chromatography on oligo(dT)-cellulose, followed by polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis with sodium dodecyl sulphate or in the pressence of 99% formamide, revealed that the hormone caused a preferential enhancement of high-molecular-weight (25S-60S) poly (A)-rich HnRNA (heterogeneous nuclear RNA,) much of which was associated with euchromatin and not with the nuclear sap. 5. Induction of vitellogenin in male frogs was in particular characterized by the appearance of a high-molecular-weight polyadenylated component exhibiting a peak at 35-36S, i.e. a molecular weight of approx. 2.05x10(6)+/-0.15x10(6). Although there is no evidence as yet that such a polyadenylated high-molecular-weight nuclear RNA species contains sequences corresponding to vitellogenin mRNA, it is possible that a high proportion of the most stable form of the putative nuclear precursor to vitellogenin mRNA induced by oestrogen in male Xenopus liver may be only marginally bigger than the cytoplasmic mRNA, and may at any one time be predominantly associated with the euchromatin fraction.;alanine;-;polyacrylamide;LCR_with_hard

Enhanced coagulation and applying polymer flocculant-aid were compared through jar tests and pilot tests. Raw water and settled water were characterized and fractionated by resin adsorption. The results show that DOC composes major part of TOC. The DOC distribution keeps relatively stable all around the year with typical high amounts of the hydrophilic matter around 50%.

PACI with the species being tailor-made shows little pH effect during coagulation. The enhanced coagulation dosage for PACI could be 4.5 mg/L for the typical source water. The highest TOC removal achieved 31%. To be economically, 3 mg/L dose is the optimum dosage. Although hydrophilic fractions of NOM of both treatment strategies are removed about 30%, NOM causing UV254. absorbance were well removed(about 90%).

Evidence for multiple forms.;"Arginine deiminase (EC 3.5.3.6) from Mycoplasma arthritidis ATCC 14152 has been purified 6-fold by a new procedure, protamine sulfate fractionation and DEAE-agarose chromatography. The yield was 75 to 85%. The homogeneity of the final preparation was demonstrated by gel filtration, sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, NH2-terminal analysis, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at two pH values. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 80,000 as measured by gel filtration. The dimeric nature of the enzyme is suggested by the molecular weight of 49,000 from sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. Isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gels showed a major band corresponding to an isoelectric point of 7.0 and sometimes minor bands having lower isoelectric points. The ultraviolet spectrum exhibits a maximum at 278 nm. The enzyme has high affinity for L-arginine, with a Km value of 4 +/- 1 micronM at pH 7.2, 25 degrees. Mycoplasma arthritidis produces two distinct forms of arginine deiminase. Deiminase I is isolated from cells harvested during logarithmic phase; deiminase II is obtained from late logarithmic  or early stationary phase cells. The two forms are resolved by DEAE-agarose chromatography and by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Deiminase II elutes later from a DEAE-agarose column and moves toward the anode faster than deiminase I at pH 9.5 The two forms also have different specific activities and 280:260 spectral ratios. Each form has the same Km and molecular weight. A third form of the enzyme, deiminase III, can be generated by incubating deiminase II at pH 9.8, or in 50% saturated ammonium sulfate, pH 7.0, at 25 degrees. The transformation can be followed by chromatography and is completed within 10 h. The specific activity of deiminase III is 1.3 times that of deiminase II. No change in molecular weight or subunit dissociation was observed during the transformation.

The signal peptide contained many leucine residues. The NH2-terminal noncollagenous region was much larger than those of the other collagens and had a region homologous to the COOH-terminal domain of laminin A chain, but it did not contain a cysteine-rich region that was maintained in the region of the other collagens. This region also contained probable tyrosine sulfation sites, and short collagenous sequences that were interrupted by three noncollagenous segments. The main collagenous region of the alpha 1(V) chain consisted of 338 repeats of Gly-X-Y-triplet. This region had a high degree (82%) of homology with the amino acids of the collagen alpha 1(XI) chain. The COOH-terminal noncollagenous region resembled that of the alpha 1(XI) chain, too, and 8 residues of cysteine that were important for the formation of the triple helix structure of collagens were observed. These results suggest that the alpha 1(V) chain belongs to the fibrillar collagen relative to the alpha 1(XI) chain, but codon usage of the alpha 1(V) cDNA was clearly different from those of the other fibrillar collagens including the alpha 1(XI), while it was similar to type IV collagen. This result supposes a different evolution of the alpha 1(V) gene from those of the other fibrillar collagens.;cysteine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
8138843;Smoking among oral contraceptive users in Quebec in 1987.;"To determine whether an association exists between oral contraceptive (OC) use and cigarette smoking, the data base of the 1987 Québec Health Survey, a cross-sectional study of a provincial population, was sampled to provide a self-weighted subsample. This study population consisted of 292 OC users and a comparison group of 294 non-users, who would have been eligible to use OCs by virtue of their lacking contraindications to their use. 50.5% (95% CI: 44.8%-56.2%) of OC users smoked, as opposed to 41.0% (95% CI: 35.3%-46.7%) of non-users. There was a significant association between OC use and smoking; crude OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.06-2.04, p = 0.02. Controlling for effect modifiers and confounders by logistic regression revealed that the positive association prevails mainly in younger married, separated, and single women, whereas in women over 30 and cohabiting women the association is negative. While the negative association in women over 30 may reflect the efforts of physicians to prevent the adverse interactions between OC use and smoking by preventing older smokers from using OCs, the positive association in younger women indicates that physicians may be unable to prevent younger OC users from smoking.";-;-;-;hard_0
27011118;Glycosylation Status of CD43 Protein Is Associated with Resistance of Leukemia Cells to CTL-Mediated Cytolysis.;To improve cancer immunotherapy, it is important to understand how tumor cells counteract immune-surveillance. In this study, we sought to identify cell-surface molecules associated with resistance of leukemia cells to cytotoxic T cell (CTL)-mediated cytolysis. To this end, we first established thousands of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that react with MLL/AF9 mouse leukemia cells. Only two of these mAbs, designated R54 and B2, bound preferentially to leukemia cells resistant to cytolysis by a tumor cell antigen-specific CTLs. The antigens recognized by these mAbs were identified by expression cloning as the same protein, CD43, although their binding patterns to subsets of hematopoietic cells differed significantly from each other and from a pre-existing pan-CD43 mAb, S11. The epitopes of R54 and B2, but not S11, were sialidase-sensitive and expressed at various levels on leukemia cells, suggesting that binding of R54 or B2 is associated with the glycosylation status of CD43. R54high leukemia cells, which are likely to express sialic acid-rich CD43, were highly resistant to CTL-mediated cytolysis. In addition, loss of CD43 in leukemia cells or neuraminidase treatment of leukemia cells sensitized leukemia cells to CTL-mediated cell lysis. These results suggest that sialic acid-rich CD43, which harbors multiple sialic acid residues that impart a net negative surface charge, protects leukemia cells from CTL-mediated cell lysis. Furthermore, R54high or B2high leukemia cells preferentially survived in vivo in the presence of adaptive immunity. Taken together, these results suggest that the glycosylation status of CD43 on leukemia is associated with sensitivity to CTL-mediated cytolysis in vitro and in vivo. Thus, regulation of CD43 glycosylation is a potential strategy for enhancing CTL-mediated immunotherapy.;-;antigen;acid-rich;hard_3
8621884;An enzymatic method to determine receptor-mediated endocytosis.;Many studies have measured receptor-mediated endocytosis using radiolabeled ligands or antibodies. Upon ligation and cross-linking, the labeled ligand or antibody is endocytosed and the internalization of the radioisotope is assayed after stripping the uninternalized ligand from the cell membrane. This study reports on an enzymatic assay to measure receptor-mediated endocytosis and compares it with the radioactive method. The results show that receptor-mediated endocytosis measured using the peroxidase conjugated antibody is two fold higher than that measured with a radiolabeled antibody. Thus, approximately 38% endocytosis of CD3 is measured using an 125I-labeled antibody, whereas approximately 79% endocytosis is detected by peroxidase conjugated antibody method. Similar increases are also found with CD2 receptor-mediated endocytosis. Our study has demonstrated that the enzymatic method could be employed in determining receptor-mediated endocytosis. In addition to increased sensitivity, the enzymatic assay eliminates the use of radioactive materials.;-;-;-;hard_0
8547128;Platelets prime PMN via released PF4: mechanism of priming and synergy with GM-CSF.;Platelet-PMN interactions have been extensively studied and a spectrum of possible effects has been demonstrated. However, the physiological relevance of many of the observed in vitro phenomena remains obscure. Here we report a novel, and potentially pathophysiologically important, mechanism by which platelets can enhance PMN reactivity. We first observed that addition of platelets to PMN suspensions enhanced the chemiluminescence response of PMN to FMLP. This enhancement occurred without augmentation of superoxide generation and did not involve mutual platelet-PMN adhesion. The soluble material responsible was biochemically and immunologically identified as PF4 derived from platelet alpha-granules. The alpha-granule release was shown to be selective and required minimal platelet stimulation. Since the PF4 effect did not influence NADPH oxidase activation, it differed markedly from that of other priming agents such as GM-CSF. Further studies showed that the PF4 effect was attributable entirely to the surface translocation and secretion of primary granule myeloperoxidase. There was marked synergy between PF4 and GM-CSF and both were required for maximal potentiation of PMN reactivity. These results demonstrate that PF4 and GM-CSF employ different pathways in PMN priming. The ease with which platelets could release PF4 at sites of vessel-wall damage and inflammation suggests that platelet-PMN interaction via PF4 is likely to be of major pathophysiological importance.;-;-;-;hard_0
26707144;High-content screening identifies inhibitors of the nuclear translocation of ATF6.;Activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) is a transmembrane protein that consists of a cytoplasmic domain and an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) luminal domain. As unfolded protein levels arise in the ER, the ER cytoplasmic domain of ATF6 moves to the nucleus, where it activates the transcription of a range of genes, including those involved in apoptosis. As ATF6 only becomes functional once it has moved to the nucleus, compounds that inhibit its re-localization are of therapeutic interest. The aim of the present study was to rapidly and accurately identify such compounds using a novel image‑based, high‑content screening (HCS) technique. The results from the HCS analysis were then confirmed by luciferase reporter assays, western blot analysis and the measurement of cell viability. We found that HCS identified compounds which inhibited ATF6 nuclear translocation with high specificity, as confirmed by the luciferase reporter assay and western blot analysis. Moreover, we demonstrated that 3 of the 80 identified compounds impaired ATF6-mediated induced cell death. The data from this study support the theory that HCS is a novel, high throughput method which can be used for accurate and rapid compound screening.;-;transcription factor;-;hard_2

1527843;Mutations in two cysteine-histidine-rich clusters in adenovirus type 2 DNA polymerase affect DNA binding.;"Several point and linker insertion mutations in two Cys-His-rich regions of adenovirus (Ad) DNA polymerase (Pol) gene have been expressed in recombinant vaccinia virus. The resulting mutant enzymes were analyzed in vitro for their effects on DNA synthesis activity, on Ad-specific initiation assays, on gel shifts of Ad origin sequences, and on interactions with adenovirus preterminal protein (pTP) and nuclear factor I (NFI). In general, mutants in downstream Cys-His sequences had a pronounced effect in these assays. Mutants in the upstream Cys-His region had a moderate effect on DNA synthesis and elongation but failed to make dCMP-pTP initiation complexes and failed to make specific shifted complexes in a gel retardation assay. These mutants could still bind to pTP and NFI in a coimmunoprecipitation experiment, suggesting that this upstream Cys-His region of Ad Pol is involved either in specific Ad DNA origin binding or in nonspecific DNA binding. Changing residues within Cys doublets in the downstream Cys-His region had pronounced effects on many Ad Pol functions such as DNA synthesis, DNA binding, and in vitro initiation; however, these mutants showed little reduction in binding to pTP and NFI; mutants at other cysteines or histidines within this region of Ad Pol did not appear to have an effect on enzyme function. This observation suggests that the downstream Cys-His region of Ad Pol is important for DNA binding and might fold into a Zn finger motif. ";histidine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
8620929;Identification in immunolocalization of a new class of proteoglycan (keratan sulfate) to the neuritic plaques of Alzheimer's disease.;Previous studies have demonstrated three distinct classes of proteoglycans (PGs)/glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) localized to the characteristic lesions (i.e., neuritic plaques, cerebrovascular amyloid deposits, and neurofibrillary tangles) of Alzheimer's disease (AD). These include heparan sulfate (i.e., perlecan), dermatan sulfate (i.e., decorin), and chondroitin sulfate PGs/GAGs. In the present study, two different antibodies demonstrated the presence of a new class of PG (i.e., keratan sulfate) in the neuritic plaques of AD. Asynaptic vesicle keratan sulfate PG (known as SV2PG) was detected by the monoclonal antibodies, anti-SV2 and anti-SV4, which recognize the keratan sulfate core protein and GAG chains, of the SV2PG antigen, respectively. Both antibodies immunolocalized SV2PG primarily to synapses and to dystrophic neurites within neuritic plaques of AD and normal aged brain. The SV2PG was not immunolocalized to diffuse plaques, cerebrovascular amyloid deposits, or neurofibrillary tangles in AD or normal aged brain. SV2PG immunoreactivity in AD brain was similar in distribution to synaptophysin and showed apparent reduced immunoreactiviy+in AD cortex in comparison to age-matched controls. In conjunction with previous studies, these results now suggest that within the neuritic plaques of AD, there are at least four different classes of PGs present. Although heparan sulfate PGs are still the only class of PG immunolocalized to amyloid fibrils within the neuritic plaques of AD, the specific immunolocalization of keratan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate containing PGs to the periphery of plaques, suggests that these particular PGs/GAGs may also play distinct and important roles in neuritic plaque pathogenesis.;-;antigen;-;hard_2

12796502;Podocan, a novel small leucine-rich repeat protein expressed in the sclerotic glomerular lesion of experimental HIV-associated nephropathy.;Growing evidence suggests that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection of podocytes plays a central role in the glomerular disease of HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). As an approach to identify host genes involved in the pathogenesis of the sclerotic glomerular lesion in HIVAN, representational difference analysis of cDNA was used to identify differentially expressed genes in HIV-1 transgenic and nontransgenic podocytes. We isolated a novel member of the small leucine-rich repeat (SLR) protein family, podocan, that is expressed at high levels in the HIV-1 transgenic podocytes. In normal embryonic kidney, a 3.2-kb podocan transcript was detected at low levels, and expression increased dramatically within 24 h following birth. Expression of a 2.3-kb transcript became evident after birth and gradually increased to 50% of the total podocan RNA in the mature kidney. Phylogenetically, podocan represents a new class in the SLR protein gene family, an expanding protein family sharing homology with the small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycans. The 3.2-kb transcript encodes a predicted 611-amino acid secretory protein with 20 leucine-rich repeats, a unique N-terminal cysteine-rich cluster pattern and a highly acidic C-terminal domain. In situ hybridization of normal kidney revealed podocan mRNA expression in podocytes and likely vascular endothelial cells within the glomerulus. The immunohistochemical staining pattern of podocan protein in normal kidney glomeruli was consistent with that of the glomerular basement membrane, and staining was markedly increased in sclerotic glomerular lesions in the transgenic HIVAN model. Thus, podocan defines a new class within the SLR protein family and is a previously unrecognized component of the sclerotic glomerular lesion that develops in the course of experimental HIVAN.;cysteine;-;-;LCR_without_function

The rpL8 gene spans 1229 nucleotides, and contains three exons measuring 73, 150, and 648 nucleotides. The first intron is 293 nucleotides long and interrupts an 85-nucleotide untranslated leader sequence. The AUG codon is located 12 nucleotides downstream of the 5'-end of the second exon. Separating the second and third exon is a 65-nucleotide intron. The major transcription initiation site, identified by primer extension and polymerase stop reactions, mapped 378 nucleotides upstream from the AUG start codon; minor initiation sites were also detected.

10575541;Induction of globin synthesis in K562 cells is associated with differential expression of transcription factor genes.;Globin gene switching may be mediated by proteins expressed during different stages of development. Their identification may clarify the mechanisms of the conversion from fetal to adult globin production and lead to new approaches to reversing or retarding the gamma- to beta-globin gene switch. To explore this hypothesis, K562 erythroleukemia cells were induced to differentiate with 1.25, 2.5, and 5 mM sodium butyrate and gene expression was studied after 24, 48, and 72 h. Erythroid differentiation was verified by benzidine staining and by measuring the activity of a transduced A gamma-globin gene promoter linked to a luciferase reporter gene. Using differential display polymerase chain reaction (PCR), total mRNA extracted from induced cells at each time point of induction was reverse transcribed in the presence of A, G, and C anchored primers and 16 arbitrary primers, calculated to amplify approximately 50% of expressed genes. Amplified mRNAs from induced and uninduced cells were separated in polyacrylamide gels and compared. More than 110 cDNA fragments which appeared to represent either up- or downregulated mRNA species in induced K562 cells were identified. Sixty-four of these fragments had more than 95% homology to known GenBank sequences. Seventeen fragments with characteristics of transcription factors were cloned. These include differentiation-related gene-1 (drg-1), PAX 3/forkhead transcription factor, HZF2 which is a Kruppel-related zinc finger protein, three helix-loop-helix proteins (heir-1, Id3, and GOS8), alpha-NAC transcriptional coactivator, LIM domain protein, and trophoblast hypoxia regulating factor. Differential expression of all 17 fragments over 72 h was confirmed by reverse Northern dot blot analysis, semiquantitative PCR using nested primers, and Northern analysis. Erythroid maturation in induced K562 cells is associated with differential expression of numerous genes. Some encode transcription factors that could effect the initiation of HbF synthesis. Almost half of the differentially expressed clones contained cDNAs of unidentified open reading frames and these are the object of continued study.;-;zinc finger;polyacrylamide;hard_3
2775249;Isolation and some properties of a cathepsin E type proteinase from rat spleen.;Cathepsin E (EC 3.4.23.--) has been isolated from rat spleen.

The latter is reported in the literature to be the Mr of native cathepsin E. The enzyme dissociates under reducing conditions in two identical monomers. In our preparation a mechanism different from reduction must be active producing the 42 kDa polypeptide. This enzyme was hard to distinguish from cathepsin D (EC 3.4.23.5.) which shows similar properties such as size, substrate specificity, stability in 6 M urea, and dependence of the activity on pH.

207606;Regulation of cholesterol metabolism in rat adrenal mitochondria.;Addition of cholesterol to rat adrenal mitochondria resulted in a stimulation of pregnenolone synthesis. The slow step of the mitochondrial cholesterol side-chain cleavage reaction could be the interaction of the sterol with cytochrome P-450. The rate of cholesterol binding to this enzyme as observed spectroscopically correlated with the equilibration period (20 min) of the mitochondria and exogenous cholesterol required for maximal rates of pregnenolone synthesis. It is suggested that translocation of cholesterol between different sterol pools occurs within the mitochondria. Potential intracellular effectors that could be of importance in the movement or regulation of mitochondrial cholesterol include bivalent metallic ions, prostaglandins, cyclic nucleotides, polyamines and polylysine. Of the effectors studied, only calcium ions and polylysine markedly stimulated pregnenolone synthesis. These effectors might stimulate steroidogenesis by lateral displacement of cholesterol in the mitochondrial membrane into a compartment easily accessible to the cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme complex.;lysine;-;-;LCR_without_function
8896569;Germline mutations of the RET ligand GDNF are not sufficient to cause Hirschsprung disease.;Hirschsprung disease (HSCR, aganglionic megacolon) is a common congenital malformation leading to bowel obstruction, with an incidence of 1/5,000 live births. It is characterized by the absence of intrinsic ganglion cells in the myenteric and submucosal plexuses along variable lengths of the gastrointestinal tract. As enteric neurons are derived from the vagal neural crest, HSCR is regarded as a neurocristopathy. On the basis of a skewed sex-ratio (M/F = 4/1) and a risk to relatives much higher than the incidence in the general population, HSCR has long been regarded as a sex-modified multifactorial disorder. Accordingly, segregation analysis suggested an incompletely penetrant dominant inheritance in HSCR families with aganglionosis extending beyond the sigmoid colon. We and others have mapped a dominant gene for HSCR to chromosome 10q11.2 and have ascribed the disease to mutations in the RET proto-oncogene. However, the lack of genotype-phenotype correlation, the low penetrance and the sex-dependent effect of RET mutations supported the existence of one or more modifier gene(s) in familial HSCR. In addition, thus far, RET mutations only accounted for 50% and 15-20% of familial and sporadic HSCR patients, respectively. RET encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor whose ligand was unknown. Recently, the Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has been identified to be a ligand for RET. Moreover, Gdnf-/- knockout mutant mice display congenital intestinal aganglionosis and renal agenesis, a phenotype very similar to the Ret-/- mouse. These data prompted us to hypothesize that mutations of the gene encoding GDNF could either cause or modulate the HSCR phenotype in some cases.;-;-;-;hard_0
497212;Mechanism of inhibition of hepatic protein synthesis in rats by the carcinogen, methylazoxymethanol acetate.;Treatment of rats with the carcinogen, methylazoxymethanol acetate, results in a rapid, marked inhibition of hepatic protein synthesis and disaggregation of polysomes. Studies were undertaken to learn the mechanism by which this carcinogen induces these effects in rat liver. The data show that the inhibition of endogenous protein synthesis is not due to an effect on the high speed supernatant 'factors' but rather at the level of the polysome, and that both free and membrane-bound polysomes are affected. Poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis by native ribosomal subunits is greater in preparations isolated from rats treated with carcinogen than it is in controls. Moreover, the native ribosomal subunit fraction from treated livers in response to added rabbit globin mRNA is able to synthesize a protein similar in molecular weight to globin. These studies show that methylazoxymethanol acetate does not induce significant alterations of ribosomal subunits or of initiation factors and suggest that the inhibition of protein synthesis and disaggregation of polysomes may be the results of an alteration of cytoplasmic mRNA, or its association with ribosomes.;phenylalanine;-;-;LCR_without_function
10171173;Cardiopulmonary bypass.;There has been a recent renewed interest in certain aspects of cardiopulmonary bypass employing extracorporeal circulation.  Several areas have received special attention.  Among these is the institution of extracorporeal circulation using a percutaneous technique for circulatory assistance during high-risk percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.  A national registry has been established to review and monitor results using this percutaneous technique.  Several recent developments in the delivery of cardioplegia during ischemic arrest have stimulated investigative efforts.  In particular, the delivery of cardioplegia in a retrograde manner through the coronary sinus has proved an effective and useful adjunct to myocardial protection during cardiopulmonary bypass with extracorporeal circulation.  A newer investigative technique employing only warm cardioplegia delivered primarily through the retrograde coronary sinus route seems to offer some promise in providing optimal myocardial protection while minimizing hemorrhagic complications and other cold-induced myocardial injury.  Because of concerns regarding blood transfusion-related communicable disease (eg, acquired immune deficiency syndrome and non-A, non-B hepatitis), there has been increasing research effort into postoperative hemorrhage related to cardiopulmonary bypass with extracorporeal circulation.  Specifically, various drugs that may serve as hemostatic adjuncts have been investigated extensively.  These drugs include aprotinin and desmopressin acetate.  Likewise, several studies have evaluated other drugs (mainly aspirin) that have a negative influence on postoperative hemostasis.  Additionally, there has been continued research interest in the activation of the inflammatory system during cardiopulmonary bypass.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS);-;-;-;hard_0
34466285;The whole-genome and expression profile analysis of WRKY and RGAs in Dactylis glomerata showed that DG6C02319.1 and DgWRKYs may cooperate in the immunity against rust.;Orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata) is one of the top four perennial forages worldwide and, despite its large economic advantages, often threatened by various environmental stresses. WRKY transcription factors (TFs) can regulate a variety of plant processes, widely participate in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses, and are one of the largest gene families in plants. WRKYs can usually bind W-box elements specifically. In this study, we identified a total of 93 DgWRKY genes and 281 RGAs, including 65, 169 and 47 nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeats (NBS-LRRs), leucine-rich repeats receptor-like protein kinases (LRR-RLKs), and leucine-rich repeats receptor-like proteins (LRR-RLPs), respectively. Through analyzing the expression of DgWRKY genes in orchardgrass under different environmental stresses, it was found that many DgWRKY genes were differentially expressed under heat, drought, submergence, and rust stress. In particular, it was found that the greatest number of genes were differentially expressed under rust infection. Consistently, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of all genes showed that 78 DgWRKY TFs were identified in the plant-pathogen interaction pathway, with 59 of them differentially expressed. Through cis-acting element prediction, 154 RGAs were found to contain W-box elements. Among them, DG6C02319.1 (a member of the LRR-RLK family) was identified as likely to interact with 14 DGWRKYs. Moreover, their expression levels in susceptible plants after rust inoculation were first up-regulated and then down-regulated, while those in the resistant plants were always up-regulated. In general, DgWRKYs responded to both biotic stress and abiotic stress. DgWRKYs and RGAs may synergistically respond to the response of orchardgrass to rust. This study provides meaningful insight into the molecular mechanisms of WRKY proteins in orchardgrass.;leucine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
1946372;The two-hybrid system: a method to identify and clone genes for proteins that interact with a protein of interest.;"We describe a method that detects proteins capable of interacting with a known protein and that results in the immediate availability of the cloned genes for these interacting proteins. Plasmids are constructed to encode two hybrid proteins. One hybrid consists of the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcriptional activator protein GAL4 fused to the known protein; the other hybrid consists of the GAL4 activation domain fused to protein sequences encoded by a library of yeast genomic DNA fragments. Interaction between the known protein and a protein encoded by one of the library plasmids leads to transcriptional activation of a reporter gene containing a binding site for GAL4. We used this method with the yeast SIR4 protein, which is involved in the transcriptional repression of yeast mating type information. (i) We used the two-hybrid system to demonstrate that SIR4 can form homodimers. (ii) A small domain consisting of the C terminus of SIR4 was shown to be sufficient to mediate this interaction. (iii) We screened a library to detect hybrid proteins that could interact with the SIR4 C-terminal domain and identified SIR4 from this library. This approach could be readily extended to mammalian proteins by the construction of appropriate cDNA libraries in the activation domain plasmid.";-;nucleic acid binding;-;hard_2
9610763;Binding and functional effects of transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3 on the proximal human lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase promoter.;Human lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) circulates in plasma bound to high density lipoproteins (HDL) and modulates the rate by which cholesteryl ester is transported to the liver. So far, little is known about the regulation of the expression of the LCAT gene. In this study we have defined the cis-elements, identified the trans-acting factors and demonstrated their functional effects and significance in determining transcriptional activity of the proximal LCAT promoter. Using deletion mutants having 5' variable ends (from nucleotides -72 to -27), we have identified the presence of two non-consensus GC-rich regions that stimulate transcription in HepG2 and HeLa cells. These regions designated sites A (-29 to -47) and B (-49 to -65) contain the CCTCC core sequence which in electromobility shift analysis is critical for the formation of two DNA-protein complexes designated I and II. Site-directed mutagenesis suggests that both sites are equally important in promoter activity, and that cooperative interactions between both sites are not required for activity. Electromobility shift and supershift experiments using oligonucleotides spanning sites A and B identified Sp1 and Sp3 as the transcription factors interacting at these sites. To determine the significance and functional effects that Sp1 and Sp3 have in regulating LCAT promoter activity, we performed transfection experiments in Drosophila SL-2 cells as they lack endogenous Sp1 and Sp3. Sp1 but not Sp3 activates the human LCAT promoter and when Sp1 is co-transfected along with Sp3, Sp3 functions as a dose-dependent repressor of Sp1-mediated activation. These findings indicate that Sp1 is capable of transactivating a reporter gene linked to the LCAT promoter containing Sp binding sites and suggests that the levels of Sp3 or the nuclear Sp1/Sp3 ratio may play an important role in determining the transcriptional activity of the LCAT promoter in vivo.;cysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
6809291;Bone acid phosphatase: tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase as a marker of osteoclast function.;Organ cultures of newborn mouse calvaria were used to test the hypothesis that tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase might serve as a biochemical marker for osteoclast function. When bone resorption was stimulated in vitro with either parathyroid hormone or 1,25(OH)2D3, there was a significant increase in both tartrate-resistant and tartrate-sensitivity acid phosphatase activity in the medium relative to cultured controls. Tartrate-resistant activity was localized histochemically primarily over the osteoclast and appeared as three distinct activity bands when electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels. The tartrate-sensitive activity was found primarily associated with bone cells other than the osteoclast using histochemical techniques, and was resolved into five bands on polyacrylamide gels. The results obtained from biochemical assays, histochemical observations, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis suggest that bone resorption in vitro results in the release of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase from osteoclasts and tartrate-sensitive acid phosphatase from other bone cells as well as osteoclasts. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatases of bone may be suitable biochemical probes for osteoclasts function, but it will be necessary to achieve further purification in order to develop analytical methods with sufficient sensitivity and specificity (e.g., immunochemical) to ensure precise localization and quantitation.;-;phosphatase activity;polyacrylamide;hard_3

Extensive sampling and testing of 18 of the 39 flocks disclosed A) that five flocks with negative culture recoveries from feathers and freshly voided feces had essentially no positive DS-SAC values, and B) that 13 flocks with positive culture recoveries from feathers and/or fresh feces all had positive DS-SAC values.";-;antigen;-;hard_2
357416;Identification of three genes controlling production of new outer membrane pore proteins in Escherichia coli K-12.;Escherichia coli K-12 strains carrying mutations in the ompB gene or double mutations in the tolF and par genes lack the major outer membrane proteins 1a and 1b. These strains are deficient in the transport of small hydrophylic compounds and are multiply colicin resistant. When revertants of these strains were sought, a number of extragenic pseudorevertants were obtained which produced new outer membrane proteins. These new proteins could be divided into three classes by differences in electrophoretic mobility on polyacrylamide gels, by differing specificities for transport of small molecules, and by the identification of three different genetic loci for genes controlling their production. These genetic loci are designated as nmpA (at approximately 82.5 min on the E. coli K-12 genetic map), nmpB (8.6 min), and nmpC (12 min). The new proteins produced in strains carrying nmpA, nmpB, or nmpC mutations did not cross-react with antiserum against a mixture of proteins 1a and 1b, or with antiserum against phage-directed protein 2. Production of the new membrane proteins restored sensitivity to some of the colicins.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
6268841;Nucleotide sequences of the mRNA's encoding the vesicular stomatitis virus N and NS proteins.;The complete nucleotide sequences of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) mRNA's encoding the N and NS proteins have been determined from the sequences of cDNA clones. The mRNA encoding the N protein is 1,326 nucleotides long, excluding polyadenylic acid. It contains an open reading frame for translation which extends from the 5'-proximal AUG codon to encode a protein of 422 amino acids. The N and mRNA is known to contain a major ribosome binding site at the 5'-proximal AUG codon and two other minor ribosome binding sites. These secondary sites have been located unambiguously at the second and third AUG codons in the N mRNA sequence. Translational initiation at these sites, if it in fact occurs, would result in synthesis of two small proteins in a second reading frame. The VSV and mrna encoding the NS protein is 815 nucleotides long, excluding polyadenylic acid, and encodes a protein of 222 amino acids. The predicted molecular weight of the NS protein (25,110) is approximately one-half of that predicted from the mobility of NS protein on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Deficiency of sodium dodecyl sulfate binding to a large negatively charged domain in the NS protein could explain this anomalous electrophoretic mobility.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
20225847;Influence of phosphocholine alkyl chain length on peptide-micelle interactions and micellar size and shape.;The interaction with biological membranes is of functional importance for many peptides and proteins. Structural studies on such membrane-bound biomacromolecules are often carried out in solutions containing small membrane-mimetic assemblies of detergent molecules. To investigate the influence of the hydrophobic chain length on the structure, diffusional and dynamical behavior of a peptide bound to micelles, we studied the binding of three peptides to n-phosphocholines with n ranging from 8 to 16. The peptides studied are the 15 residue antimicrobial peptide CM15, the 25-residue transmembrane helix 7 of yeast V-ATPase (TM7), and the 35-residue bacterial toxin LdrD. To keep the dimension of the peptide-membrane-mimetic assembly small, micelles are typically used when studying membrane-bound peptides and proteins, for example, by solution NMR spectroscopy. Since they are readily available in deuterated form most often sodium-dodecylsulfate (SDS) and dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) are used as the micelle-forming detergent. Using NMR, CD, and SAXS, we found that all phosphocholines studied form spherical micelles in the presence and absence of small bound peptides and the diameters of the micelles are basically unchanged upon peptide binding. The size of the peptide relative to the micelle determines to what extent the secondary structure can form. For small peptides (up to approximately 25 residues) the use of shorter chain phosphocholines is recommended for solution NMR studies due to the favorable spectral quality and since they are as well-structured as in DPC. In contrast, larger peptides are better structured in micelles formed by detergents with chain lengths longer than DPC.;-;helix;-;hard_2
2376909;[Assay of GBM antigen in urine and serum with an anti-human renal monoclonal antibody].;Using a monoclonal antibody (Mab-G3) recognizing glomerular basement membrane (GBM), we assayed GBM antigen (G3-Ag) in the urine and serum of renal disease patients by sandwich ELISA. The subjects included normal control (NOR), minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS), IgA nephropathy (IgA), membranous nephropathy (MN), membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) and chronic renal failure (CRF). The urine and serum was used as the material. With urinary G3-Ag, there were no statistically significant differences among the NOR, MCNS, IgA, MN, MPGN and CRF groups. Although no correlation was observed with proteinuria, hematuria, serum creatinine, serum beta 2 microglobulin and urinary NAG, urinary G3-Ag showed a significant (p less than 0.05) increase in excretion in the group of progressive CRF patients with s-Cr more than 1.0 mg/dl/month as compared to the stationary CRF group with s-Cr less than 1.0 mg/dl/month. Serum G3-Ag showed lower values in almost all cases, and there were no significant differences among the renal disease groups. The above findings led us to believe that the assay of urinary G3-Ag was useful in determining the degree of GBM disorder. It was also presumed that assay of renal antigens in urine and serum with the respective anti-human renal monoclonal antibodies could be a new tool in diagnosing renal diseases.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
8441400;Wnt-1-inducing factor-1: a novel G/C box-binding transcription factor regulating the expression of Wnt-1 during neuroectodermal differentiation.;The Wnt-1 proto-oncogene is essential for proper development of the midbrain and is expressed in a spatially and temporally restricted manner during central nervous system development in mice. In vitro, the gene is specifically transcribed during the retinoic acid (RA)-induced neuroectodermal differentiation of the P19 line of embryonal carcinoma cells. The P19 cells differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, and fibroblast-like cells when treated with RA. Treatment of the cells with dimethyl sulfoxide leads to differentiation along mesodermal lineages, including skeletal and cardiac muscle. We have used the P19 cell line to study the Wnt-1 promoter and identify and characterize the transcription factor(s) that regulates the differentiation-specific transcription of Wnt-1 in RA-treated P19 cultures. Transient-transfection assays have revealed that a 230-bp region comprising positions -278 to -47 of the 5' upstream Wnt-1 sequence was sufficient to direct RA-specific transcription. This promoter fragment was shown to contain a binding site for a nuclear factor that was not detected in undifferentiated P19 stem cells or their dimethyl sulfoxide-treated derivatives but was induced in differentiating RA-treated cells. This factor was termed Wnt-1-inducing factor-1 (WiF-1). DNase I footprinting analysis has identified the G/C-rich WiF-1 binding site, and UV cross-linking studies have shown that WiF-1 is a protein with an M(r) of 65,000. WiF-1 binding activity was also detected in postpubertal mouse testis, the only tissue that expresses Wnt-1 in adults. Site-directed mutations that inhibited WiF-1 binding to the Wnt-1 promoter concomitantly abolished the activity of the promoter in RA-treated P19 cells. The active WiF-1 protein was purified by DNA affinity chromatography. Our data suggest that WiF-1 is a novel G/C box-binding transcription factor and support a physiological role for WiF-1 in the developmentally regulated expression of Wnt-1.;cysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
10869477;Upregulation of the expression of Fas antigen and Fas ligand in a human submandibular gland ductal cell line by okadaic acid.;Fas receptor is a member of a superfamily of receptors characterized by cysteine-rich motifs in the extracellular domain of the molecule. Binding of Fas ligand to the receptor leads to receptor activation and the induction of intracellular signals that result in apoptotic cell death. In the present study, the expression of mRNA and proteins of Fas receptor and Fas ligand were examined in human submandibular gland ductal (HSG) cells treated with okadaic acid by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunoblot analysis. Six hundred and eighty-two bp of the PCR product of Fas receptor mRNA was detected in HSG cells and a protein with an estimated molecular weight of 58,000 was expressed in HSG cells. Treatment of HSG cells with an agonistic anti-Fas monoclonal antibody resulted in death of HSG cells, indicating that the functional Fas receptor protein is expressed in HSG cells. Fas receptor protein expression stimulated by okadaic acid was elevated in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with maximal expression at 20 nM and 48 h treatment. Fas ligand mRNA was also detected constitutively in HSG cells by RT-PCR. Okadaic acid stimulated the expression of Fas ligand protein in HSG cells in a time-dependent manner, while the expression of the ligand was low in untreated HSG cells. The molecular weight of Fas ligand was estimated as 68,000. An antagonistic anti-Fas ligand monoclonal antibody prevented okadaic acid-induced death in HSG cells in a dose-dependent fashion as determined by WST-1 assay. The results indicate that the expression of Fas receptor and ligand is regulated by protein phosphatase(s) sensitive to okadaic acid and is involved in okadaic acid-induced apoptosis in HSG cells. The results also suggest that the Fas receptor-ligand system might regulate apoptosis in HSG cells. ;cysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

288056;De novo biosynthesis of an enzymatically active precursor form of bovine pancreatic RNase.;The de novo biosynthesis of RNase (ribonucleate 3'-pyrimidino-oligonucleotidohydrolase, EC 3.1.4.22) was studied in a cell-free rabbit reticulocyte translation system using a polyadenylylated fraction of mRNA isolated from bovine pancreas. Analysis of the [35S]methionine-labeled translation products of pancreas mRNA by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated the presence of several proteins, one of which corresponded to 16,500 daltons, or approximately 2800 daltons greater than native RNase A. This protein was specifically precipitated from the mixture of products by anti-RNase antibodies. Partial sequence determination of the NH2-terminal region of the anti-RNase antibody-precipitable species indicated that it is a precursor form of RNase A with 25 additional amino acids on its NH2 terminus. The precursor nature of the protein was confirmed by demonstration that a mixture of RNase A and a glycosylated form of the enzyme, RNase B, is formed when translation of the mRNA is conducted in the presence of dog pancreas membranes. Assay of the putative precursor form of RNase for catalytic activity with polycytidylic acid as substrate indicated that the protein has a specific enzymatic activity identical to that of native RNase A.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
8866740;Clinical and biological markers for outcome in schizophrenia: a review of a longitudinal follow-up study in Uppsala schizophrenia research project.;"During a 10-year period, 120 drugfree DSM-III-R schizophrenic patients were consecutively and unselectively admitted to a ward for young psychotic patients and subjected to a battery of examinations including symptomatology, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-biochemistry, computed tomography (CT)-scan, neurophysiologic and psychophysiologic (Electrodermal activity, EDA) parameters before antipsychotic treatment was initiated. After discharge, the patients were longitudinally followed with ratings of outcome (Strauss-Carpenters outcome scale) at years 1, 3, and 5 after index admission. The aim of the study was to find possible early markers for outcome in schizophrenia. At 5 years, 30% of the patients had a good outcome (total score > 13) and 15% a poor outcome (total score < 8). Poor premorbid adjustment and low level of education as well as negative schizophrenic symptomatology at index admission were associated with a poor outcome 5 years later. Positive symptomatology and a family history of schizophrenia did not predict outcome. Patients with a poor outcome (total score < 8) had a significantly more deviant CSF HVA/5-HIAA quotient than those with a very good outcome (total score > 15) as compared with healthy controls. Further, the CSF-peptides neuropeptide Y, dynorphin A, and CRF were predictable for outcome at the 5-year follow-up evaluation. Male schizophrenics who were ""nonresponders"" on the EDA test showed an almost 100% poor outcome, which was not found in females. In summary, several clinical and biological variables seem to have a predictable value for outcome in schizophrenia and, early identification of them might be a challenge for our future treatment strategies.";-;-;-;hard_0
11438649;Self-association of CIITA and its transactivation potential.;The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II transactivator (CIITA) regulates the expression of genes involved in the immune response, including MHC class II genes and the interleukin-4 gene. Interactions between CIITA and sequence-specific, DNA-binding proteins are required for CIITA to function as an activator of MHC class II genes. CIITA also interacts with the coactivators CBP (also called p300), and this interaction leads to synergistic activation of MHC class II promoters. Here, we report that CIITA forms complexes with itself and that a central region, including the GTP-binding domain is sufficient for self-association. Additionally, this central region interacts with the C-terminal leucine-rich repeat as well as the N-terminal acidic domain. LXXLL motifs residing in the GTP-binding domain are essential for self-association. Finally, distinct differences exist among various CIITA mutant proteins with regard to activation function, subcellular localization, and association with wild-type protein and dominant-negative potential. ;leucine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
15858016;Sequence variability, gene structure, and expression of full-length human endogenous retrovirus H.;"Recently, we identified and classified 926 human endogenous retrovirus H (HERV-H)-like proviruses in the human genome. In this paper, we used the information to, in silico, reconstruct a putative ancestral HERV-H. A calculated consensus sequence was nearly open in all genes. A few manual adjustments resulted in a putative 9-kb HERV-H provirus with open reading frames (ORFs) in gag, pro, pol, and env. Long terminal repeats (LTRs) differed by 1.1%, indicating proximity to an integration event. The gag ORF was extended upstream of the normal myristylation start site. There was a long leader (including a ""pre-gag"" ORF) region positioned like the N terminus of murine leukemia virus (MLV) ""glyco-Gag,"" potentially encoding a proline- and serine-rich domain remotely similar to MLV pp12. Another ORF, starting inside the 5' LTR, had no obvious similarity to known protein domains. Unlike other hitherto described gammaretroviruses, the reconstructed Gag had two zinc finger motifs. Alternative splicing of sequences related to the HERV-H consensus was confirmed using dbEST data. env transcripts were most prevalent in colon tumors, but also in normal testis. We found no evidence for full length env transcripts in the dbEST. HERV-H had a markedly skewed nucleotide composition, disfavoring guanine and favoring cytidine. We conclude that the HERV-H consensus shared a gene arrangement common to gammaretroviruses with gag separated by stop codon from pro-pol in the same reading frame, while env resides in another reading frame. There was also alternative splicing. HERV-H consensus yielded new insights in gammaretroviral evolution and will be useful as a model in studies on expression and function.

6284876;Characterization of infant rat cerebral cortical membrane proteins phosphorylated in vivo: identification of the ACTH-sensitive phosphoprotein B-50.;This study on the phosphorylation in vivo of membrane proteins in cerebral cortices of infant rats reports the identification of the adrenocorticotropin (ACTH)-sensitive phosphoprotein B-50 as one of the substrate proteins that are rapidly phosphorylated in vivo following intracisternal administration of 2 mCi [32P]orthophosphate. Rats were sacrificed 30 min after isotope injection. A fraction enriched in membranes, designated neural membranes (NM), was isolated from the cerebral cortices according to the procedure used for preparation of synaptic plasma membranes (SPM) from adult brain. This NM fraction was characterized by electron microscopy. The proteins of NM were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Numerous protein bands of NM in infant rat brain were phosphorylated in vivo. Attention was focussed on the 32P-labeled protein bands in the molecular weight range of 47K-67K. In this region one phosphoprotein band (MW 48K) was more highly labeled than the other bands. The electrophoretic behavior of three of these labeled bands, designated a, c, and e (MW 48K, 55K, and 62K, respectively) was compared with that of protein bands that were phosphorylated in vitro in cerebral membranes isolated from noninjected infant rats. The effects of ACTH1-24 and cyclic AMP in the in vitro system were also studied to probe for the presence of specific membrane proteins known to be sensitive to these modulators. On incubation of NM with [gamma-32P)ATP in the presence and absence of ACTH1-24 in vitro, phosphorylation of a 48K protein band was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by the neuropeptide. Two-dimensional electrophoretic separation of NM proteins labeled in vivo indicated that the 48K band had an isoelectric point of 4.5, identical to that of the ACTH-sensitive B-50 protein previously identified. Cyclic AMP stimulated phosphorylation in vitro of two protein bands (MW 55K and 59K) in NM preparations. This result indicates that the in vivo labeled band c may correspond to the cyclic AMP-sensitive 55K protein, whereas phosphoprotein band e, labeled in vivo, appears to be different from the cyclic AMP-sensitive 59K protein band. These observations indicate that neural membranes isolated from infant rat cerebral cortices contain a variety of proteins that can be phosphorylated in vivo. Several of these, for example, the 48K protein band, have the properties of synaptic plasma membrane proteins of adult rat brain that have been characterized by their sensitivity to neuromodulators in endogenous phosphorylating systems in vitro.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
8595418;A new human gene from the Down syndrome critical region encodes a proline-rich protein highly expressed in fetal brain and heart.;Down syndrome is a major cause of mental retardation and congenital heart defects. While most of the affected individuals have three copies of chromosome 21, patients with partial trisomy 21 have also been described. These rare cases define a minimal region for the Down syndrome phenotype encompassing about 3 Mb around D21S55. By using a new method for the identification of coding sequences (Alu-splice PCR) we have identified a new gene, DSCR1, from region 21q22.1-q22.2. DSCR1 encodes a novel protein which has an acidic domain, a serine-proline motif, a putative DNA binding domain and a proline-rich region with the characteristics of a SH3 domain ligand. These features suggest that DSCR1 could be involved in transcriptional regulation and/or signal transduction. DSCR1 is highly expressed in human brain and heart, and increased expression in the brains of young rats compared with adults suggests a role for DSCR1 during central nervous system development. Structural characteristics, together with its particular expression in brain and heart, encourage us to suggest that the overexpression of DSCR1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of Down syndrome, in particular mental retardation and/or cardiac defects.;proline;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
4104253;Temperature-sensitive mutants of vesicular stomatitis virus: synthesis of virus-specific proteins.;"Viral proteins synthesized in L cells infected with temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of vesicular stomatitis (VS) virus at permissive (31 C) and nonpermissive (39 C) temperatures were compared by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Mutant ts 5, deficient in synthesis of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA(-)), failed to synthesize any of the five identifiable viral proteins at 39 C. Each of three RNA(+) mutants, representing three separate complementation groups, showed distinctive patterns of viral protein synthesis at nonpermissive temperature. Equivalent amounts of (3)H-amino acids were incorporated into the five viral proteins made in cells infected with RNA(+) mutant ts 45 at 31 and 39 C. Complete virions of ts 45 could be identified by electron microscopy of infected cells incubated at the nonpermissive temperature; the defect in ts 45 appeared to be due in part to greater thermolability of virions as compared with the wild-type. RNA(+) mutant ts 23 was deficient in synthesis of viral envelope protein S and failed to make detectable virions at the nonpermissive temperature. Infection of cells at 39 C with the third RNA(+) mutant, ts 52, resulted in synthesis of all five viral proteins, but the peak of radioactivity representing the viral membrane glycoprotein migrated more rapidly on gels than coelectrophoresed authentic virion (14)C-glycoprotein or viral (3)H-glycoprotein extracted from cells infected at 31 C. These data and results of experiments on incorporation of radioactive glucosamine suggest that the primary defect in mutant ts 52 at nonpermissive temperature is failure of glycosylation of the viral glycoprotein. The viral structural proteins made in cells infected with ts 52 at the nonpermissive temperature did not assemble into sedimentable components as they did at permissive temperature; this observation indicates failure of insertion of the nonglycosylated protein (G') into cell membrane. In support of this hypothesis was the finding that antiviral-antiferritin hybrid antibody did not detect VS viral antigen on the plasma membrane of L cells infected at 39 C with ts 52. In contrast, VS viral antigen localized in plasma membrane of L cells infected at 39 C with mutants ts 23 and ts 45 was readily detected by electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy.";-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3

The enzyme system has both guanylyltransferase and methyltransferase activities. The GTP:mRNA guanylyltransferase activity incorporates GMP into the 5' terminus via a 5'-5' triphosphate bond. The properties of this reaction are: (a) of the four nucleoside triphosphates only GTP is a donor, (b) mRNA with two phosphates at the 5' terminus is an acceptor while RNA with a single 5'-terminal phosphate is not, (c) Mg2+ is required, (d) the pH optimum is 7.8, (e) PP1 is a strong inhibitor, and (f) the reverse reaction, namely the formation of GTP from PP1 and RNA containing the 5'-terminal structure G(5')pppN-, readily occurs. The S-adenosylmethionine:mRNA(guanine-7-)methyltransferase activity catalyzes the methylation of the 5'-terminal guanosine. This reaction exhibits the following characteristics: (a) mRNA with the 5'-terminal sequences G(5')pppA- and G(5')pppG- are acceptors, (b) only position 7 of the terminal guanosine is methylated; internal or conventional 5'-terminal guanosine residues are not methylated, (c) the reaction is not dependent upon GTP or divalent cations, (d) optimal activity is observed in a broad pH range around neutrality, (e) the reaction is inhibited by S-adenosylhomocysteine.

8538061;[Effect of physical activity on physical fitness among workers].;We conducted a cross-sectional study to clarify the effects of physical activity on physical fitness. Physical fitness tests were offered to workers of companies manufacturing automobile parts from December, 1992 to December, 1993. The subjects were 1,217 male and 600 female workers who participated in the physical fitness test. From this group, we analyzed 1,048 male and 522 female workers who answered a physical activity questionnaire. The questionnaire included age, sex, working posture, physical activity during working time and physical activity during leisure time. The physical fitness tests were composed of grip strength, standing trunk flexion, foot balance with closed eyes, jumping reaction time and step tests. We classified the subjects into low performance group and high performance group for each test. In addition, we classified the subjects into different groups by age (16-29 years old, 30-49 years old old and 50-69 years old), by working posture (standing and sitting), as well as by activity levels during working time and leisure time physical activities (inactive and active). Thus, we examined potential risk factors for the physical fitness by a multiple logistic regression model. The results were as follows: 1. Standing work was a significant risk factor for grip strength, foot balance with closed eyes and jumping reaction time in male workers, and standing trunk flexion, foot balance with closed eyes, jumping reaction time and the step test in female workers. 2. Physical activity during working time was not related to physical fitness in male and female workers. 3. Inactivity during leisure time was a significant risk factor for standing trunk flexion, foot balance with closed eyes, jumping reaction time and the step test in male workers, and grip strength and foot balance with closed eyes in female workers. 4. Young age (16-29 years old) was a significant risk factor for grip strength, standing trunk flexion, foot balance with closed eyes, jumping reaction time and the step test in male and female workers. Middle age (30-49 years old) was a significant risk factor for foot balance with closed eyes and jumping reaction time in male workers, and standing trunk flexion, foot balance with closed eyes, jumping reaction time and the step test in female workers.;-;-;-;hard_0

All four antibodies were of IgM isotype. These antibodies reacted against eight antigen preparations from three different strains of A. fumigatus by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Only two of four antibodies reacted with the antigens in crossed immunoelectrophoresis (CIE), rocket immunoelectrophoresis, and agar gel double diffusion. In western blot analysis it was found that the antigenic components reacting with the monoclonal antibodies were mostly of the low molecular weight components of A. fumigatus antigens. These components also showed binding to both IgG and IgE antibodies in the sera of ABPA patients, but failed to show any reactivity with sera from aspergilloma patients. Hence these antigenic components may be of diagnostic significance and can be isolated using immunoaffinity chromatography.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
35128378;Conformational switches that control the TEC kinase - PLCγ signaling axis.;Cell surface receptors such as the T-cell receptor (TCR) and B-cell receptor (BCR) engage with external stimuli to transmit information into the cell and initiate a cascade of signaling events that lead to gene expression that drives the immune response. At the heart of controlling T- and B-cell cell signaling, phospholipase Cγ hydrolyzes membrane associated PIP2, leading to generation of the second messengers IP3 and DAG. These small molecules trigger mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ and promote transcription factor transport into the nucleus launching the adaptive immune response. The TEC family kinases are responsible for phosphorylating and activating PLCγ, and our group aims to understand mechanisms that regulate immune cell signal transduction by focusing on this kinase/phospholipase axis in T-cells and B-cells. Here, we review the current molecular level understanding of how the TEC kinases (ITK and BTK) and PLCγ1/2 are autoinhibited prior to activation of cell surface receptors, how TEC kinases are activated to specifically recognize the PLCγ substrate, and how conformational changes induced by phosphorylation trigger PLCγ activation.;-;transcription factor;-;hard_2

This polypeptide, designated ""super protein"" (SuP), is the most prominent species among methionine-labeled proteins conveyed by rapid axonal transport in mature CNS and PNS neurons of warm- and cold-blooded vertebrates. We show here that SuP is identical to SNAP-25, a highly conserved synaptic protein of known primary structure, by immunoprecipitation with anti-SNAP-25 antiserum of SuP labeled with 35S-methionine and transported by retinal ganglion cells of rat and cat. In addition, we show that SNAP-25/SuP is the most prominent species among retinal polypeptides that incorporate 3H-palmitate in vivo, that it is fatty acylated through a hydroxylamine-labile, thioester bond, and that palmitoylated SNAP-25/SuP is axonally transported. Thus, SNAP-25/SuP is a rapidly transported constituent of the presynaptic apparatus and a major neuronal substrate for long-chain fatty acylation.";methionine;-;-;LCR_without_function
10747034;Suppression of post-transcriptional gene silencing by a plant viral protein localized in the nucleus.;Post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) is a homology-dependent RNA degradation process that may target RNA exclusively in the cytoplasm. In plants, PTGS functions as a natural defense mechanism against viruses. We reported previously that the 2b protein encoded by cucumber mosaic cucumovirus (CMV) is a virulence determinant and a suppressor of PTGS initiation in transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana. By fusion with the green fluorescent protein, we now show that the CMV 2b protein localizes to the nuclei of tobacco suspension cells and whole plants via an arginine-rich nuclear localization signal, (22)KRRRRR(27). We further demonstrate that the nuclear targeting of the 2b protein is required for the efficient suppression of PTGS, indicating that PTGS may be blocked in the nucleus. In addition, our data indicate that the PTGS suppressor activity is important, but not sufficient, for virulence determination by the 2b protein.;arginine;-;-;LCR_without_function
9394383;Orofacial pain with vascular-type features.;"OBJECTIVE
To examine whether a classifiable primary vascular-type craniofacial pain subgroup exists that predominantly affects intraoral structures.


STUDY DESIGN
Fifty-five patients were chosen prospectively according to the following inclusion criteria; periodic craniofacial pain that was unilateral, pulsatile, severe, and that may wake the patient from sleep. Accompanying phenomena could include local autonomic and/or systemic signs. Twenty-six cases could be further classified into one of the categories of vascular craniofacial pain. The remaining 29, all with predominantly intraoral pain, were not readily classifiable.


RESULTS
Of the 29 patients 70% were women, with an average onset-age of 42.6 years. All reported severe, episodic pain that was usually unilateral and lasted minutes to hours. In all, 55% of patients had autonomic or systemic signs, 48% had pulsatile pain, and 35.4% of patients were awakened by the pain.

277440;DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activities in hepatopancreas nuclei from Mytilus galloprovincialis Lamarck.;It has been shown that RNA synthesis in isolated hepatopancreas nuclei from Mytilus galloprovincialis is catalyzed by three DNA-dependent RNA polymerases (I, II and III) which resemble those identified in nuclei from mammalian cells. RNA polymerase I is active at 50 mM (NH4)2SO4, catalyzes the synthesis of GMP-rich ribosomal-like RNA and is completely resistant to the toadstool toxin alpha-amanitin. RNA polymerase II and III are active at higher (NH4)2SO4 concentrations, catalyze the synthesis of DNA-like RNA and are inhibited by very low (0.5-1 microgram/ml) and high (200 microgram/ml) concentrations of alpha-amanitin, respectively. Hepatopancreas nuclei retain considerable RNAase activity. Nuclear RNA polymerase activity may be underestimated since a part of the synthetized RNA is degraded.;proline;-;-;LCR_without_function
18827270;Divergent ependymal tumor (ependymoblastoma/anaplastic ependymoma) of the posterior fossa: an uncommon case observed in a child.;We report a divergent ependymal tumor of the posterior fossa (ependymoblastoma/anaplastic ependymoma) observed in an 8-year-old boy. The tumor showed the histological pattern typical of an ependymoblastoma (tubular-papillary fetaloid architecture with stratification of the tumor cells) next to areas in which findings typical of an anaplastic ependymoma were detected. The immunohistochemical study confirmed our diagnostic suspicion, allowing us to establish a differential diagnosis with other entities such as medulloblastoma, medulloepithelioma, atypical rhabdoid/teratoid tumor, or metastases.;-;-;-;hard_0
1720123;Discrete nuclear domains of poly(A) RNA and their relationship to the functional organization of the nucleus.;"The functional organization of the nucleus was studied using a fluorescence microscopy approach which allowed integration of positional information for RNA, DNA, and proteins. In cells from sea urchin to human, nuclear poly(A) RNA was found concentrated primarily within several discrete ""transcript domains"" which often surrounded nucleoli. Concentrations of poly(A) RNA were coincident with snRNP antigen clusters, providing evidence for the localization of pre-mRNA splicing at these sites. The spatial relationship of transcript domains with respect to various classes of DNA was established, in that the poly(A) RNA-rich regions coincided with discrete regions of low DNA density and were non-randomly distributed with respect to specific DNA sequences. Centromeric DNA and late-replicating DNA did not overlap transcript domains, whereas a subset of early-replicating DNA may. Results indicate that transcript domains do not result directly from a simple clustering of chromatin corresponding to metaphase chromosomes bands. Finally, observations on the reassembly of these domains after mitosis suggest that the clustering of snRNP antigens may be dependent on the reappearance of pol II transcription. Implications of these findings for overall nuclear structure and function are considered, including a discussion of whether transcript domains may be sites of polymerase II transcription reflecting a clustering of active genes.";alanine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
33243558;Protein solubility, secondary structure and microstructure changes in two types of undenatured type II collagen under different gastrointestinal digestion conditions.;Sodium dodecyl sulfonate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) were used to analyze the structural properties and gastrointestinal digestive characteristics of natural insoluble undenatured type II collagen (IC II) and pepsin soluble undenatured type II collagen (SC II). Results showed that, after gastric digestion, especially under low pH conditions, some thick and short collagen fibers were dissolved from IC II, which was accompanied by the release of soluble protein with triple helix structure. As to SC II, when gastric digestion was performed under higher pH conditions, collagen fibers were mildly thinned and curved, and the triple helix structure was slightly destroyed. However, those changes hardly occurred during the intestinal digestion. Moreover, the undenatured type II collagen existing in SC II digestive supernatant was 1.2-12.4 times higher than that of IC II depending on the pH conditions. These results suggested that, it is more likely for SC II to exert its activity of relieving arthritis, and it should be taken when the pH of gastric environment is high.;-;helix;polyacrylamide;hard_3
1982061;Characterization of the 5' end of the growth-regulated Syrian hamster CAD gene.;The carbamoylphosphate synthetase-aspartate transcarbamylase-dihydroorotase (CAD) gene encodes a tri-functional protein catalyzing the first three steps in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. Studies correlating CAD gene expression with cellular proliferation indicate the importance of understanding the regulation of the CAD gene. As a first step, the structure of the promoter region of the Syrian hamster CAD gene has been determined. Sequence analysis of 1671 base pairs of DNA revealed that the CAD promoter region is very GC rich. Primer extension analysis indicated that the transcription initiation site of the CAD gene is downstream from two GC boxes (consensus binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1). There is no TATA box appropriately spaced upstream from the transcription initiation site. Using RNase protection mapping, S1 nuclease analysis, and comparison to consensus splice donor/acceptor sites, the 5' end of the CAD gene has been determined to consist of a 241-base pair first exon, a 187-base pair first intron, a 140-base pair second exon, and a second intron that extends at least three kilobase pairs. Using conditions optimized for this GC-rich promoter, accurate transcription can be achieved in vitro. Analysis of CAD promoter deletions indicated that sequences extending only 114 base pairs upstream and 225 base pairs downstream from the transcription initiation site are sufficient for accurate and efficient transcription in vitro. DNase I footprinting reactions using this promoter fragment have identified three regions that bind proteins in a HeLa nuclear extract.;cysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
303918;Hairy-cell leukemia with T-cell features.;A case of clinically and hematologically typical hairy-cell leukemia has been presented in which, at the various times of testing, 52%-95% of peripheral blood and 73% of splenic mononuclear cells formed spontaneous sheep erythrocyte (E) rosettes. Many of the rosetting cells were shown to be typical morphologic hairy cells by light and electron microscopy. It was found that 70%-75% of peripheral blood mononuclear cells stained with an anti-T antiserum, and this antiserum also abolished E-rosette formation. A variable percentage of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was also shown to bear surface (IgDK) and internal (IgMK and IgGK) immunoglobulins. Additional B-cell features demonstrated included possession of the P29/34 la-like antigen and formation of mouse rosettes. It was demonstrated by a variety of blocking and inhibition studies that the E-rosette formation was not attributable to chance antigen specificity of the surface membrane immunoglobulin. These marker studies suggest that this is a case of true hybrid cell HCL. Despite these unusual marker characteristics, the patient showed no distinctive clinical or hematologic features.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
32820070;KSHV LANA acetylation-selective acidic domain reader sequence mediates virus persistence.;Viruses modulate biochemical cellular pathways to permit infection. A recently described mechanism mediates selective protein interactions between acidic domain readers and unacetylated, lysine-rich regions, opposite of bromodomain function. Kaposi´s sarcoma (KS)-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is tightly linked with KS, primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman's disease. KSHV latently infects cells, and its genome persists as a multicopy, extrachromosomal episome. During latency, KSHV expresses a small subset of genes, including the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA), which mediates viral episome persistence. Here we show that LANA contains two tandem, partially overlapping, acidic domain sequences homologous to the SET oncoprotein acidic domain reader. This domain selectively interacts with unacetylated p53, as evidenced by reduced LANA interaction after overexpression of CBP, which acetylates p53, or with an acetylation mimicking carboxyl-terminal domain p53 mutant. Conversely, the interaction of LANA with an acetylation-deficient p53 mutant is enhanced. Significantly, KSHV LANA mutants lacking the acidic domain reader sequence are deficient for establishment of latency and persistent infection. This deficiency was confirmed under physiological conditions, on infection of mice with a murine gammaherpesvirus 68 chimera expressing LANA, where the virus was highly deficient in establishing latent infection in germinal center B cells. Therefore, LANA's acidic domain reader is critical for viral latency. These results implicate an acetylation-dependent mechanism mediating KSHV persistence and expand the role of acidic domain readers.;lysine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
9093428;Immunoblot characterization of IgG, IgM and IgE antibodies elicited during the course of fatal and non-fatal infections of Plasmodium berghei in DBA/2 and Balb/c mice.;"When infected with the CRS line of Plasmodium berghei ANKA, DBA/2 mice died of a fulminating infection around day 20 post-infection whereas Balb/c mice had crises around day 15 then low or subpatent parasitaemias until approximately day 73, when sterile immunity is believed to have supervened. Immunoblots for parasite-specific immunoglobulins G, M and E were made from the sera taken during the course of infection in each mouse strain. Although both strains elicited antibodies to a 128-kDa antigen by day 8, this was solely of the IgG class in the DBA/2 but of both IgG and IgM in the Balb/c. Crisis and subpatency were associated with the appearance of IgG and IgM antibodies to 74- and 80-kDa antigens. The most vigorous immune response was observed in sera from the Balb/c mice on day 73, with antibodies to many antigens of 19-180 kDa; IgE antibody (to antigens of 38 and 45 kDa) was then evident for the first time.";-;antigen;-;hard_2
6203436;Gel electrophoresis in studies of protein conformation and folding.;Electrophoresis through polyacrylamide gels is a useful method for distinguishing conformational states of proteins and analyzing the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of transitions between conformations. Although the relationship between protein conformation and electrophoretic mobility is quite complex, relative mobilities provide qualitative estimates of compactness. Conformational states which interconvert slowly on the time scale of the electrophoretic separation can often be resolved, and the rates of interconversion can be estimated. If the transitions are more rapid, then the electrophoretic mobility represents the equilibrium distribution of conformations. Protein unfolding transitions induced by urea are readily studied using slab gels containing a gradient of urea concentration perpendicular to the direction of electrophoresis. Protein applied across the top of such a gel migrates in the presence of continuously varying urea concentrations, and a profile of the unfolding transition is generated directly. Transitions induced by other agents could be studied using analogous gradient gels. Electrophoretic methods are especially suited for studying small quantities of protein, and complex mixtures, since the different components can be separated during the electrophoresis.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
9169507;EGF receptor activation stimulates endogenous gastrin gene expression in canine G cells and human gastric cell cultures.;"Gastrin release from the antral gastrin-expressing cell (G cell) is regulated by bombesin and luminal factors. Yet, these same extracellular regulators do not stimulate expression of the gene. Since the gastric mucosa expresses large quantities of EGF receptor ligands such as TGFalpha, we examined whether EGF receptor ligands stimulate gastrin gene expression in gastrin-expressing cell cultures. EGF receptor activation of primary cultures stimulated gastrin gene expression about twofold; whereas bombesin treatment of antral G cell cultures stimulated gastrin release but not gene expression. EGF and TGFalpha were weak stimulants of gastrin release. EGF receptor activation of AGS human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line stimulated gastrin gene expression nearly fourfold; and gastrin reporter constructs transfected into AGS cells were stimulated more than fourfold by EGF. EGF induction was conferred by the previously defined GC-rich gastrin EGF response element (gERE) element located at -68 to -53 bp upstream from the cap site since a mutation of the gERE element abolished both basal and EGF induction. Moreover, EGF treatment of AGS cells stimulated binding of the transcription factor Sp1 to this element. Collectively, these results demonstrate that gastrin gene expression and gastrin release are regulated by different signaling pathways: gene expression by EGF receptor activation and gastrin secretion by neuropeptides and luminal factors.";cysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
2715809;Absence of collagen deficiency in familial cerebral aneurysms.;It has been suggested that a deficiency in the expression of type III collagen may play a role in the pathogenesis of cerebral aneurysms. To test this hypothesis in cases of familial cerebral aneurysms, fibroblast cell cultures were established and the expression of collagen types I and III was studied in a patient with three cerebral aneurysms whose mother and sister also had cerebral aneurysms. Cultured skin fibroblasts were labeled with tritiated proline. The collagens and procollagens were precipitated and run on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after reduction to analyze procollagen chains. Control cell lines were analyzed simultaneously. Quantitation of the ratios of type III to type I procollagen synthesis was achieved by integration of the intensities of the pro-alpha 1(III), pro-alpha 1(I), and pro-alpha 2(I) bands on fluorograms of electrophoretic gels of medium proteins. There was no difference in type I and III procollagen levels observed between the cells from the aneurysm patient and those from the control cell lines. These data do not support the hypothesis that familial cerebral aneurysms are caused by a deficiency of type III collagen.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
6260150;A new prolyl hydroxylase acting on poly-L-proline, from suspension cultured cells of Vinca rosea.;A new prolyl hydroxylase having a novel substrate specificity was isolated from the suspension-cultured cells of Vinca rosea. This enzyme was solubilized with 0.05 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.3 M NaCl and 0.5 mM beta-mercaptoethanol from the membrane fractions of the cells, and was partially purified by (NH4)2SO4 fractionation and DEAE-Sephadex A-50 column chromatography. The enzyme preparation was found to require O2, Fe2+, ascorbate, alpha-ketoglutarate and poly-L-proline to attain maximum activity. The plant enzyme does not hydroxylate free proline and di-, tri- and tetra-L-proline, but hydroxylates octa-L-proline and poly-L-proline (Mr greater than 2000). Model peptides of unhydroxylated collagen, (Pro-Pro-Gly)5 and (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 are poor substrates for the plant enzyme. This means that the plant enzyme has a novel substrate specificity in regard to peptidyl substrate, and this differs from vertebrate prolyl hydroxylase, proline,2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase (prolyl-glycyl-peptide, 2-oxoglutarate: oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.14.11.2).;-;-;poly-L-;hard_1

Whereas enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titers for healthy controls and patients with AIDS and MAC disease were comparable, human immunodeficiency virus-seronegative patients with MAC disease had higher anti-MAC antibody titers (P less than 0.01). Immunoblot analysis with the same sonic extracts indicated that each of the three groups had a limited heterogeneous response to M. avium antigens. No significant differences in immunoblot reactivities were detected. However, immunoblot studies with recombinant nontuberculous mycobacterial antigens revealed that sera from over 90% of the patients with MAC disease and only 25% of controls recognized a recombinant protein derived from a 35-kDa mycobacterial antigen. Although sonic extracts did not permit adequate discrimination of antibody reactivity in patients with MAC disease, recombinant antigens may be useful as indicators of disease.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
25055032;Proteomic characterization of acyclovir-induced nephrotoxicity in a mouse model.;Acyclovir (ACV) is an effective and widely used antiviral agent. However, its clinical application is limited by severe nephrotoxicity. We assessed ACV-induced nephrotoxicity and identified the differentially expressed proteins using mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. In total, 30 ICR mice were intraperitoneally administrated ACV (150 or 600 mg/kg per day) for 9 days. After administration of ACV, levels of serum creatinine and urea nitrogen increased significantly. In addition, mouse kidneys exhibited histopathological changes and reduced expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor VEGFR2. In the proteomic analysis, more than 1,000 proteins were separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and a total of 20 proteins were up- or down-regulated in the ACV group compared with the saline group. Among these, six proteins (MHC class II antigen, glyoxalase 1, peroxiredoxin 1, αB-crystallin, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1-IIIb, and cytochrome c oxidase subunit Vb) were identified in association with ACV-induced nephrotoxicity. These findings were confirmed by Western blotting analysis. The differential expression levels of α-BC, Prx1, Glo I and CcO Vb suggest that oxidative damage and mitochondrial injury may be involved in ACV-induced nephrotoxicity. Furthermore, VEGF and FGF may play a role in tissue repair and the restoration process following ACV nephrotoxicity.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
3334704;Expression and characterization of hepatitis B virus precore-core antigen in E. coli.;The hepatitis B virus core antigen, including the precore sequence (HBcAg-p25), was expressed at very high levels in bacteria.

The relative amount of HBcAg-p25 polypeptide expressed by the different vectors was estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot. HBcAg-p25 was associated with an insoluble fraction of bacterial extracts and required ionic detergents for solubilization.

The purification procedure employed ammonium sulfate fractionation, Sepharose CL 6B gel filtration, chromatography on DEAE-cellulose to remove the interfering malate dehydrogenase, and affinity chromatography on 2',5'-ADP-Sepharose and NAD-agarose to take advantage of the dual coenzyme specificity. Antibody prepared from the purified enzyme produced a single peak upon cross-rocket immunoelectrophoresis against the mitochondrial sonicate. Continuous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed NAD and NADP activity co-migrating with the native protein band. A single band of protein having an apparent Mr = 62,000 was seen on sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis. At pH 7.3, gel filtration revealed a single peak of activity with NAD and NADP corresponding to an apparent Mr = 282,000. Gradient gel polyacrylamide electrophoresis at pH 9.0 indicated an additional broad band of activity corresponding to a Mr = 141,000. Under physiological conditions therefore the protein appears to exist as a tetramer of Mr = 282,000 composed of four equal subunits, whereas at elevated pH values during electrophoresis, partial dissociation to a dimeric species occurs.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1

To our knowledge, this protein was not previously known to be associated with melanoma cells. The identity of the protein was confirmed by two-dimensional immunoblot analysis. High-energy collision-induced dissociation analysis revealed the sequence and acetylation of the N-terminal tryptic peptide and an acrylamide-modified cysteine in another tryptic peptide.

8392799;cAMP levels in fast- and slow-twitch skeletal muscle after an acute bout of aerobic exercise.;"The present study examined whether exercise duration was associated with elevated and/or sustained elevations of postexercise adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) by measuring cAMP levels in skeletal muscle for up to 4 h after acute exercise bouts of durations that are known to either produce (60 min) or not produce (10 min) mitochondrial proliferation after chronic training. Treadmill-acclimatized, but untrained, rats were run at 22 m/min for 0 (control), 10, or 60 min and were killed at various postexercise (0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h) time points. Fast-twitch white and red (quadriceps) and slow-twitch (soleus) muscles were quickly excised, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and assayed for cAMP with a commercial kit. Unexpectedly, cAMP contents in all three muscles were similar to control (nonexercise) at most (21 of 30) time points after a single 10- or 60-min run. Values at 9 of 30 time points were significantly different from control (P < 0.05); i.e., 3 time points were significantly higher than control and 6 were significantly less than control.

A dCp4-Sepharose column effects a one-step, 19,000-fold, purification to homogeneity of dCyd kinase from the ammonium sulfate fraction of Lactobacillus acidophilus R-26 extract, with 60% recovery. dCTP, a potent end-product inhibitor, is used as an eluent, and it also stabilizes the extremely labile purified enzyme. A noncompeting deoxyadenosine kinase activity accompanies the deoxycytidine kinase activity eluted. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis shows a single protein band, which coincides with both deoxycytidine kinase and deoxyadenosine kinase activities at several gel concentrations. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reveals a single polypeptide band of 26,000 daltons. Since the native enzyme is known to have an Mr of 50,000, it appears that the enzyme is composed of two subunits of similar size. Sequence analysis of the intact protein from the N-terminus reveals but a single amino acid species per residue up to the 17th residue; at the 18th, 21st, 26th, and 27th residue positions of the sequence, however, there appear to be two different amino acids in almost equal amounts. This may indicate that the enzyme is composed of two nonidentical subunits having the same amino acid sequence near the N-terminus.

21832157;A novel function of Tis11b/BRF1 as a regulator of Dll4 mRNA 3'-end processing.;Tis11b/BRF1 belongs to the tristetraprolin family, the members of which are involved in AU-rich-dependent regulation of mRNA stability/degradation. Mouse inactivation of the Tis11b gene has revealed disorganization of the vascular network and up-regulation of the proangiogenic factor VEGF. However, the VEGF deregulation alone cannot explain the phenotype of Tis11b knockouts. Therefore we investigated the role of Tis11b in expression of Dll4, another angiogenic gene for which haploinsufficiency is lethal. In this paper, we show that Tis11b silencing in endothelial cells leads to up-regulation of Dll4 protein and mRNA expressions, indicating that Dll4 is a physiological target of Tis11b. Tis11b protein binds to endogenous Dll4 mRNA, and represses mRNA expression without affecting its stability. In the Dll4 mRNA 3' untranslated region, we identified one particular AUUUA motif embedded in a weak noncanonical polyadenylation (poly(A)) signal as the major Tis11b-binding site. Moreover, we observed that inhibition of Tis11b expression changes the ratio between mRNAs that are cleaved or read through at the poly(A) signal position, suggesting that Tis11b can interfere with mRNA cleavage and poly(A) efficiency. Last, we report that this Tis11b-mediated mechanism is used by endothelial cells under hypoxia for controlling Dll4 mRNA levels. This work constitutes the first description of a new function for Tis11b in mammalian cell mRNA 3'-end maturation.;alanine;-;-;LCR_without_function

The purified preparation was homogeneous as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing on polyacrylamide gel. The isoelectric point was at pH 4.85, and the apparent molecular weight of RnBP was estimated to be 42,000 by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The preparation did not show any renin activity and was stable for 30 min at 37 degrees C between pH 5.0 and 9.0 or on storage for 4 weeks at 4 degrees C or -80 degrees C. The activity of renin was greatly inhibited by RnBP. From the kinetic analysis of the inhibition we roughly estimated the dissociation constant between renin and RnBP to be about 0.2 nM, assuming that the stoichiometry in the complex, i.e., high molecular weight (HMW) renin, is one to one, and that the complex is inactive. The inhibitory activity of RnBP was lost by acidification at pH 3.0 and the activity of renin was restored. The purified RnBP formed a single precipitin line with the antiserum prepared with the purified HMW renin as antigen, which is RnBP-renin complex (Takahashi, S., et al. (1983) J. Biochem. 93, 265-274), and this line fused with one of the two precipitin lines formed between HMW renin and anti-HMW renin antiserum. The other of the two lines was between renin and anti-HMW renin antiserum. The purified preparation was thus identified as RnBP. The HMW renin was reconstituted with the purified RnBP and renin, and the apparent molecular weight of the reconstituted specimen was estimated to be 60,000 by gel filtration on Ultrogel AcA 44.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
8148416;Chronic neutrophilic leukemia. A study of four cases.;"Chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) is a very rare entity, which has to be included among the chronic myeloid leukemias. Once an underlying cause of neutrophilia is excluded, the diagnosis of CNL is based on exclusion of chronic granulocytic and other types of chronic myeloid leukemias.

We report here four cases of CNL, with confirmed absence of bcr rearrangement in two cases. Two patients died, 12 and 8 years after diagnosis, the second one following transformation into myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia.

Distinct differences were detected between circular dichroism spectra of total chromatin and of its active fraction as well as between differential curves of the chromatin active fraction melting in control and test samples. The difference was expressed as a decrease in temperature of melting in a low-point zone and as appearance of the secondary maxima in the region of nucleosomes melting.

The addition of the detergent more than doubled the enzyme activity in the homogenates. The purified enzyme preparations from whole chick embryos showed one major band and two or three minor bands in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were entirely free of collagen galactosyltransferase activity. The molecular weight of collagen glucosyltransferase from both sources was about 52000 -- 54000, as determined by gel filtration. In some enzyme preparations an additional form was observed, with an elution position corresponding to a molecular weight of about 130000. Manganese was the most effective metal co-factor for the purified enzyme, but partial replacement could be obtained with Co2+, Mg2+ and Ca2+, whereas no replacement was found with other metals. The activity of the purified enzyme was stimulated by the addition of dithiothreitol to the incubation system and inhibited by preincubation with p-mercuribenzoate. UDP-glucose or the collagen substrate partially protected the enzyme against p-mercuribenzoate inactivation in the presence of Mn2+ but not in its absence.

29780056;Potential roles of the poly(A)-binding proteins in translational regulation during spermatogenesis.;Spermatogenesis is briefly defined as the production of mature spermatozoa from spermatogonial stem cells at the end of a strictly regulated process. It is well known that, to a large extent, transcriptional activity ceases at mid-spermiogenesis. Several mRNAs transcribed during early stages of spermatogenesis are stored as ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). During the later stages, translational control of these mRNAs is mainly carried out in a time dependent-manner by poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) in cooperation with other RNA-binding proteins and translation-related factors. Conserved PABPs specifically bind to poly(A) tails at the 3' ends of mRNAs to regulate their translational activity in spermatogenic cells. Studies in this field have revealed that PABPs, particularly poly(A)-binding protein cytoplasmic 1 (Pabpc1), Pabpc2, and the embryonic poly(A)-binding protein (Epab), play roles in the translational regulation of mRNAs required at later stages of spermatogenesis. In this review article, we evaluated the spatial and temporal expression patterns and potential functions of these PABPs in spermatogenic cells during spermatogenesis. The probable relationship between alterations in PABP expression and the development of male infertility is also reviewed. ;alanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
27749929;Rabies Virus Infection Induces the Formation of Stress Granules Closely Connected to the Viral Factories.;Stress granules (SGs) are membrane-less dynamic structures consisting of mRNA and protein aggregates that form rapidly in response to a wide range of environmental cellular stresses and viral infections. They act as storage sites for translationally silenced mRNAs under stress conditions. During viral infection, SG formation results in the modulation of innate antiviral immune responses, and several viruses have the ability to either promote or prevent SG assembly. Here, we show that rabies virus (RABV) induces SG formation in infected cells, as revealed by the detection of SG-marker proteins Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1 (G3BP1), T-cell intracellular antigen 1 (TIA-1) and poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) in the RNA granules formed during viral infection. As shown by live cell imaging, RABV-induced SGs are highly dynamic structures that increase in number, grow in size by fusion events, and undergo assembly/disassembly cycles. Some SGs localize in close proximity to cytoplasmic viral factories, known as Negri bodies (NBs). Three dimensional reconstructions reveal that both structures remain distinct even when they are in close contact. In addition, viral mRNAs synthesized in NBs accumulate in the SGs during viral infection, revealing material exchange between both compartments. Although RABV-induced SG formation is not affected in MEFs lacking TIA-1, TIA-1 depletion promotes viral translation which results in an increase of viral replication indicating that TIA-1 has an antiviral effect. Inhibition of PKR expression significantly prevents RABV-SG formation and favors viral replication by increasing viral translation. This is correlated with a drastic inhibition of IFN-B gene expression indicating that SGs likely mediate an antiviral response which is however not sufficient to fully counteract RABV infection. ;-;antigen;-;hard_2

SRS-A has been purified in microgram quantities together with closely related material.

7836397;Identification of band 3-like proteins and Cl-/HCO3- exchange in isolated cardiomyocytes.;The identification of the protein that exerts the function of Cl-/HCO3- exchange is still unresolved in cardiac tissue. We have addressed this issue by using a multiple technical approach. Western blotting analysis with an antibody raised against human erythroid whole band 3 protein, the so-called protein that mediates the Cl-/HCO3- exchange in erythrocytes, showed that adult cardiomyocytes expressed two proteins immunologically related to the erythroid band 3. These proteins migrated in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with apparent molecular masses of 80 and 120 kDa. They were specifically found in the membrane but not in the cytosolic or the myofibril fractions of adult cardiomyocytes. Confocal microscopy further indicated that the immunostained proteins were mainly located at the sarcolemma and along T-tubules, typical membrane structures of adult cardiomyocytes. Using an antibody raised against a cardiac amino-terminal domain of rat AE3, we found that the 120-kDa protein is the translation product of the AE3 gene specifically expressed in heart and brain. Using an antiserum raised against a specific domain of mouse erythroid band 3 (AE1), which is not shared by AE3, we showed that the 80-kDa protein is likely to be a truncated translation product of the AE1 gene. Microinjection of the anti-human erythroid whole band 3 antibody into single isolated cardiac cells significantly inhibited the Cl-/HCO3- exchange activity. Furthermore, the anti-AE1 antibody strongly decreased the efficiency of 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate to inhibit the ionic exchange. We thus suggest that the 80-kDa or both the 80- and the 120-kDa proteins immunologically related to the erythroid band 3 protein perform the anionic exchange in rat cardiomyocytes.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1

The esterase patterns in F. hepatica and D. dendriticum were different. Homogenate of F. hepatica from both hosts gave four enzyme bands. For D. dendriticum, however, while homogenates of parasites from C. hircus also gave four bands, those of O. aries gave only three bands. Acid and alkaline phosphatases in homogenates of both parasites showed three enzyme bands, but there was a host species difference between the enzyme patterns of specimens collected from C. hircus versus O. aries.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
8153561;Directional hearing aid based on array technology.;The hearing impaired often have great difficulty understanding speech in surroundings with background noise or reverberation. A directional hearing aid might be beneficial in reducing background noise in relation to the desired speech signal. To this end microphone systems were developed with strongly directional characteristics, using array techniques. Considerable attention was paid to optimization and stability. Free-field simulations of several robust models showed that a directivity index of 9 dB can be obtained. Simulations were verified with a laboratory model. Based on simulations and measurements, two portable prototypes were developed and tested using a KEMAR-manikin. The KEMAR-measurements showed that the two prototypes gave an improvement of the signal to noise ratio of 7 dB in a fully diffuse sound field. The benefit of these microphone arrays for the hearing impaired was tested in a sound insulated room. One loudspeaker was placed in front of the listener simulating the partner in a discussion, and a diffuse background noise was produced by eight loudspeakers placed on the corners of a cube. The hearing impaired subject was seated in the centre of the cube. The speech-reception threshold in noise for simple Dutch sentences was determined with a normal single omni-directional microphone and with one of the prototypes. The results of the listening tests with 45 hearing impaired subjects showed an average improvement of the S/N-ratio of 7.0 dB for monaural fitting.;-;-;-;hard_0
6478483;Lymph node accessory cells in the immune response. The primary response to paratyphoid vaccine in rat parathymic lymph nodes.;"The immune response in the rat parathymic lymph node was studied after administration of antigen into the peritoneal cavity. Special attention was paid to the accessory cells, which might induce the response. During the induction phase of the response a heterogeneous population of non-lymphoid mononuclear cells was present in the subcapsular sinus and the cortex of the node. These cells resemble ""veiled cells"" described in skin draining lymph and interdigitating cells in the paracortex of skin draining lymph nodes, but they do not contain Birbeck granules. It is concluded that the appearance of these granules depends on the site of the exudate provocation and that the presence of the organelles in these accessory cells is not obligatory for lymphocyte stimulation.";-;antigen;-;hard_2
26322169;Role of ZAC1 in transient neonatal diabetes mellitus and glucose metabolism.;Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus 1 (TNDM1) is a rare genetic disorder representing with severe neonatal hyperglycaemia followed by remission within one and a half year and adolescent relapse with type 2 diabetes in half of the patients. Genetic defects in TNDM1 comprise uniparental isodisomy of chromosome 6, duplication of the minimal TNDM1 locus at 6q24, or relaxation of genomically imprinted ZAC1/HYMAI. Whereas the function of HYMAI, a non-coding mRNA, is still unidentified, biochemical and molecular studies show that zinc finger protein 1 regulating apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (ZAC1) behaves as a factor with versatile transcriptional functions dependent on binding to specific GC-rich DNA motives and interconnected regulation of recruited coactivator activities. Genome-wide expression profiling enabled the isolation of a number of Zac1 target genes known to regulate different aspects of ?-cell function and peripheral insulin sensitivity. Among these, upregulation of Ppar? and Tcf4 impairs insulin-secretion and ?-cell proliferation. Similarly, Zac1-mediated upregulation of Socs3 may attenuate ?-cell proliferation and survival by inhibition of growth factor signalling. Additionally, Zac1 directly represses Pac1 and Rasgrf1 with roles in insulin secretion and ?-cell proliferation. Collectively, concerted dysregulation of these target genes could contribute to the onset and course of TNDM1. Interestingly, Zac1 overexpression in ?-cells spares the effects of stimulatory G-protein signaling on insulin secretion and raises the prospect for tailored treatments in relapsed TNDM1 patients. Overall, these results suggest that progress on the molecular and cellular foundations of monogenetic forms of diabetes can advance personalized therapy in addition to deepening the understanding of insulin and glucose metabolism in general.  ;cysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
35566916;Application and Optimization of the Rheological Model for a Hydrophobically Associating Dendrimer Polymer.;Polymer flooding is one of the most important enhancing oil recovery (EOR) technologies in the world. With the optimization of polymer synthesis, the performance of polymer solutions has been greatly improved, which can adapt to more complex oil and gas reservoirs. However, with the continuous improvement of the properties of polymer solutions, the elastic property of polymer solutions is significantly improved, and the rheological law has also changed. This series of changes affects the application of polymer flooding reservoir numerical simulation technology. Therefore, constructing an accurate description model and precise limitation conditions is particularly important. The rheological curve with a wide shear range (0.1~10,000 s-1) and the viscoelasticity of the two polymers (partially hydrolysed polyacrylamide (HPAM) and dendritic hydrophobic association polymer (DHAP)) were analyzed and tested by a rotating rheometer. The results showed that under the experimental conditions, the rheological curve of both polymers can be described by the Carreau rheological model. Meanwhile, the structural viscosity of the hydrophobically associating polymer solution (DHAP) greatly improved the elasticity of the solution and led to the change of elastic modulus. Considering the influence of elastic characteristics on the rheological curve, the relaxation time spectrum derived from small vibration experimental data was used to limit the characteristic relaxation time, that is, the value range of λ. It was observed that the experimental data were highly matched with the nonlinear regression fitting curve of the Carreau rheological model. Therefore, the relationship between different test parameters should be fully considered while studying the rheological constitutive equation of viscoelastic fluid, so as to optimize and improve the equation of it.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
391558;Interaction of arginine with the ribosomal peptidyl transferase centre.;Arginine inhibits the formation of acetylleucyl-puromycin from C(U)-A-C-C-A-LeuAc and puromycin ('fragment reaction'), catalized by Escherichia coli and yeast ribosomes. From 18 different L-amino acids assayed, arginine was the most effective in producing inhibition (50% inhibition at 20 mM, with 1 mM puromycin). L-Argininamide and D-arginine gave about the same inhibition as L-arginine. The inhibition by L-arginine is competitive with respect to puromycin. The plot of the slopes obtained in a Lineweaver and Burk representation versus [Arg]2, and the plot of 1/v versus [Arg]2 at a fixed concentration of puromycin, are linear, which seems to indicate that two arginine molecules must interact at the puromycin binding site to produce inhibition. In addition to the 'fragment reaction', arginine inhibits the non-enzymatic binding of AcPhe-tRNA, C(U)-A-C-C-A-Leu and C(U)-A-C-C-A-LeuAc to ribosomes. However, it does not inhibit poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis or the reaction of puromycin with AcPhe-tRNA previously bound to the peptidyl site. The results agree with arginine binding to the acceptor site, and with a sequential mechanism for the 'fragment reaction', puromycin binding first.;phenylalanine;-;-;LCR_without_function
10826408;Blood pressure and metabolic changes during dietary L-arginine supplementation in humans.;"Dietary L-arginine supplementation has been proposed to reverse endothelial dysfunction in such diverse pathophysiologic conditions as hypercholesterolemia, coronary heart disease, and some forms of animal hypertension. In particular, chronic oral administration of L-arginine prevented the blood pressure rise induced by sodium chloride loading in salt-sensitive rats. To investigate the effects of L-arginine-rich diets on blood pressure and metabolic and coagulation parameters we performed a single-blind, controlled, crossover dietary intervention in six healthy volunteers. The subjects (aged 39+/-4 years, body mass index [BMI] 26+/-1 kg/m2, mean +/- SEM) received, in random sequence, three different isocaloric diets, each for a period of 1 week (Diet 1: control; Diet 2: L-arginine enriched by natural foods; Diet 3: identical to Diet 1 plus oral L-arginine supplement). Sodium intake was set at a constant level (about 180 mmol/day) throughout the three study periods. A blood pressure decrease was observed with both L-arginine-rich diets (Diet 2 v 1, SBP: -6.2 mm Hg [95% CI: -0.5 to -11.8], DBP: -5.0 mm Hg [-2.8 to -7.2]; Diet 3 v 1, SBP: -6.2 mm Hg [-1.8 to -10.5], DBP: -6.8 mm Hg [-3.0 to -10.6]). A slight increase in creatinine clearance (P = .07) and a fall in fasting blood glucose (P = .008) occurred after Diet 3 and, to a lesser extent, after Diet 2. Serum total cholesterol (P = .06) and triglyceride (P = .009) decreased and HDL cholesterol increased (P = .04) after Diet 2, but not after Diet 3. These results indicate that a moderate increase in L-arginine significantly lowered blood pressure and affected renal function and carbohydrate metabolism in healthy volunteers.";arginine;-;-;LCR_without_function
6891452;Species-specific defense reactions and avoidance learning. An evaluative review.;Bolles (1970) proposed a theory of avoidance learning, the species-specific defense reaction (SSDR) hypothesis, which emphasized innate constraints on the response repertoire of rats in aversive situations and minimized the role of reinforcement in avoidance learning. The present paper describes Bolles' (1970, 1971, 1972, 1975, 1978) development of SSDR theory and reviews the empirical tests of its assumptions and predictions. It is concluded that the SSDRs described by Bolles, along with some others, are highly probable in aversive situations but that the response repertoire is not limited to them. Further, there is strong evidence for reinforcement effects in the establishment and maintenance of at least some avoidance responses.;-;-;-;hard_0
6201191;Function of the repeating homologous sequences in nucleic acid binding domain of ribosomal protein S1.;Ribosomal protein S1 contains in its RNA binding domain four repeating, homologous stretches of sequences. Its functionally active mutant form m1-S1 [Subramanian, A.R., & Mizushima, S. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 4309] contains only three repeating stretches. In order to assess the functional importance of this repeating sequence, we cleaved S1 at its reactive SH group on Cys-349 and isolated a fragment (S1-F4) that has lost two of the homologous stretches but retains all other essential elements. We find that ribosomes reconstituted with S1-F4 instead of S1 are functionally active in translating poly(U) and poly(A) but totally inactive in translating phage MS2 RNA. The significance of this result is discussed vis-à-vis the initiation step in translating natural mRNA, and a functional role for the tetrarepeat of S1 is suggested.;alanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
17603493;Altered recognition of antigen is a mechanism of CD8+ T cell tolerance in cancer.;Antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell tolerance, induced by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), is one of the main mechanisms of tumor escape. Using in vivo models, we show here that MDSCs directly disrupt the binding of specific peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) dimers to CD8-expressing T cells through nitration of tyrosines in a T-cell receptor (TCR)-CD8 complex. This process makes CD8-expressing T cells unable to bind pMHC and to respond to the specific peptide, although they retain their ability to respond to nonspecific stimulation. Nitration of TCR-CD8 is induced by MDSCs through hyperproduction of reactive oxygen species and peroxynitrite during direct cell-cell contact. Molecular modeling suggests specific sites of nitration that might affect the conformational flexibility of TCR-CD8 and its interaction with pMHC. These data identify a previously unknown mechanism of T-cell tolerance in cancer that is also pertinent to many pathological conditions associated with accumulation of MDSCs.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
28774;Enzyme behaviour and molecular environment. The effects of ionic strength, detergents, linear polyanions and phospholipids on the pH profile of soluble cytochrome oxidase.;"The activity vs. pH profile for the oxidation of ferrocytochrome c by purified cytochrome oxidase (ferrocytochrome c:oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.9.3.1) was investigated as a function of ionic strength (from 10 to 200 mM) in the absence and in the presence of various perturbants: Tween 20, linear polyanions (RNA, heparin, polyglutamic acid) and phospholipids (asolectin, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidic acid and cardiolipin). The activation induced by Tween 20 and ""zero net charge"" phospholipid liposomes was not pH dependent. On the other hand, linear polyanions and polyanionic liposomes strongly perturbed the pH profile, mostly at low ionic strength, by shifting the pH optimum about 1.7 pH units towards alkaline pH values. This effect was reversed by increasing ionic strength. These observations are interpreted in the light of polyelectrolyte theory. Since these results show striking with membrane-bound enzyme, it is concluded that in vivo cytochrome oxidase is located within polyanionic sites of the micochondrial membrane. The activation broght about by phospholipids may result from two posible processes: creation of a hydrophobic environment by the non-polar tails, preventing autoaggregation; and creation of a suitable polyelectrolytic environment by the polar heads (of non zero net charge), increasing the intrinsic reaction rate.";glutamic_acid;-;-;LCR_without_function
24483;Continuous production of NADP by immobilized Achromobacter aceris cells.;Several microorganisms having higher nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide kinase (NAD kinase, EC 2.7.1.23) activity were immobilized into polyacrylamide gel lattices. The enzyme activity field by immobilization was highest in Achromobacter aceris AKU 0120. By the incubation of the immobilized A. aceris cells at pH 4.0, the NAD kinase activity increased and the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-degradation activity disappeared completely. Enzymatic properties of the immobilized A. aceris cells were investigated and compared with those of intact cells. The optimal pH and the optimal temperature of immobilized cells were the same as those of intact cells. Immobilized cell NAD kinase was more stable than that of intact cells. The operational half-life of immobilized cells was 20 days when the substrate solution was passed through a column packed with immobilized cells at a flow rate which gives a space velocity (SV) of 0.1 hr-1 at 37 degrees C.

The following results were obtained: 1. ED50 values of ITZ and ketoconazole (KCZ) in a murine model of systemic candidiasis produced by intravenous challenge of Candida albicans alls were 32.9 mg/kg and 224 mg/kg, respectively. ITZ suppressed the proliferation of Candida experimentally colonized in the GI-tract of mice and/or a secondary dissemination induced by prednisolone. 2. An oral dose of 40 mg/kg/day ITZ administered for experimental pulmonary cryptococcosis in mice inhibited the fungal proliferation in the lung and the dissemination to the brain. 3. ED50 values of ITZ and KCZ for experimental systemic Aspergillus infection in mice were 103.6 mg/kg and 882 mg/kg, respectively. 4. ITZ suppressed the development of local symptoms in guinea pigs with experimental dermatophytosis. Culture studies performed on cutaneous tissues from infected sites on day-19 postinfection revealed that ITZ treatment lowered the culture-positive rate to a greater extent than KCZ-treatment. 5. Plasma concentrations of ITZ after a single dose of 100 mg/kg in mice were determined using the bioassay method: Cmax was 11 micrograms/ml and T 1/2 was 24 hours. 6.

2026620;Binding of lamin A to polynucleosomes.;Morphological observations suggest a close association between heterochromatin and the nuclear lamina. To investigate the molecular aspects of this association, we have established a simple sedimentation assay employing purified lamin proteins, or their 125I-labeled derivatives, and polynucleosomal particles isolated from avian erythrocytes. We report here that purified, unlabeled lamin A and 125I-lamin A, but not 125I-lamin B or 125I-bovine serum albumin, bind to polynucleosomes in a saturable and specific fashion. The specific binding of 125I-lamin A is of high affinity (Kd = approximately 1 x 10(-9) M) and is distinctly temperature-dependent. This interaction is not affected by exogenous polyionic agents such as polylysine and DNA, but it can be abolished by protease digestion of the polynucleosomes. These data suggest that nuclear lamin A maintains a direct association with a proteinaceous constituent of interphase chromatin.;lysine;-;-;LCR_without_function
711341;Antigens of Streptococcus sanguis: purification and characterization of the b antigen.;The antigen defining Streptococcus sanguis serotype 2 has been designated the b antigen. This antigen can be detected in extracts, obtained from whole cells by autoclaving (Rantz and Randall extraction), as a single precipitin band using a reference antiserum (M-5). However, the extract can also be shown to contain a teichoic acid using anti-polyglycerol phosphate serum. This teichoic acid does not contain the antigenic determinant for group H specificity. Studies of the b antigen have been hampered because of the difficulty in separating the b antigen from the teichoic acid using ion-exchange and molecular sieve chromatography. However, a relatively pure preparation has been obtained by affinity chromatography using anti-polyglycerol phosphate serum coupled to Sepharose. The isolated b antigen is a typical streptococcal cell wall polysaccharide composed of glucose, rhamnose, and N-acetylglucosamine in a molar ratio of 2.5:1.0:0.1.

16168961;Polyhistidine tract expansions in HOXA1 result in intranuclear aggregation and increased cell death.;HOXA1 gene is part of a cluster of homeotic selector genes that regulates the anteroposterior patterning of mammals during embryonic development. HOXA1 encodes two alternatively spliced mRNAs with two isoforms, A and B, the former contains the homeodomain and expressed in early embryonic development. HOXA1 contains a string of 10 histidine repeats. However, individuals heterozygous for 7, 9, 11, and 12 histidine repeat variants were present among the Japanese population, notably in some autism cases. To determine the biological implications of the different polyhistidine repeat lengths, we expressed these variants in COS-7 and a human neuroblastoma cell line (SK-N-SH). Expression of expanded variants of HOXA1 isoform A, containing 11 and 12 polyhistidine, resulted in early and great degree of protein aggregation in the nucleus. This aggregation resulted in accelerated cell death in cells expressing 11 and 12 expanded variants compared to those transfected with 7 and 10 polyhistidine variants. Furthermore, we showed that these aggregates were ubiquitinated and were inhibited by a histidine-modifying compound, DEPC.

1398914;Immunoelectron microscopic studies reveal differences in distribution of sialo-oligosaccharide receptors for Mycoplasma pneumoniae on the epithelium of human and hamster bronchi.;Long-chain sialo-oligosaccharides with poly-N-acetyllactosamine backbones (Ii antigen type) are major host cell receptors for the human pathogen Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Previous immunofluorescence studies of the human bronchial epithelium, using sequence-specific monoclonal antibodies to the branched I-type and linear i-type backbones, have indicated that sialylated and nonsialylated long-chain sequences of both types are richly expressed on the ciliated cells, where they are polarized at the apical aspects. These sequences are lacking in the goblet cells. In the present study, the display of these oligosaccharides has been investigated by electron microscopy (immunogold labelling) in the human bronchial epithelium and in that of the hamster, an animal model commonly used for M. pneumoniae infection. In the human bronchial epithelium, the long-chain branched sequences have been detected along the entire length of the cilia and on microvilli, whereas the linear sequences are confined to the microvilli and the basal aspects of the cilia. On the ciliated epithelial cells of the hamster, by contrast, the branched and linear sequences (sialo- and asialo-) have been detected exclusively on microvilli. A further striking difference is that in the hamster these structures are expressed in abundance on the goblet cells and in the intracellular globules. We suggest that the latter finding may partly explain the relatively large doses of M. pneumoniae required to establish experimental infection in the hamster, as the receptor-bearing secreted mucus may have a protective role in binding to the microorganisms, leading to their clearance by bronchociliary action.;asparagine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

Sera from 394 patients with central nervous system (CNS) infections during 1971-1982 and from 501 persons without CNS manifestations were studied. Jamestown Canyon (JC) and La Crosse (LAC) viruses were found to have been common infectious agents in New York State for at least 16 years. JC virus was the prevalent indicated agent in patients with antibody to California serogroup viruses in screening tests (62 of 93 cases), followed by LAC virus (11 cases), snowshoe hare (2 cases), and trivittatus (1 case). In the remaining 17 patients the subtype was undetermined. LAC virus appears to be more pathogenic for children and to produce more serious illness, as judged by the frequent clinical diagnosis of encephalitis. JC virus affects mainly adults, and meningitis was the most common diagnosis. JC virus appears to cause a stronger neutralizing antibody response than does LAC virus, with a longer persistence of high levels of antibody. Some cases of JC virus infection may have been missed in the past due to the choice of a LAC-like isolate from New York State as the sole antigen in hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) screening tests. Comparison of the HI test and a single-dilution neutralization assay for screening for the two major subtypes, JC and LAC, indicated that the latter procedure is more broadly reactive and is less likely to miss cases if only one test antigen is used.;-;antigen;-;hard_2

As judged from the findings of electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel, UV-spectroscopy and spectrofluometry, the obtained samples of calmodulin contained no significant admixture of other proteins. The Ca-binding capacity of calmodulin of the brain of SHR and NKWR estimated by the method of fluorescent probes were identical. There were also no differences in their capacity to interact with troponine I and to activate the Ca-pump of the erythrocytic membrane and phosphodiesterase of the cardiac muscle. A study on the dependence of activity of phosphodiesterase on the protein content of the brain homogenate from SHR and NKWR revealed no differences in the calmodulin levels in this tissue. On the basis of these data a conclusion was made that impairments of the intracellular distribution of calcium in primary hypertension described earlier are not related to disorders in the metabolism of the universal Ca-binding protein-regulator.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
8055355;Colchicine injected into the anterior forebrain in rats decreases blood pressure without changing the responses to haemorrhage.;In a previous publication rats were shown to develop a marked positive sodium balance 6 days after injection of 1 microgram colchicine into their anterior forebrains. This was thought to be the normal hydromineral balance response to correct an hypothesised colchicine-induced decrease in blood volume (and/or pressure). To test this hypothesis, fluid and sodium intakes and excretion were measured before and then for 6 days following injection of colchicine (1 microgram in 250 nl) into the anterior forebrain, around the diagonal band of Broca, in male Wistar rats. At the end of the 6 days the animals were anaesthetised with urethane and blood pressure measured continuously before during and after a 3.5 ml haemorrhage. Blood pressure was significantly reduced (86.4 +/- 3.9 n = 11 vs. 67.7 +/- 3.4 mm Hg n = 12, p < 0.01) in the colchicine-treated rats compared to the controls and failed to recover following the haemorrhage. Measured blood parameters were similar in both colchicine-treated and nontreated groups, including plasma levels of vasopressin both before and following the haemorrhage. These results suggest that the colchicine injections may have compromised a central component of the sympathetic nervous system, thereby leading to the significant decrease in blood pressure without compensatory vasopressin release, and the lack of recovery of the decrease in blood pressure following a haemorrhage.;-;-;-;hard_0
2766118;Factors affecting the colonization of isolated rabbit intestinal epithelial cells by Vibrio cholerae 01 in vitro.;The adhesive capability of Vibrio cholerae 01 strains to isolated rabbit intestinal epithelial cells was maximally expressed when the bacteria were grown in synthetic broth and was enhanced by the presence of Ca2+ in the growth media. N-Acetyl-D-glucosamine could inhibit the adhesion of the bacteria to rabbit intestinal epithelial cells as could lipopolysaccharide O-antigen from Vibrio cholerae 01 and lectin from Triticum vulgaris. Since the lipopolysaccharide is known to contain N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and because the lectin from Triticum vulgaris shows specificity for this sugar, it is probable that N-acetyl-D-glucosamine is actively involved in the adhesion of Vibrio cholerae 01 to isolated rabbit intestinal epithelial cells.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
8791096;Correlation of membrane lipid peroxidation with oxidation of hemoglobin variants: possibly related to the rates of hemin release.;Experiments were performed to delineate the biochemical mechanism of hemoglobin (Hb)-catalyzed lipid peroxidation in human red blood cells (RBCs). Using a modified Langmuir trough lipid monolayer technique, we found that oxidized Hb induced an increase in lipid monolayer surface pressure, suggesting that oxidized Hb readily releases its heme moiety into the lipid monolayer. To confirm our interpretation that oxidized Hb readily releases its heme moiety, we monitored the fluorescence of Hb tryptophan upon oxidation of Hb. We found an increase in Hb fluorescence in the aqueous phase of our monolayer system after the addition of H2O2. The increase in fluorescence should reflect the departure of heme from globin due to a decrease in fluorescent quenching effect by the heme moiety. The rate of increase in lipid monolayer surface pressure upon Hb oxidation differed from Hb to Hb with an order of Hb E > F > S > A. The ability of various Hbs to affect lipid peroxidation in the RBC membrane, as monitored by the parinaric acid oxidation technique, followed this same order. In addition, hemin was shown to be a more potent catalyst of lipid peroxidation in RBC membrane than nonheme irons.;-;-;-;hard_0
6988441;Involvement of an acrosinlike proteinase in the sulfhydryl-induced degradation of rabbit sperm nuclear protamine.;"Previous studies demonstrated that proteolytic activity is associated with isolated rabbit sperm nuclei and is responsible for the degradation of nuclear protamine that occurs during thiol-induced in vitro decondensation of the nuclei (Zirkin and Chang, 1977; Chang and Zirkin, 1978). In this study, we present the results of experiments designed to characterize this proteolytic activity. Basic protein isolated from rabbit sperm nuclei incubated with 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 1 percent Triton X-100 for increasing periods of time exhibited progressively faster migrating bands on acid-urea polyacrylamide gels, reflection the progressive degradation of protamine. Ultimately, a specific and characteristic peptide banding pattern resulted. When sperm nuclei were treated with the esterase inhibitor nitrophenyl-p-guanidino benzoate (NPGB) to inhibit the nuclear-associated proteolytic activity and then incubated with one of several exogenous proteinases in addition to DTT and Triton X-100, characteristic peptide banding patterns were seen for each exogenous proteinase employed. For trypsin, chymotrypsin, pronase, and papain, the peptide banding patterns differed from one another and from the pattern characteristic of protamine degradation by the nuclear-associated proteinase. By contrast, when rabbit acrosin served as the exogenous proteinase, the peptide banding pattern seen was identical to the pattern characteristic of the nuclear-associated proteinase. These results demonstrate directly that the proteinase associated with rabbit sperm nuclei and involved in sperm nuclear decondensation in vitro is acrosinlike.";-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
11571578;Transfection of large plasmids in primary human myoblasts.;The ex vivo gene therapy approach for Duchenne muscular dystrophy is promising since myoblast transplantation in primates is now very efficient. One obstacle to this treatment is the low transfection efficiency of large DNA constructs in human primary myoblasts. Small plasmids can be easily transfected with the new phosphonolipid described in this study. However, a dramatic drop in transfection efficiency is observed with plasmids of 12 kb or more containing EGFP minidystrophin and EGFP dystrophin fusion genes. The transfection of human primary myoblasts with such large plasmids could only be achieved when the DNA was linked to an adenovirus with the use of polyethylenimine (PEI), with efficiencies ranging between 3 and 5% of transitory transfection. Branched 2 kDa PEI was less toxic in PEI adenofection than branched 25 kDa PEI or linear 22 kDa PEI. The adenovirus was an absolute necessity for an efficient transfection. An integrin-binding peptide, a nuclear localization signal peptide, chloroquine, glycerol or cell cycle synchronization using aphidicolin did not enhance PEI adenofection. Following PEI adenofection, the adenoviral proteins were detected using a polyclonal antibody. The detected antigens fell below the detectable level after 12 days in culture. We thus provide in this study an efficient and reproducible method to permit efficient delivery of large plasmids to human primary myoblasts for the ex vivo gene therapy of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
35482253;Calpains as novel players in the molecular pathogenesis of spinocerebellar ataxia type 17.;Spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a polyglutamine-encoding trinucleotide repeat expansion in the gene of transcription factor TATA box-binding protein (TBP). While its underlying pathomechanism is elusive, polyglutamine-expanded TBP fragments of unknown origin mediate the mutant protein's toxicity. Calcium-dependent calpain proteases are protagonists in neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we demonstrate that calpains cleave TBP, and emerging C-terminal fragments mislocalize to the cytoplasm. SCA17 cell and rat models exhibited calpain overactivation, leading to excessive fragmentation and depletion of neuronal proteins in vivo. Transcriptome analysis of SCA17 cells revealed synaptogenesis and calcium signaling perturbations, indicating the potential cause of elevated calpain activity. Pharmacological or genetic calpain inhibition reduced TBP cleavage and aggregation, consequently improving cell viability. Our work underlines the general significance of calpains and their activating pathways in neurodegenerative disorders and presents these proteases as novel players in the molecular pathogenesis of SCA17.;glutamine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
9029104;The 14.1 surrogate light chain promoter has lineage- and stage-restricted activity.;The 14.1 surrogate light chain protein is expressed on human pre-B lymphocytes in association with Vpre-B and the mu Ig heavy chain to form the pre-B receptor. The 14.1 chain has also been called the lambda (lambda)-like (LL) protein and is homologous to murine lambda5. The 14.1(IGLL1) gene is expressed in a lineage- and stage-restricted manner. To understand the molecular mechanism of the 14.1 gene tissue- and stage-specific expression, we analyzed the 5'-flanking region and characterized the promoter for this gene. In this report, we identify two DNase I-hypersensitive sites located at 2.6 kilobases (HSS 1) and 0.2 kilobases (HSS 1) upstream of 14.1 exon 1. These hypersensitive sites are present in pre-B lymphocyte cell lines, but absent in mature B and T cell lines. We have used RNase protection analysis to localize the 5' major transcriptional start site and rapid amplification of 5' cDNA ends to identify multiple start sites within the TATA-less, GC-rich 14.1 promoter. The region encompassing HSS 2 was analyzed for promoter activity. Transfection of cell lines with a series of truncated segments of the 5' flanking region linked to the luciferase reporter gene revealed that the 14.1 promoter is lineage- and stage-specific, and we localized this activity to positions +150 to +227 relative to the 5' major transcriptional start site.;cysteine;-;-;LCR_without_function
7066911;Biosynthesis of an interstitial type of collagen by cloned human gastric carcinoma cells.;In an attempt to elucidate the role played by neoplastic epithelial cells in the formation of stromal collagen, the synthesis of collagen by two cloned human gastric carcinoma cell lines was studied. The presence of antigenicity of procollagen alpha 1(I) chain in the cytoplasms of both carcinoma cell lines growing in culture was demonstrated by an immunocytochemical technique using specific antibodies. After denaturation of the radiolabeled collagenous proteins extracted from the combined cells and culture media, two components comigrating with authentic alpha 1(I) and alpha 2 chains on sodium dodecyl sulfate:polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were found. Electrophoretogram analysis revealed further a dense band slightly slower than the alpha 1(I) chain, most likely representing alpha 1(I) trimer. These radioactive components disappeared after exposure of the samples to bacterial collagenase. The relative activity of collagen synthesis determined by using purified collagenase was slightly higher than that of fibroblasts derived from human synovial membrane in culture. The same antibodies to procollagen alpha 1(I) chain also labeled the cytoplasms of carcinoma cells, and extracellular matrix of the tumors developed after transplantation of one of the cell lines into the nude mice. Our data indicate that both human gastric carcinoma cell lines synthesize type 1 collagen in vivo as well as in vitro and suggest that carcinoma cells may play an active role in the formation of stromal collagen in most human carcinomas.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
1756259;Phase II evaluation of interferon added to tamoxifen in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.;This phase II trial evaluated the clinical role of interferon (IFN) in overcoming tamoxifen (TAM) resistance in breast cancer. Twenty women and 1 man received recombinant alpha interferon (5 million units per meter squared intramuscularly, 5 times per week) plus TAM (10 mg orally, twice daily) for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, either after failing tamoxifen therapy or as frontline hormonal therapy. Of the 9 evaluable patients with disease progression after an objective response to TAM, there were no partial or complete responses with the addition of IFN. Ten evaluable patients received TAM plus IFN as frontline hormonal therapy with 2 complete and 3 partial responses for an overall response rate (RR) of 50% (95% confidence interval = 19-81), a 71% RR for ER-positive patients (95% confidence interval = 29-96) and no responses in ER-unknown patients. Sixteen patients required dose reductions of IFN and 8 patients discontinued therapy due to toxicity. It is unlikely that the RR for TAM plus IFN is greater that than seen with TAM alone, or that the addition of IFN to TAM therapy can overcome clinical TAM resistance.;-;-;-;hard_0

Twenty-one healthy, normolipidemic, young males consumed an NCEP-I diet (30% of energy as fat) during a 25-d period. Subjects were then assigned to two 4-wk study periods, according to a randomized, crossover design. Group one was placed on an olive oil-enriched diet (40% fat, 22% MUFAs), followed by a 4-wk period of a sunflower oil-enriched diet (40% fat, 22% MUFAs). In group two, the order of the diets was reversed. Both MUFA dietary periods resulted in an increase in high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (7% for the olive oil diet and 4% for the sunflower oil diet) and in apolipoprotein (apo) A-I (9% for both) compared with the NCEP-I diet. Low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and apo B concentrations (x +/- SEM) were lower (P < 0.05) during the sunflower oil diet (2.40 +/- 0.11 mmol/L, 0.85 +/- 0.04 mg/L) than during the olive oil diet (2.64 +/- 0.15 mmol/L, 0.93 +/- 0.05 mg/L).

9261575;Bilateral activation of fronto-parietal networks by incrementing demand in a working memory task.;Working memory (WM) is known to activate the prefrontal cortex. In the present study we hypothesized that when additional contingencies are added to the instruction of a WM task, this would increase the WM load and result in the activation of additional prefrontal areas. With positron emission tomography we measured regional cerebral blood flow in nine subjects performing a control task and two delayed matching to sample tasks, in which the subjects were matching colours and patterns to a reference picture. The second of the two delayed matching tasks had a more complex instruction than the first, with additional contingencies of how to alternate between the matching of colours and patterns. This task thus required the subjects not only to remember a stimulus to match but also to perform this matching according to a specified plan. Both delayed matching tasks activated cortical fields in the middle frontal gyrus, the frontal operculum, upper cingulate gyrus, inferior parietal cortex and cortex lining the intraparietal sulcus, all in the left hemisphere. When alternated delayed matching was compared to simple delayed matching, increases were located in the right superior and middle frontal gyrus and the right anterior inferior parietal cortex. The increased demand during alternated matching thus resulted in bilateral activation of both dorsolateral prefrontal and inferior parietal cortex. The area in the inferior parietal cortex has previously been coactivated with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in several WM tasks, irrespective of the sensory modality of the stimuli, and during tasks involving planning.;-;-;-;hard_0

21084459;Human leukocyte antigens A*3001 and A*3002 show distinct peptide-binding patterns of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein TB10.4: consequences for immune recognition.;High-tuberculosis (TB)-burden countries are located in sub-Saharan Africa. We examined the frequency of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, followed by recombinant expression of the most frequent HLA-A alleles, i.e., HLA-A*3001 and HLA-A*3002, to study differences in mycobacterial peptide presentation and CD8(+) T-cell recognition. We screened a peptide library (9-mer peptides with an 8-amino-acid overlap) for binding, affinity, and off-rate of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis-associated antigen TB10.4 and identified only three TB10.4 peptides with considerable binding to HLA-A*3001. In contrast, 22 peptides bound to HLA-A*3002. This reflects a marked difference in the binding preference between the two alleles, with A*3002 tolerating a more promiscuous peptide-binding pattern and A*3001 accommodating only a very selective peptide repertoire. Subsequent analysis of the affinity and off-rate of the binding peptides revealed a strong affinity (8 nM to 7 μM) and moderate off-rate (20 min to 3 h) for both alleles. Construction of HLA-A*3001 and HLA-A*3002 tetramers containing selected binding peptides from TB10.4, including a peptide which was shared among both alleles, QIMYNYPAM (TB10.4(3-11)), allowed us to enumerate epitope-specific T cells in HLA-A*3001- and HLA-A*3002-typed patients with active TB. HLA-A*3001 and HLA-A*3002 major histocompatibility complex-peptide complexes were recognized in individuals with active TB, irrespective of their homozygous HLA-A*3001 or HLA-A*3002 genetic background.

29875761;SbbR/SbbA, an Important ArpA/AfsA-Like System, Regulates Milbemycin Production in Streptomyces bingchenggensis.;Milbemycins, a group of 16-membered macrolide antibiotics, are used widely as insecticides and anthelmintics. Previously, a limited understanding of the transcriptional regulation of milbemycin biosynthesis has hampered efforts to enhance antibiotic production by engineering of regulatory genes. Here, a novel ArpA/AfsA-type system, SbbR/SbbA (SBI_08928/SBI_08929), has been identified to be involved in regulating milbemycin biosynthesis in the industrial strain S. bingchenggensis BC04. Inactivation of sbbR in BC04 resulted in markedly decreased production of milbemycin, while deletion of sbbA enhanced milbemycin production. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and DNase I footprinting studies showed that SbbR has a specific DNA-binding activity for the promoters of milR (the cluster-situated activator gene for milbemycin production) and the bidirectionally organized genes sbbR and sbbA. Transcriptional analysis suggested that SbbR directly activates the transcription of milR, while represses its own transcription and that of sbbA. Moreover, 11 novel targets of SbbR were additionally found, including seven regulatory genes located in secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (e.g., sbi_08420, sbi_08432, sbi_09158, sbi_00827, sbi_01376, sbi_09325, and sig24 ) and four well-known global regulatory genes (e.g., glnR , wblA , atrA , and mtrA/B ). These data suggest that SbbR is not only a direct activator of milbemycin production, but also a pleiotropic regulator that controls the expression of other cluster-situated regulatory genes and global regulatory genes. Overall, this study reveals the upper-layer regulatory system that controls milbemycin biosynthesis, which will not only expand our understanding of the complex regulation in milbemycin biosynthesis, but also provide a basis for an approach to improve milbemycin production via genetic manipulation of SbbR/SbbA system.;-;nucleic acid binding;-;hard_2

All the C. sporogenes and C. novyi strains reacted with their homologous antiserum; these two species showed no cross-reactions. All the reactions were investigated further by running the EDTA extracts on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The separated molecules were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, reacted with antiserum and complexes visualized with horseradish peroxidase conjugate reagents. Only those extracts that reacted significantly in the ELISA gave a pattern of cross-reactive antigen bands and the number of bands and intensity of stain closely paralleled the strength of the ELISA reaction.";-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3

Microimmunofluorescence was performed in Terasaki plates on which target cells were attached by poly-L-lysine and glutaraldehyde or by short time culture of the cells in Terasaki plates. The direct plate freezing method prevented initial hybridoma cells from changes or disappearance of antibody productions during screening of hybridoma supernatants; the microimmunofluorescence staining method permits fast and detailed estimation of specificity of antibodies of hybridomas by saving time and minimal consumption of supernatant for checking.

27783;Hydrolysis of poly (A) to adenine nucleotides by purified poly (A) polymerase.;Highly purified poly(A) polymerase (polynucleotide adenylyltransferase, EC 2.7.7.19), which synthesizes poly(A) from ATP substrate, can also catalyze hydrolysis of poly(A). The enzyme, designated as poly(A) hydrolase, requires either Mn2+ or Mg2+ for activity. Although AMP is the predominant product of the reaction, ADP and ATP are also formed. The enzyme is a 3'-exonuclease that does not degrade poly(A) associated with poly(A) poly(U) helical structure. AMP, ADP, and ATP inhibit the hydrolytic reaction. These data suggest that (i) the levels of adenine nucleotides regulate synthesis and degradation of poly(A), (ii) poly(A) itself is a storage form of adenine nucleotides, (iii) the hydrolytic reaction is responsible for poly(A) shortening or turnover observed in vivo, and (iv) the synthetic and hydrolytic activities are functions of the same protein molecule.;alanine;-;-;LCR_without_function
17272389;Suppression of thyrotropin receptor constitutive activity by a monoclonal antibody with inverse agonist activity.;TSH binding to the TSH receptor (TSHR) induces thyrocyte growth and proliferation primarily by activating the adenylyl cyclase signaling pathway. Relative to the other glycoprotein hormone receptors, the TSHR has considerable ligand-independent (constitutive) activity. We describe a TSHR monoclonal antibody (CS-17) with the previously unrecognized property of being an inverse agonist for TSHR constitutive activity. This property is retained, even when constitutive activity is extremely high consequent to diverse TSHR extracellular region mutations. A similar effect on an activating mutation at the base of the sixth transmembrane helix (not accessible to direct CS-17 contact) indicates that CS-17 is acting allosterically. Administered to mice in vivo, CS-17 reduces serum T(4) levels. The CS-17 epitope is conformational and a significant portion lies in the C-terminal region of the TSHR leucine-rich domain (residues 260-289). By interacting with the large TSHR extracellular domain, CS-17 is, to our knowledge, the first antibody reported to be an inverse agonist for a member of the G protein receptor superfamily. After humanization of its murine constant region, CS-17 has the potential to be an adjunctive therapeutic agent in athyreotic patients with residual well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma as well as pending definitive treatment in some selected hyperthyroidism states. ;leucine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
7958021;The immunological features and pathophysiology of ocular cicatricial pemphigoid.;Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid is an uncommon but severe and potentially blinding systemic disease.

All of these diseases have circulating antibodies that bind to the basement membrane of mucous membranes. The individual diseases differ by each having a specific component of the basement membrane complex as its antigen. In acute ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, the conjunctiva is infiltrated with neutrophils, macrophages, Langerhans cells and CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells while in the chronic disease the conjunctiva is infiltrated mainly by CD8+ T-cells. There is evidence of activation of these T-cells as CD4+ cells as shown by expression of the interleukin-2 receptor and increased expression of major histocompatibility class II antigens within the tissue.

2038305;Analysis of conserved domains identifies a unique structural feature of a chloroplast heat shock protein.;"A low molecular weight heat shock protein which localizes to chloroplasts has been identified in several plant species. This protein belongs to a eukaryotic superfamily of small HSPs, all of which contain a conserved carboxyl-terminal domain. To investigate further the structure of this HSP, we isolated and sequenced cDNA clones for the chloroplast LMW HSPs from Petunia hybrida and Arabidopsis thaliana. The cloning of chloroplast HSPs from these two species enabled us to compare the amino acid sequences of this protein from plant species (petunia, Arabidopsis, pea, soybean and maize) that represent evolutionarily divergent taxonomic subclasses. Three conserved regions were identified, which are designated as regions I, II and III. Regions I and II are also shared by cytoplasmic LMW HSPs and therefore are likely to have functional roles common to all eukaryotic LMW HSPs. In contrast, consensus region III is not found in other LMW HSPs. Secondary structure analysis predicts that this region forms an amphipathic alpha-helix with high conservation of methionine residues on the hydrophobic face and 100% conservation of residues on the hydrophilic face. This structure is similar to three helices, termed ""methionine bristles"", which are found in a methionine-rich domain of a 54 kDa protein component of signal recognition particle (SRP54). The conservation of regions I and II among LMW cytoplasmic and chloroplast HSPs suggests that these HSPs perform related functions in different cellular compartments. However, identification of the methionine bristle domain suggests that chloroplast HSPs also have unique functions or substrates within the special environment of the chloroplast or other plastids.

6410180;Soluble pig intestinal cell membrane components with affinities for E. coli K88+ antigen.;"Pig intestinal brush borders (BB) were radiolabeled by iodination using the lactoperoxidase-hydrogen peroxide procedure. The BB were then detergent solubilized, centrifuged to remove particulate material, and chromatographed on Sepharose CL-4B. The fractions were incubated with K88+ E. coli using an in vitro binding assay. Binding of the iodinated membranes to K88+ E. coli occurred throughout a wide range of molecular weight components, in excess of 690K daltons to near 25K daltons. The system utilizing intact K88+ E. coli and solubilized BB was shown to be saturable. Prior contact of K88+ E. coli with nonradiolabeled membranes or specific antibodies to K88+ pili inhibited binding of the radiolabeled BB. Simple sugars were tested for their ability to block binding of the labeled BB; partial inhibition occurred with galactose (17.9%), galactosamine (32%), glucose (10.6%), and N-acetylglucosamine (32%). Calcium enhanced binding with as little as 10 microM. A 10 x increase in binding occurred with 500 microM calcium. Affinity chromatography using K88+ pili coupled on agarose beads avidly bound the labeled BB. The receptor membranes were eluted with high molar concentrations of salt, however considerable degradation occurred. Despite low yields from the affinity system, receptor membranes with higher binding activities were recovered. Protein: glycoprotein ratios were 1:4. Elution with SDS and electrophoresis on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels in the presence of a reducing agent produced two major subunits 35--32K and 23K daltons. These components were recovered from the gels and retained their binding activity. This information suggests that the intestinal receptor responsible for binding of K88+ E. coli is a glycoprotein, that in the native state exists in multimeric forms.";-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3

1086476;Cells that express viral antigens but lack H-2 determinants are not lysed by immune thymus-derived lymphocytes but are lysed by other antiviral immune attack mechanisms.;Murine F9 teratoma cells do not express major transplantation antigens detectable by either serologic or alloreactive assays of thymus-dependent lymphocytes (T cells). Such cells can be infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus or vaccinia virus, do express viral antigens on the cell surface, and can release infectious virus in amounts equivalent to those of other H-2 bearing murine cell lines. Immunologic injury of virus-infected F9 cells occurs after the addition of specific antiviral antibody and complement or of specific antiviral antibody and unsensitized lymphoid cells (antibody-mediated cell-dependent killing). In contrast, injury does not follow the addition of immune cytotoxic T cells. These results indicate that possession of H-2 antigens is not a requirement for a cell's infection by or production of virus. Further, expression of viral antigens on the cell's surface, although adequate for antibody-mediated immune injury, is by itself insufficient for direct T cell-mediated lysis. The major transplantation antigens thus probably represent the cell surface structures that are crucial for T-mediated cell wall damage that results in chromium release.;-;antigen;-;hard_2

34335623;T Cell Response in Ischemic Stroke: From Mechanisms to Translational Insights.;Ischemic stroke, caused by a sudden disruption of blood flow to the brain, is a leading cause of death and exerts a heavy burden on both patients and public health systems. Currently available treatments for ischemic stroke are very limited and are not feasible in many patients due to strict time windows required for their administration. Thus, novel treatment strategies are keenly required. T cells, which are part of the adaptive immune system, have gained more attention for its effects in ischemic stroke. Both preclinical and clinical studies have revealed the conflicting roles for T cells in post-stroke inflammation and as potential therapeutic targets. This review summarizes the mediators of T cell recruitment, as well as the temporal course of its infiltration through the blood-brain-barrier, choroid plexus, and meningeal pathways. Furthermore, we describe the mechanisms behind the deleterious and beneficial effects of T cells in the brain, in both antigen-dependent and antigen-independent manners, and finally we specifically focus on clinical and preclinical studies that have investigated T cells as potential therapeutic targets for ischemic stroke.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
8954838;Polymerase Chain Reaction for RNA Analysis;This paper presents two methods using the polymerase chain reaction to allow the efficient comparison of the relative amounts of particular mRNA species present in tissue or cell cultures. The methods have been used on cultures of primary dorsal root ganglion neurons that produce small yields of RNA. The mRNAs examined encode the transcription factors NGFIA and Oct-2, neither of which are present in great abundance in cellular material. Nevertheless, the polymerase chain reaction was able to amplify rare mRNAs to sufficient levels at which differences could be detected between untreated cultured neurons and cultures treated with nerve growth factor.;-;transcription factor;-;hard_2
8104401;Transcranial Doppler in neurosurgery.;This chapter describes the use of the transcranial Doppler apparatus in neurosurgery. The principles of Doppler insonation, the techniques of recording and the use of activation techniques is described. The relationship between blood flow and blood velocity is discussed, and the interaction of various pharmacological agents. The establishment of normal values for the laboratory and various vessels insonated is emphasised. The use of indices particularly the pulsatility index is described together with its variations. Cerebral vascular reactivity measurements and the interaction of Doppler recordings with raised intracranial pressure, useful in assessment of cerebral perfusion pressure as in head injury and in terminal cases, is documented. The use of transcranial Doppler in management of head injury and subarachnoid haemorrhage is described. The latter is probably the most useful routine place for Doppler measurement in neurosurgical practice and the documentation of the onset and progress of vasospasm is the final portion of the chapter.;-;-;-;hard_0
379607;[Influence of protein bound with single-stranded DNA on the synthesis of RNA and poly(A). III. Protein product of F1 gene 5].;"Influence of the protein product of F1 phage gene 5 (protein 5) on the synthesis RNA and poly(A) in vitro was studied. It has been shown, that protein 5 has no effect on the transcription of the native DNA by E. coli RNA-polymerase, but completely prevents RNA and poly(A) synthesis on the denatured or single-stranded DNA at the protein/DNA ratio 10:1. Protein 5 inhibits poly(A) synthesis with oligo(dT)9 and oligo(dT)12 as a template, preventing binding of enzyme to the oligonucleotide. After the initiation of the poly(A) synthesis the inhibition becomes considerably wearer. The biological function of the inhibition of the transcription by ""unwinding"" proteins is discussed.";alanine;-;-;LCR_without_function
1391955;Generation of vasoactive peptide bradykinin from human umbilical vein endothelium-bound high molecular weight kininogen by plasma kallikrein.;High molecular weight kininogen (HK) is a multifunctional plasma glycoprotein that occupies a critical position in pathways that link inflammation and coagulation. It is an inhibitor of sulfhydryl proteases and has procoagulant properties. It is also a source of the vasoactive peptide bradykinin (BK). It has been previously shown that HK binds to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in culture. We have further characterized that interaction herein. Immunohistochemical experiments have indicated that when freshly obtained umbilical vein segments were treated with HK, washed, and probed with anti-HK antibodies, HK was localized on the endothelium. We next determined whether HUVEC-bound HK can be cleaved by plasma kallikrein to release BK. Cultured HUVEC were incubated with unlabeled HK for varying times, washed, and the kinetics of BK release by plasma kallikrein were assayed by radioimmunoassay. Results indicated that kallikrein released BK from HUVEC in proportion to the initial amount of bound HK. No release of BK occurred in the absence of kallikrein. Also, there was no BK release upon kallikrein treatment of the HUVEC not treated with exogenous HK. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography of HUVEC-bound 125I-HK indicated that addition of kallikrein resulted in cleavage of HK, thus corroborating the BK release experiments. Comparison of cleavage patterns has also indicated that cell-bound HK is slightly less susceptible to digestion by kallikrein than free HK. Therefore, our data suggest that human HK can bind to vascular endothelium in situ and that plasma kallikrein can recognize endothelial-bound HK as a substrate and liberate the vasoactive peptide BK.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
27641056;Protein profile of seminal plasma and functionality of spermatozoa during the reproductive season in the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).;"The purpose of the study was to analyze seminal plasma composition, sperm production, and sperm motility over the course of the spawning season in the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The highest mean percent of motile sperm (carp, 98.3 ± 1.6%; rainbow trout, 92.8 ± 5.6%) and highest spermatozoon velocity (carp, 286.3 ± 7.8 μm sec-1 ; rainbow trout, 245.3 ± 8.3 μm sec-1 ) were observed in the middle phase of the spawning period, at 5 sec post-activation. Sperm volume and concentration increased in the early spawning period, then decreased significantly toward the end of the season in both species. Seminal plasma osmolality was 262-270 mOsmol kg-1 from carp and 232-248 mOsmol kg-1 from rainbow trout, with little variation over the spawning period. Protein concentration in carp seminal plasma was stable throughout the reproductive season, whereas the highest protein level (2.1 ± 0.3 mg mL-1 ) in rainbow trout was observed in the middle phase of the spawning period. Seminal plasma composition in both species was analyzed using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis combined with mass spectrometry. Thirteen differentially expressed protein spots in carp seminal plasma and sixteen spots in rainbow trout seminal plasma varied over the course of the reproductive season. The unique proteins identified are involved in the regulation of spermatogenesis, sperm motility, maintenance of sperm membrane lipid stability, and antioxidant protection. These results provide a deeper understanding of the role of fish seminal plasma proteins as well as a list of novel markers of sperm quality. Mol. Reprod.

6299952;Virus-specific immunity in neonatal and adult mouse rotavirus infection.;Mouse rotavirus (epizootic diarrhea of infant mice) was used as a model to study the role of virus-specific immunity in infection and diarrheal disease. The distribution of viral antigen in intestinal tissues was determined by immunofluorescent staining with anti-simian rotavirus (SA-11) serum. The location and proportion of antigen-positive cells appeared to vary as a function of time postinfection and age of the animal at the time of infection. In animals infected at 1 and 7 days of age, antigen-positive cells (5 to 25%) were first detected (1 day postinfection) in the proximal segment of the small intestine, and infection progressed to the middle and distal segments. At 10 days postinfection, virus-infected cells were no longer observed in the proximal segment. In animals infected at 21 days of age (disease-free), a significantly lower proportion of cells were antigen positive (2 to 5%), and they were restricted to the middle and distal segments of the small intestine. Infection, defined according to the presence of virus and viral antigens in intestinal tissues and by seroconversion in the immunoglobulin M (IgM) isotype as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with SA-11 antigen, was observed for all age groups (neonatal to adult), even in the presence of virus-specific serum or intestinal immunoglobulins. On the other hand, diarrheal disease was not detected in neonatal mice (1 to 3 days old) positive for passively acquired virus-specific intestinal IgG. The presence of virus-specific IgA in the intestinal tract at the time of infection did not protect from subsequent diarrheal disease. Virus-specific, cell-mediated immunity, determined by a delayed-type hypersensitivity response, did not develop in neonatal mice infected at 5 and 12 days of age. Reinfection of adult mice was associated with suppression of virus-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity and a significant decrease in the titers of the virus-specific serum IgG and IgA.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
941804;The interaction of leukocytes and their hydrolases with bacteria in vitro and in vivo: the modification of the bactericidal and bacteriolytic reactions by cationic and anionic macromolecular substances and by anti-inflammatory agents.;Acid hydrolases from extracts of human blood leucocytes lyse Staph.aureus, Staph.albus and Strep.faecalis in vitro. The leucocyte enzymes can be substituted by a lytic mixture which contains crude trypsin, lysolecithin, phospholipase C and lysozyme, which lyse other bacterial species, e.g. E.coli and Listeria which are resistant  to leucocyte enzymes. Bacteriolysis by the lytic agents is strongly inhibited by the anionic polyelectrolytes, heparin, chondroitin sulphate, DNA, dextran sulphate and other sulphated mucopolysaccharides, by the cationic materials, histone, protamine sulphate, leucocyte cationic proteins and polylysine. Other strong inhibitors are trypsan blue and congo red, the phospholipids phosphatidyl serine and ethanolamine, gold thiomalate, extracts of coffee and tea and the anti-inflammatory agents, ultracorten-H, and ultracortenol. Bacteriolysis is also strongly inhibited by normal human serum and by synovial fluids from patients with a variety of joint diseases. The inhibitors in these body fluids are associated with the globulin fractions. Since mixtures of anionic and cationic polyelectrolytes, at equimolar concentrations, failed to inhibit bacteriolysis by leucocyte enzymes, it is postulated that a delicate balance between positively and negatively charged inhibitors control the degradation of cell wall components of bacteria in inflamed areas. Such bacterial components, induce 'storage type' granulomas. The possible role played by polyelectrolytes in the control of the inflammatory process induced by leucocyte hydrolases will be discussed.;lysine;-;-;LCR_without_function
7373040;Detection and characterization of membrane antigens of Toxoplasma gondii.;Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites were surface radioiodinated by the lactoperoxidase technique, and the solubilized membrane proteins were analyzed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Four major labeled proteins with apparent m.w. of 43,000, 35,000, 27,000, and 14,000 were detected. None of the radioiodinated proteins bound to concanavalin A-Sepharose. When a panel of eight different fluorescein-conjugated lectins was used in an attempt to characterize further the nature of the cell membrane, none of the lectins bound to intact tachyzoites. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis did not reveal any significant differences among three different strains of Toxoplasma. Each of the radioiodinated surface proteins was precipitable by sera from mice chronically infected with the same strain as well as by a series of sera from mice infected with other strains. Sera from humans with acute Toxoplasma infection showed more variability in that some precipitated all labeled proteins whereas others precipitated only two or three of them. Monoclonal antibodies (2G11 and 3E6) prepared by hybridization of spleen cells from Toxoplasma-immune mice with myeloma cells consistently precipitated both the solubilized 35,000 and 14,000 dalton proteins, whereas 1E3 precipitated the 43,000-dalton protein and 1E11 the 27,000-dalton protein.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
8550844;Human diabetes associated with defects in nuclear regulatory proteins for the insulin receptor gene.;The control of gene transcription is mediated by sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins (trans-acting factors) that bind to upstream regulatory elements (cis elements). We have previously identified two DNA-binding proteins that specifically interact with two unique AT-rich sequences of the 5' regulatory region of the insulin receptor gene which have in vivo promoter activity. Herein we have investigated the expression of these DNA-binding proteins in cells from two unrelated patients with insulin resistance and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. In these patients, the insulin receptor gene was normal. In EBV-transformed lymphoblasts from both patients, insulin receptor mRNA levels and insulin receptor expression were decreased. The expression of nuclear-binding proteins for the 5' regulatory region of the insulin receptor gene was markedly reduced, and this defect paralleled the decrease in insulin receptor protein expression. These studies indicate that DNA-binding proteins to the regulatory region of the insulin receptor gene are important for expression of the insulin receptor. Further, they suggest that in affected individuals, defects in the expression of these proteins may cause decreased insulin receptor expression and insulin resistance.;threonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
2430986;Calcimedins: purification and characterization from chicken gizzard and rat and bovine livers.;A procedure for the simultaneous extraction and purification of four calcimedins from chicken gizzard, rat liver, and bovine liver is described. These proteins bind to hydrophobic resins in a calcium-dependent manner similar to calmodulin and troponin C. The four calcimedins purified had molecular weights 67,000 (67K), 35,000 (35K), 33,000 (33K), and 30,000 (30K) as determined by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Their ability to bind calcium was demonstrated using the Hummel-Dreyer method. Their tissue concentration ranged between 1-4 mg/100 g wet weight in the three tissues studied. During gel filtration, calcimedins 67K and 35K, had Rf (Ve-Vo/Vt-Vo) values of 0.46 and 0.74, respectively, indicating monomeric structure. However, the 33K and 30K calcimedins had Rf values of 0.26 (molecular weights greater than 90,000) suggesting that they occur as subunit complexes in their native state. Antibodies raised against the 67K and 35K calcimedins showed cross reactivity suggesting possible common origin. However, peptide mapping studies showed that they are independent proteins with considerable peptide homology. Antibodies to 30/33K calcimedins did not cross-react with either 67K or 35K calcimedins. Moreover, their peptide maps were strikingly different from those of 67K and 35K calcimedins indicating that they are unique. At present, the regulatory function of this group of proteins is not clear. Indirect evidences support the possibility that they are involved in membrane associated events, such as endocytosis and secretion.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
9580677;A novel splice variant of the transcription factor Nrf1 interacts with the TNFalpha promoter and stimulates transcription.;Common signaling chains of various receptor families, despite some similarities, are able to provoke quite different cellular responses. This suggests that they are linked to different cascades and transcription factors, dependent on the context of the ligand binding moiety and the cell type. The ITAM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif) containing gamma chain of the FcepsilonRI, FcgammaRI, FcgammaRIII and the T-cell receptor is one of these shared signaling molecules. Here, we show that in the context of the FcgammaRIII, the gamma chain activates the transcription factor Nrf1 or a closely related protein that specifically interacts with the extended kappa3 site in the TNFalpha promoter. A novel splice variant of Nrf1 with a 411 bp deletion of the serine-rich region, resulting in an overall structure reminiscent of the BTB and CNC homology (Bach) proteins, was isolated from the corresponding DC18 cells. In a gel shift analysis, this bacterially expressed splice variant binds to the TNFalpha promoter site after in vitro phosphorylation by casein kinase II (CKII). In addition, cotransfection studies demonstrate that this splice variant mediates induced transcription at the TNFalpha promoter after stimulation/activation in a heterologous system.;serine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
23827311;Expression, purification, and evaluation of recombinant LecA as a candidate for an amebic colitis vaccine.;"Entamoeba histolytica, which causes amebic colitis and liver abscess, is considered a major enteric pathogen in residents and travelers to developing countries where the disease is endemic. Interaction of this protozoan parasite with the intestine is mediated through the binding of the trophozoite stage to intestinal mucin and epithelium via a galactose and N-acetyl-d-galactosamine (Gal/GalNAc) lectin comprised of a disulfide linked heavy (ca. 180 kDa) and light chain (ca. 35 kDa) and a noncovalently bound intermediate subunit (ca. 150 kDa). Our efforts to develop a vaccine against this pathogen have focused on an internal 578 amino acid fragment, designated LecA, located within the cysteine-rich region of the heavy chain subunit because: (i) it is a major target of adherence-blocking antibodies of seropositive individuals and (ii) vaccination with his-tagged LecA provides protection in animal models. We developed a purification process for preparing highly purified non-tagged LecA using a codon-optimized gene expressed in Escherichia coli. The process consisted of: (i) cell lysis, collection and washing of inclusion bodies; (ii) solubilization and refolding of denatured LecA; and (iii) a polishing gel filtration step. The purified fragment existed primarily as a random coil with β-sheet structure, contained low endotoxin and nucleic acid, was highly immunoreactive, and elicited antibodies that recognized native lectin and that inhibited in vitro adherence of trophozoites to CHO cells. Immunization of CBA mice with LecA resulted in significant protection against cecal colitis. Our procedure yields sufficient amounts of highly purified LecA for future studies on stability, immunogenicity, and protection with protein-adjuvant formulations.";cysteine;-;-;LCR_without_function

7316962;The binding of complement component C3 to antibody-antigen aggregates after activation of the alternative pathway in human serum.;Preformed immune aggregates, containing antigen and either IgG (immunoglobulin G) or F(ab')2 rabbit antibody, were incubated with normal human serum under conditions allowing activation of only the alternative pathway of complement. Both the IgG and F(ab')2 immune aggregates bound C3b, the activated form of the complement component C3, in a similar manner, 2-3% of the C3 available in the serum being bound to the aggregates as C3b, and the rest remaining in the fluid phase as inactive C3b or uncleaved C3. It was found that the C3b was probably covalently bound to the IgG in the aggregates, since C3b-IgG complexes could be demonstrated on sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, after repeated washing with buffers containing high salt or boiling under denaturing conditions. Incubation of the C3b-antibody-antigen aggregates in buffers known to destroy ester linkages had little effect on the C3b-IgG complexes, which suggested that C3b and IgG might be linked by an amide bond. Two main types of C3b-IgG complexes were found that had apparent mol.wts. of 360000 and 580000, corresponding to either one to two C3b molecules respectively bound to one molecule of antibody. On reduction of the C3b-IgG complexes it was found that the beta-chain, but not the alpha'-chain, of C3b was released along with all the light chain of IgG but only about half or less of the heavy chain of IgG. These results indicate that, during activation of the alternative pathway of complement by immune aggregates containing IgG antibody, the alpha'-chain  of C3b may become covalently bound at one or two sites in the Fd portion of the heavy chain of IgG.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
6112226;Organization of a multifunctional protein in pyrimidine biosynthesis. Analyses of active, tryptic fragments.;The multifunctional protein which catalyzes the first three steps of pyrimidine biosynthesis in hamster cells can be cleaved by trypsin into enzymatically active fragments. When the fragments are separated by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, three major polypeptide bands appear. Carbamyl phosphate synthetase (EC 2.7.2.9), aspartate transcarbamylase (EC 2.1.3.2), and dihydroorotase (EC 3.5.2.3) activities are associated with 129,000-, 660,000-, and 94,000-dalton bands, respectively. Further analysis of these fragments by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis has shown that the aspartate transcarbamylase band seen on the nondenaturing gel is actually a large aggregate of 39,000-dalton fragments and the dihydroorotase band is a dimer of 44,000-dalton fragments. The data reported here indicate that (i) this multifunctional protein is composed of three enzymatically independent domains, (ii) the sum of the molecular weights of these three domains (129,000 + 39,000 + 44,000 = 212,000) is similar to that of the undigested monomer (220,000 daltons), and (iii) a site important to the formation of the native multimeric protein is probably near the aspartate transcarbamylase domain.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
1748296;Characterization of the aldose reductase-encoding gene family in rat.;Although the enzyme aldose reductase (AR) is implicated in the development of tissue pathology in diabetes, the exact mechanism of this involvement remains unclear. To better understand the role that expression of the aldose reductase-encoding gene (ALR) may play in diabetic complications, we have begun to analyze the gene and its regulatory regions, and we present here the sequence of four ALR genes in the rat. The putative functional gene is 14.1 kb long, has ten exons which show perfect sequence identity to the rat lens AR RNA sequence, and nine introns with classical splice-site consensus sequences. Potential regulatory elements in the 5'-flanking region of this gene include a TATA box and two CCAAT boxes. Probing rat genomic Southern blots with a fragment from the first intron indicates that there is probably only one copy of this gene in the rat genome. The other three genes are processed pseudogenes which show approx. 90% identity to the rat lens AR RNA sequence, contain no introns, and have poly(A) regions at their 3' ends.

9573285;Immunoglobulin G, plasma cells, and lymphocytes in the murine vagina after vaginal or parenteral immunization with attenuated herpes simplex virus type 2.;This investigation evaluated immunity to vaginal herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection after local or parenteral immunization with attenuated HSV-2. Vaginal immunization induced sterilizing immunity against challenge with a high dose of wild-type virus, whereas parenteral immunizations protected against neurologic disease but did not entirely prevent infection of the vagina. Vaginal immunization caused 86- and 31-fold increases in the numbers of immunoglobulin G (IgG) plasma cells in the vagina at 6 weeks and 10 months after immunization, whereas parenteral immunizations did not increase plasma cell numbers in the vagina. Vaginal secretion/serum titer ratios and specific antibody activities in vaginal secretions and serum indicated that IgG viral antibody was produced in the vagina and released into vaginal secretions at 6 weeks and 10 months after vaginal immunization but not after parenteral immunizations. In contrast to the case for plasma cells, the numbers of T and B lymphocytes in the vagina were similar in vaginally and parenterally immunized mice. Also, lymphocyte numbers in the vagina were markedly but similarly increased by vaginal challenge with HSV-2 in both vaginally and parenterally immunized mice. Lymphocyte recruitment to the vagina after virus challenge appeared to involve memory lymphocytes, because it was not observed in nonimmunized mice. Thus, local vaginal immunization with attenuated HSV-2 increased the number of IgG plasma cells in the vagina and increased vaginal secretion/serum titer ratios to 3.0- to 4.7-fold higher than in parenterally immunized groups but caused little if any selective homing of T and B lymphocytes to the vagina.;-;-;-;hard_0
7957052;Specific in vivo association between the bHLH and LIM proteins implicated in human T cell leukemia.;The protein products of proto-oncogenes implicated in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia include two distinct families of presumptive transcription factors. RBTN1 and RBTN2 encode highly related proteins that possess cysteine-rich LIM motifs. TAL1, TAL2 and LYL1 encode a unique subgroup of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins that share exceptional homology in their bHLH sequences. We have found that RBTN1 and RBTN2 have the ability to interact with each of the leukemogenic bHLH proteins (TAL1, TAL2 and LYL1). These interactions occur in vivo and appear to be mediated by sequences within the LIM and bHLH domains. The LIM-bHLH interactions are highly specific in that RBTN1 and RBTN2 will associate with TAL1, TAL2 and LYL1, but not with other bHLH proteins, including E12, E47, Id1, NHLH1, AP4, MAX, MYC and MyoD1. Moreover, RBTN1 and RBTN2 can interact with TAL1 polypeptides that exist in assembled bHLH heterodimers (e.g. TAL1-E47), suggesting that the RBTN proteins can influence the functional properties of TAL1. Finally, we have identified a subset of leukemia patients that harbor tumor-specific rearrangements of both their RBTN2 and TAL1 genes. Thus, the activated alleles of these genes may promote leukemia cooperatively, perhaps as a result of bHLH-LIM interactions between their protein products. ;cysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

Proper functioning of this protein is a prerequisite for normal male sexual differentiation and development. Androgen action is currently studied in vitro, using fibroblasts culture from genital skin and complementary DNA of the androgen receptor gene has been recently cloned and sequenced.

1843406;Genetic analysis of ethylene responses in Arabidopsis thaliana.;The plant hormone ethylene mediates a number of developmental processes and responses to environmental stress in higher plants. Our research efforts over the last three years have been focused on developing an understanding of the molecular basis of ethylene action in plants. To this end, we have isolated mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana with altered responses to ethylene. One such mutant, designated etr, shows no measurable responses to ethylene and has reduced ethylene binding in leaf tissue indicating that the mutation may directly affect the ethylene receptor. We have genetically mapped the etr mutation and by chromosome walking have isolated an 18 kb fragment of genomic DNA that contains the mutant gene. Sequence analysis of cDNAs which map to the 18 kb fragment has produced a candidate for the ETR gene which codes for a putative transmembrane protein kinase. Sequence analysis indicates a domain composed of 9 copies of a 23 amino acid leucine-rich repeat unit and a domain containing a serine/threonine type protein kinase. These two domains are separated by a single 24 amino acid hydrophobic domain.

6798698;Experimental cerebral zygomycosis in alloxan-diabetic rabbits: variation in virulence among zygomycetes.;We investigated the potential of 33 different zygomycete isolates to cause cerebral disease following the intranasal instillation of their spores into ketotic rabbits with alloxan induced diabetes. The isolates represented six thermotolerant species of Rhizopus (R. arrhizus, R. chinensis, R. microsporus, R. oligosporus, R. oryzae, and R. rhizopodiformis), Absidia corymbifera, Cunninghamella bertholletiae, and Rhizomucor pusillus. All 13 isolates of the thermotolerant Rhizopus species proved to be cerebral pathogens as confirmed by culture and histopathology. One isolate of R. oligosporus and one isolate of R. rhizopodiformis, however, were less pathogenic than isolates of other Rhizopus species tested. Cerebral pathogenicity was noted with 2 of 5 isolates of Rh. pusillus and only 1 of 13 A. corymbifera isolates. Two thermotolerant C. bertholletiae cultures, recovered from human lesions, did not cause either cerebral or pulmonary disease in ketotic rabbits. The incidence of pulmonary zygomycosis caused by the isolates of the species of the four genera under study was as follows: Rhizomucor 24%, Rhizopus 22%, Absidia 9%, and Cunninghamella 0%.

9034331;The mammalian profilin isoforms display complementary affinities for PIP2 and proline-rich sequences.;We present a study on the binding properties of the bovine profilin isoforms to both phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and proline-rich peptides derived from vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) and cyclase-associated protein (CAP). Using microfiltration, we show that compared with profilin II, profilin I has a higher affinity for PIP2. On the other hand, fluorescence spectroscopy reveals that proline-rich peptides bind better to profilin II. At micromolar concentrations, profilin II dimerizes upon binding to proline-rich peptides. Circular dichroism measurements of profilin II reveal a significant conformational change in this protein upon binding of the peptide. We show further that PIP2 effectively competes for binding of profilin I to poly-L-proline, since this isoform, but not profilin II, can be eluted from a poly-L-proline column with PIP2. Using affinity chromatography on either profilin isoform, we identified profilin II as the preferred ligand for VASP in bovine brain extracts. The complementary affinities of the profilin isoforms for PIP2 and the proline-rich peptides offer the cell an opportunity to direct actin assembly at different subcellular localizations through the same or different signal transduction pathways.;proline;-;poly-L-;LCR_with_hard
191817;Binding and internalization of thrombin by normal and transformed chick cells.;Thrombin stimulates cell proliferation in cultures of normal chick embryo fibroblasts but not in cells transformed with Rous sarcoma virus. Analysis of medium conditioned by Rous-sarcoma-virus-transformed cultures demonstrates that these cells do not secrete molecules that can inhibit or inactivate thrombin. The interaction of thrombin with these cells was investigated with enzymatically active 125I-thrombin. The amount of cell-associated 125I-thrombin was found to be three times greater with normal cells than with transformed cells. In both types of cell, greater than 50% of the total cell-associated 125I-thrombin was found as a component that was not dissociated from the cells by trypsin treatment, an observation suggesting that a significant portion was not on the cell surface. The amount of the trypsin-insensitive fraction increases with time up to 12 hr, whereas the trypsin-sensitive fraction is saturated after 1-4 hr. Autoradiography of thin sections of 125I-thrombin-treated cells observed by electron microscopy reveals that after 10 hr incubation greater than 70% of the label is localized in the cytoplasm of both normal and transformed cells. Autoradiograms of sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide slab gels demonstrate that 40% of the intracellular label is the size of native thrombin with the remainder in two large fragments of 22,000 and 19,500 daltons.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
2048283;Cloning and expression of a 30 kDa surface antigen of Pasteurella haemolytica.;Pasteurella haemolytica biotype A serotype 1 is the principal etiologic agent of bovine pneumonic pasteurellosis. A clear understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease and the mechanisms of resistance to it has been limited by a lack of information on the important antigens of the organisms. Using recombinant DNA techniques we have cloned a segment of DNA from P. haemolytica A1 that encodes three proteins of 28, 30, and 32 kDa. Two of these proteins, 30 and 28 kDa, react strongly on a Western blot with a bovine serum raised against live cells of P. haemolytica A1. The gene for the 30 kDa protein was localized to a 3.1 kbp EcoRI fragment, and expression of the 30 kDa protein was found to be independent of an E. coli promoter. The 30 kDa protein comigrated with a 30 kDa P. haemolytica protein that was susceptible to radioiodination and presumably exposed on the bacterial cell surface. The other principal radiolabeled P. haemolytica proteins were 100, 45, and 15 kDa. Antibodies against the 30 kDa protein, isolated from E. coli carrying the recombinant plasmid, recognized 30 kDa and 15 kDa proteins in P. haemolytica serotypes 1-15 and caused agglutination of whole P. haemolytica A1 cells. Cattle vaccinated with live P. haemolytica, P. haemolytica outer membrane proteins, or the cloned 30 kDa protein developed antibodies to the cloned 30 kDa protein as detected by Western blotting and densitometry. Sera were obtained from cattle vaccinated with live or killed P. haemolytica or saline and challenged with P. haemolytica. Those sera were evaluated for antibody responses to the cloned 30 kDa protein. High antibody responses to the 30 kDa protein significantly correlated (P less than 0.01) with resistance to challenge. From these studies it is concluded that the 30 kDa protein represents a surface antigen of P. haemolytica A1 that may be important in inducing immunity to P. haemolytica.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
1763063;The E-cadherin promoter: functional analysis of a G.C-rich region and an epithelial cell-specific palindromic regulatory element.;"The cell-cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin is specifically expressed in epithelia and is involved in the maintenance of the epithelial phenotype. Expression of E-cadherin is downregulated in many poorly differentiated carcinomas, which leads to higher motility and invasiveness of the cells. To examine the mechanisms that regulate tissue-specific expression, we have characterized the promoter of the E-cadherin gene. We found that an upstream fragment (positions -178 to +92) mediates strong expression of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene in epithelial cells (i.e., 60% of the level obtained with simian virus 40 promoter/enhancer constructs), whereas in nonepithelial cells this promoter was either inactive or much less active. By DNase I footprinting and gel retardation analysis as well as through functional dissection of the regulatory sequences, we identified two regions that contribute to tissue-specific activity of the promoter: (i) a G-C-rich region between -25 and -58 that generates basic epithelial promoter activity, most likely in combination with an ""initiator"" element present at the single transcription start site of the gene, and (ii) a palindromic sequence between -75 and -86 (named E-pal) that potentiates the activity of the proximal E-cadherin promoter and confers epithelial cell-specific activity on a simian virus 40 promoter. The E-pal sequence is homologous to cis regulatory elements active in keratin gene promoters and competes with these elements for nuclear factor binding. Interestingly, the activity of the E-cadherin promoter was reduced in dedifferentiated breast carcinoma cells, indicating that the identified elements are subject to negative regulation during tumor progression.";cysteine;-;-;LCR_without_function
8110981;Thymocyte proliferation and maturation in response to galactoside-specific mistletoe lectin-1.;Commercially available mistletoe extract standardized for the galactoside-specific mistletoe lectin-1 (ML-1) could be shown to induce thymocyte proliferation and maturation in BALB/c-mice after regular subcutaneous administration of the optimal immunomodulating dosage (1ng lectin/kg body weight). The increase in thymocyte numbers per mg organ weight was statistically significant. Determinations of thymic lymphatic subsets revealed considerable up-regulation of mature cells expressing helper/inducer (L3T4) or cytotoxic/suppressor (Lyt-2) phenotype and immature cells presenting both (L3T4/Lyt-2) antigens. Thus, administration of ML-1 accelerated murine thymocyte proliferation and maturation. Counts of BALB/c-mouse peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) revealed evident (but statistically non-significant) increases after ML-1 administration. The determination of activated PBL expressing interleukin (Il)-2 receptors proved, however, that ML-1 induced a potent immunostimulation since these cells were significantly enhanced after ML-1 administration.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
2428164;Distribution of TPA and cytokeratins in gastrointestinal carcinomas as revealed by immunohistochemistry.;The presence and distribution of tissue polypeptide antigen (TPA) were assessed in gastrointestinal carcinomas of different origin, morphology and degree of differentiation. Immunocytochemistry was employed, using the PAP technique on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material and compared with the results obtained with antibodies to cytokeratins. Like cytokeratins, TPA was a reliable marker of epithelial differentiation and showed tissue distribution patterns similar to cytokeratins, as revealed by antibodies with broad-range cytokeratin immunoreactivity. In most carcinomas, TPA-specific immunostaining was less intense than in non-neoplastic tissue. No direct relationship between intensity of TPA staining and morphological degree of differentiation and proliferation was found. TPA staining was most pronounced at the periphery of the cells. In stratified epithelium, i.e. oesophageal mucosa, basally located cells exceeded superficial cells in TPA immunoreactivity in contrast to the cytokeratin antibodies which decorated the more superficially placed cell layers. TPA and cytokeratin staining patterns were similar in neoplastic and non-neoplastic gastric, intestinal mucosa, as well as in biliary tract epithelium. Antral and cardial mucoid glands of the stomach as well as gastric carcinomas of the pylorocardial type remained unstained with both types of antibodies. Similar staining with TPA and cytokeratin antibodies was also observed in pancreatic and liver tissue. In this study, hepatocytes were, although weakly, stained by TPA antibodies and an identical staining was found with benign and malignant hepatocellular neoplasms. Ductal and ductular TPA-staining was most conspicuous and so was the immunoreactivity of cholangiocellular carcinomas. A comparison between TPA and cytokeratins was also made by immunoblotting which revealed immunoreactivity of antibodies to TPA with cytokeratin polypeptides of different species (man, mouse) and organs (epidermis, liver), particularly with the cytokeratin component 8 of human liver and the related component A of mouse liver. The significance of this finding is uncertain until the pertinent epitopes have been revealed by monoclonal mapping of the components which exhibit similar molecular weights by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3

Chinese scientists have been making efforts for decades towards the development of immunological approach in an attempt to offer alternatives of or supplements to parasitological diagnosis. The authors outline briefly the main advances in the research of immunodiagnosis for schistosomiasis japonica in China in two catalogues: antibody detection and antigen detection. A number of immunodiagnostic assays based on antibody detection, which have been used widely in the control programs in China, are appraised in terms of sensitivity and specificity, and the achievements in the development of immunodiagnostic assays based on antigen detection are introduced. Readers will find some information concerning the efforts so far made by Chinese scientists in the improvement of immunodiagnosis by use of molecular approach, including search for biochemically and/or immunochemically isolated and/or purified antigens, recombinant antigens and anti-idiotypic reagents of diagnostic interest to construct defined antigen-antibody systems for diagnosis, and development of monoclonal antibody-based assays for antibody or antigen detections.;-;antigen;-;hard_2

Precipitates formed in trichloroacetic acid, under controlled conditions, are quantified densitometrically by measuring the proportion of light scattered. The procedure is of particular value in its applicability to smaller polypeptides, with mol.wts. of 3000-6000, which are not fixed adequately in gels by other procedures currently in use.

1023045;Influence of base sequence on the stability of the double helix of DNA.;On the basis of published measurements of the melting transitions of synthetic polydeoxyribonucleotides with known sequences we have determined the parameters of the interplane (stacking) interactions of base pairs in DNA over the range of ionic strengths from 0.01 to 0.1 M Na+. We found that deviations of the stacking-interaction energy from the mean value of 7-8 kcal/mole were extremely small and did not exceed 0.2 kcal/mole. We report an analysis of the influence of the heterogeneity of the stacking interactions on the melting parameters of polynucleotides with random sequences (models of natural DNA's). Inclusion of this effect does not significantly distort the linear dependence of the melting temperature on the relative content of G-C pairs and insignificantly affects the width of the helix-coil transition in DNA under normal conditions. However it is the heterogeneity of the stacking interactions that plays the crucial role in the melting of DNA under conditions where the difference between the relative stabilities of the A-T and G-C pairs tends to zero, as in concentrated solutions of tetraethylammonium and tetramethylammonium salts.;-;helix;-;hard_2

Relationship to début of the disease.;Serum samples from 32 varicella-zoster (VZ)-infected patients were examined for circulating immune complexes (IC) within 1 1/2 week after début of the skin rash as well as during the following 5 weeks. Three test systems were used: a complement consumption (CC) assay, a C1q solid phase (CU1-SP) assay and a polyclonal rheumatoid factor-binding (pRF-I) assay. The CC and pRF-I assays were the most effective in detecting large IgG aggregates of IC, while aggregates of intermediate and small size were more easily demonstrated in the C1q-SP assay. IC were demonstrated in at least 2 assays simultaneously in 16 patients. Four of these patients were IC-positive in both observation periods, while 11 converted to IC-positive in the second observation interval. In 3 patients circulating IC were demonstrable as late as 8--10 weeks after the appearance of the skin rash.

1320178;Long-term follow-up of anti-hepatitis C virus antibodies in patients with acute nonA nonB hepatitis and different outcome of liver disease.;We screened 74 patients with nonA nonB acute hepatitis (37 of post-transfusion PTH, and 37 of non-post-transfusion, NPTH, origin) for the presence of anti-HCV by tests detecting either C100-3 antibodies alone (ELISA I) or C100-3 plus C33c plus C22-3 antibodies (ELISA II). Samples were taken at the onset of disease and then serially for a period of time ranging from 12 to 60 months. An increased number of anti-HCV positive cases (86% vs 69%) and an earlier seroconversion were observed with the second compared to the first generation ELISA. Positive samples were confirmed by recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA), which was also used to study the kinetics of the antibody response to individual HCV antigens. Anti-C33c and anti-C22-3 antibodies were the first detectable markers of HCV infection in 80% and 20% of the patients, respectively. Thirty-two percent of the patients studied showed complete and persistent biochemical recovery, whereas 68% maintained a chronic elevation of the transaminase values. Among the 20 patients who showed early and persistent normalization of the transaminase values, complete disappearance of all antibody reactivities was limited to five of them, whereas in four cases only anti-C100-3 and anti-5-1-1 became negative.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
2612470;A thin-layer multistrip polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis apparatus for Ferguson plot analysis at the submicrogram load level.;A procedure was developed for casting thin-layer multistrip polyacrylamide gels and using them for the simultaneous gel electrophoresis at several gel (Ferguson plot analysis) at the sub-microgram load level, using silver staining, autoradiography and, potentially, blotting for detection. The lower viscosity of polymerization mixtures, compared to agarose gelation mixtures, required the redesign of the multistrip cassette with separation of channels by rubber gaskets and the application of a cassette press. The lowered viscosity also required addition of 35% sucrose and an increased rate of polymerization in application to multistrip gels formed on a common NetFix backing. The present design allows one to obtain Ferguson plots exemplified by those of 32P-labeled DNA followed by autoradiographic detection.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
3872;[Characteristics of heterogeneity of serum albumin in heterosis-hybrid chickens].;A comparative study was performed for isoelectric and electrophoretic spectra blood serum albumin of parental breeds of chickens and their heterosis hybrids --broiler cocks. The method of isoelectric focusing within the surcrose density gradient and pH 4-6 created by the gradient of sucrose, mannitol and boron-borate buffer (pH 8.5) concentrations was applied. The electrophoretic spectrum of the serum albumin fraction homogeneous in the agar gel was obtained by electrophoresis in 7% polyacrylamide gel. The isoelectric spectrum of heterosis hybrid albumin is established to be more heterogeneous and during isoelectric focusing it is divided within a range of pH 4.6-5.2 into seven fractions against four-five components of the parent breed albumin. Among them it is possible to distinguish the fraction involving more than 50% of the total protein (the great component) and some small components with different protein content and belonging wither to a more acid or more basic region as compared to pI of the great component. The pI value of the great component for hybrid albumin is shifted towards the acid region (4.76 against 4.85 and 5.07 in albumin of the parent breeds). Small component of hybrid albumin are characterized by an increase in their amount, but pI of the fraction is within the range of values peculiar to albumin of the maternal and paternal lines. The albumin preparations of all the studied chicken breeds isolated from blood serum by electrophoresis in the agar gel manifest multiplicity of the protein bands in a 7% polyacrylamide gel. The electric spectra of hybrid albumin and parent breeds albumin differ in the distribution pattern of the components and their quantitative composition. A relative electrophoretic mobility of the intensively stained dense band which represents the main electrophoretic component is increased in hydrid albumin with the respect to albumin of the maternal line but is identical to the paternal line.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
6466793;Influence of rheological properties of human bronchial secretions on the ciliary beat frequency.;We studied the relations between the mucociliary beat frequency (MF) measured photometrically on the depleted frog palate and the rheological properties of sputum collected in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. MF was lower (p less than 0.001) with sputa (11.3 +/- 3.3 Hz) than with frog mucus (16.9 +/- 3.3 Hz) used as controls. The relative transport rate (Tr) of sputa was closely correlated (r = 0.81, p less than 0.001) to the relative MF. Significant correlations were observed between MF on the one hand and viscosity (r = -0.68, p less than 0.01), elastic modulus (r = -0.70, p less than 0.01) and spinability (r = +0.49, p less than 0.05) on the other.

Beta-Glucosidase was found to exist as two components having equal molecular weight. Aggregation of the components with inactive proteins probably results in the appearance of multiple native forms which have similar specific activities. In no case separation of the beta-glucosidase activity from the accompanied activities was achieved. It is concluded therefore that these activities are exhibited by an enzyme which is not strictly specific to the C4, C6 stereochemistry for hexosides and to that of C4, C5 for pentozides.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
6810101;Characterization of RNP and Sm ribonucleoprotein nuclear antigens.;Antibodies to the RNase-sensitive RNP and to the RNase-resistant Sm nuclear antigens were used to affinity purify these antigens from a saline extract of rabbit thymus acetone powder. Determination of the protein subunits recovered by either glycine-HCl, pH 2.8, or 2.5 M MgCl2 elution on gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis containing mercaptoethanol revealed that RNP was composed of five proteins with mol. wts from 10,000 to 15,000 whereas Sm contained the same or similar five chains plus six additional subunits with mol. wts from 21,000 to 42,000. RNase treatment of the thymus extract increased the recovery in Sm of the same bands compared to untreated extract. Thus, RNP and Sm appear to have different numbers of protein components and RNP may be a subset of Sm. Sucrose gradient centrifugation of the 125I-labeled, pH 2.8 eluted antigens gave peaks of 3 and 6S for RNP and Sm, respectively. Sucrose gradient centrifugation of the crude untreated thymus extract followed by quantitative single radial immunodiffusion analysis of each fraction produced a broad peak from 16S to the top of the gradient while pretreatment of the extract with RNase resulted in a discrete 6S peak. These results indicate that in rabbit thymus acetone powder native RNP and Sm exist as larger polydisperse complexes with additional material including RNA and that after acid elution or RNase treatment the antigens are found in a smaller monodisperse form.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3

TPPase separation by thin-layer polyacrylamide gel isoelectric focusing (IEF) was also performed using both gray and white matter. TPPase content, chemically determined at pH 9.0, was found to be significantly reduced in the frontal cortex of ALS and PD patients compared to controls. TMPase content, on the contrary, was unchanged. IEF analysis showed 9 clear-cut bands with TPPase activity in the pH range 5.4-7.2 and a broad band at pH 4.7-5.2.

HepG2 cells which express a galactose specific membrane lectin were efficiently and selectively transfected with pSV2Luc/lactosylated polylysine complexes in a sugar dependent manner: i) HepG2 cells which do not express membrane lectin specific for mannose were quite poorly transfected with pSV2Luc/mannosylated polylysine complexes, ii) HeLa cells which do not express membrane lectin specific for galactose were not transfected with pSV2Luc/lactosylated polylysine complexes. The transfection efficiency of HepG2 cells with pSV2Luc/lactosylated polylysine complexes was greatly enhanced either in the presence of chloroquine or in the presence of a fusogenic peptide. A 22-residue peptide derived from the influenza virus hemagglutinin HA2 N-terminal polypeptide that mimics the fusogenic activity of the virus, was selected.

1849427;Histone hyperacetylation does not alter the positioning or stability of phased nucleosomes on the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat.;Activation of mouse mammary tumor virus transcription by the hormone-bound glucocorticoid receptor results in disruption of a nucleosome that is specifically positioned on the promoter. Limited treatment of cells with the histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate prevents receptor-dependent promoter activation and nucleosome disruption [Bresnick, E. H., John, S., Berard, D. S., LeFebvre, P., & Hager, G. L. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 3977-3981]. On the basis of this observation, we undertook a series of experiments to compare the structure of normal and hyperacetylated mouse mammary tumor virus chromatin. Although butyrate prevents hormone-induced restriction enzyme cutting specifically in the B nucleosome region, chromatin containing hyperacetylated histones does not differ from normal chromatin in general sensitivity to restriction enzymes. Indirect end-labeling analysis of micrococcal nuclease digested chromatin reveals that nucleosomes are identically phased on the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat in normal and hyperacetylated chromatin. A synthetic DNA fragment spanning the B nucleosome region was reconstituted into a monosome by using core particles containing normal or hyperacetylated histones. Analysis of the structure of reconstituted monosomes by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, salt stability, thermal stability, restriction enzyme accessibility, and exonuclease III or DNase I footprinting reveals no effect of histone hyperacetylation on monosome structure. These observations suggest that histone hyperacetylation does not induce a major change in the structure of mouse mammary tumor virus chromatin, such as nucleosome unfolding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS);-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
25274774;Nuclear localization of MBNL1: splicing-mediated autoregulation and repression of repeat-derived aberrant proteins.;In some neurological diseases caused by repeat expansions such as myotonic dystrophy, the RNA-binding protein muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1) accumulates in intranuclear inclusions containing mutant repeat RNA. The interaction between MBNL1 and mutant RNA in the nucleus is a key event leading to loss of MBNL function, yet the details of this effect have been elusive. Here, we investigated the mechanism and significance of MBNL1 nuclear localization. We found that MBNL1 contains two classes of nuclear localization signal (NLS), a classical bipartite NLS and a novel conformational NLS. Alternative splicing of exon 7 acts as a switch between these NLS types and couples MBNL1 activity and intracellular localization. Depending on its nuclear localization, MBNL1 promoted nuclear accumulation of mutant RNA containing a CUG or CAG repeat, some of which produced proteins containing homopolymeric tracts such as polyglutamine. Furthermore, MBNL1 repressed the expression of these homopolymeric proteins including those presumably produced through repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation. These results suggest that nuclear retention of expanded RNA reflects a novel role of MBNL proteins in repressing aberrant protein expression and may provide pathological and therapeutic implications for a wide range of repeat expansion diseases associated with nuclear RNA retention and/or RAN translation. ;glutamine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
9080886;Tolerance of mefloquine by SwissAir trainee pilots.;Due to presumed adverse performance impact, a World Health Organization clause currently restricts the use of mefloquine malaria chemoprophylaxis in individuals requiring fine coordination and spatial discrimination. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study to quantitatively assess the effects of mefloquine at steady state on performance in 23 trainee airline pilots. Flying performance was assessed using a flight simulator, psychomotor function was evaluated, sleep and wake cycles were monitored, and symptoms and moods were assessed using standardized questionnaires. A simplified postural sway meter recorded sway in three test positions. In the mefloquine loading dose phase, there was one withdrawal due to dizziness, diarrhea, and flu-like symptoms, and three volunteers reported nonserious, sleep-related adverse events. There was no significant difference in flying performance, psychomotor functions, or mean sway for any test position. Nonsignificant reductions in mean total nocturnal sleep (mefloquine = 450 min versus placebo = 484 min) and poorer sleep quality were detected in the mefloquine phases.

8065932;Cloning, chromosomal mapping and characterization of the human metal-regulatory transcription factor MTF-1.;Metallothioneins (MTs) are small cysteine-rich proteins that bind heavy metal ions such as zinc, cadmium and copper with high affinity, and have been functionally implicated in heavy metal detoxification and radical scavenging. Transcription of metallothioneins genes is induced by exposure of cells to heavy metals. This induction is mediated by metal-responsive promoter elements (MREs). We have previously cloned the cDNA of an MRE-binding transcription factor (MTF-1) from the mouse. Here we present the human cDNA equivalent of this metal-regulatory factor. Human MTF-1 is a protein of 753 amino acids with 93% amino acid sequence identity to mouse MTF-1 and has an extension of 78 amino acids at the C-terminus without counterpart in the mouse. The factors of both species have the same overall structure including six zinc fingers in the DNA binding domain. We have physically mapped the human MTF-1 gene to human chromosome 1 where it localizes to the short arm in the region 1p32-34, most likely 1p33. Both human and mouse MTF-1 when produced in transfected mammalian cells strongly bind to a consensus MRE of metallothionein promoters. However, human MTF-1 is more effective than the mouse MTF-1 clone in mediating zinc-induced transcription. ;cysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
28974443;Toxicological aspects of the interesterified-fat from processed foods: Influences on opioid system and its reward effects in rats.;Considering the high consumption of processed foods, interesterified fat (IF) has been used to replace trans fat, since it may harm nervous system functions. Opioids are intensely used to alleviate pain, and have a highly addictive potential. Therefore, their improper use is related to addiction, tolerance, and withdrawal syndrome. Wistar rats received soybean oil (SO) or IF during gestation, lactation and post-weaning until pups' adolescence. On post-natal day 39, animals received morphine (4 mg/kg i.p.) in the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm. SO group showed morphine preference during drug withdrawal, while IF group showed no preference or withdrawal symptoms, but higher sensitivity to thermal stimuli than SO group. Morphine contidioning increased dopamine 1 receptor (D1R) and NMDAR: N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) immunoreactivity in the hippocampus of SO, whereas these molecular changes were not observed in IF group. Regardless of morphine conditioning, IF group showed increased Kappa opioid receptor (KOR) immunoreactivity in the spinal cord, evidencing a negative correlation with thermal sensitivity.

The latter data have been continuously collected since 1986 to evaluate Switzerland's strategy to prevent AIDS. About fifty per cent of drug users are in steady relationships, which is a smaller proportion than among average young adults. On the other hand, occasional sexual contacts (whether or not a steady relationship exists) are three times as frequent among drug users. The use of condoms is slightly more frequent here than among the average population, but is not as yet-and especially among those who are HIV-positive-consistent enough by any means. The influence of drug abuse on sexuality is usually felt to be negative (decline in libidinal energy, impotence), and often brings about a decrease in sexual contacts. This is equally true of both opiates and stimulants (cocaine, amphetamine). Promiscuous behaviour is rare as such and does not occur with any greater frequency than among the average population. However, a large proportion of drug users is at some stage exposed to prostitution. In summary, one can say that the preventive strategy continues to be deficient where the sexual activities of drug users are concerned. A greater effort should be made, in this context, to target the following groups: persons already frequenting advice centers, persons who are HIV-positive, and male prostitutes.";-;-;-;hard_0
7287756;Partial structural characterization of the cytoplasmic domain of the erythrocyte membrane protein, band 3.;"The cytoplasmic domain of band 3 was released from spectrin-depleted, acetic acid-stripped erythrocyte membrane vesicles by mild chymotryptic digestion. After purification by ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography, the fragment preparation was found to be greater than 90% pure on polyacrylamide disc gels in the presence of 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate. The subunit Mr from the electrophoretic procedure was estimated at approximately 40,000. The isolated cytoplasmic fragment ws judged to be a dimer, since (i) the unmodified fragment and its disulfide-cross-linked (dimeric) counterpart eluted in the same peak fraction from a Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration column, and (ii) the sedimentation velocity molecular weight of the native fragment was calculated to be approximately 95,000. No evidence of either larger or smaller aggregates was obtained. The frictional ratio of the fragment was measured at 1.6, suggesting a highly elongated morphology. The circular dichroism spectrum of the fragment corresponded to approximately 37% alpha helix. Titration of the cytoplasmic fragment over the physiological pH range gave rise to a reversible 2-fold increase in the intrinsic fluorescence quantum yield (lambda ex, 290 nm; lambda em, 335 nm) between pH 6 and 9. Computer analysis of the data yielded a temperature-dependent apparent pKa of 7.8 at 37 degrees C and 8.1 at 20 degrees C, both with Hill coefficients less than or equal to 1. Calorimetric experiments revealed a similar sensitivity to pH, where the denaturation temperature of the fragment titrated from 74 degrees C at pH 6 to 59 degrees C at pH 8.5, with an apparent pKa of 7.3 and a Hill coefficient less than 1. The enthalpies and widths at half-height of the transitions were also exquisitely sensitive to pH. The fluorescence and calorimetric data could all be described by the titration of a single ionizable group of apparent pKa of 7.8 at 37 degrees C and delta pKa/degrees C of -0.018. The ionization of this critical group is suggested to exert significant control over the structure/stability of the cytoplasmic domain of band 3.";-;helix;polyacrylamide;hard_3
8400669;Natural killer activity and serum immunosuppressive acidic protein levels in esophageal and gastric cancers.;The natural killer (NK) activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and serum immunosuppressive acidic protein (IAP) levels were examined in patients with esophageal or gastric cancer, before and after surgery. Patients with stage IV esophageal or stage IV gastric cancer had significantly lower NK activity (39.5 +/- 14.8% and 37 +/- 11.6%, respectively), and also higher serum IAP levels (778 +/- 264 micrograms/mL and 633 +/- 156 micrograms/mL, respectively), than the corresponding control values (50 +/- 5.6% and 375 +/- 26 micrograms/mL, respectively). Patients with esophageal or gastric cancer who underwent curative resection had high NK activity (54.8 +/- 11.6% and 54.8 +/- 8.0%, respectively), and low IAP levels (471 +/- 116 micrograms/mL and 490 +/- 42 micrograms/mL, respectively), compared with those who underwent non-curative resection. Patients who underwent non-curative resection had lower NK activity and higher serum IAP levels than those who underwent curative resection, even 1 month after surgery. Mononuclear cells in the regional lymph nodes and tumor specimens showed significantly lower NK activity than those in the peripheral blood and spleen. Thus, NK activity and the IAP level reflected the immunocompetence, clinical course, and surgical curability of those patients. NK cells appeared not to have any significant antitumor activity in the regional lymph nodes or in the tumor itself, although they were still active in the peripheral blood.;-;-;-;hard_0
25340519;Trypanosoma cruzi evades the protective role of interferon-gamma-signaling in parasite-infected cells.;The protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi is responsible for the zoonotic Chagas disease, a chronic and systemic infection in humans and warm-blooded animals typically leading to progressive dilated cardiomyopathy and gastrointestinal manifestations. In the present study, we report that the transcription factor STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1) reduces the susceptibility of human cells to infection with T. cruzi. Our in vitro data demonstrate that interferon -γ (IFNγ) pre-treatment causes T. cruzi-infected cells to enter an anti-parasitic state through the activation of the transcription factor STAT1. Whereas stimulation of STAT1-expressing cells with IFNγ significantly impaired intracellular replication of parasites, no protective effect of IFNγ was observed in STAT1-deficient U3A cells. The gene encoding indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (ido) was identified as a STAT1-regulated target gene engaged in parasite clearance. Exposure of cells to T. cruzi trypomastigotes in the absence of IFNγ resulted in both sustained tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and its increased DNA binding. Furthermore, we found that in response to T. cruzi the total amount of intracellular STAT1 increased in an infectious dose-dependent manner, both at the mRNA and protein level. While STAT1 activation is a potent strategy of the host in the fight against the invading pathogen, amastigotes replicating intracellularly antagonize this pathway by specifically promoting the dephosphorylation of STAT1 serine 727, thereby partially circumventing its protective effects. These findings point to the crucial role of the IFNγ/STAT1 signal pathway in the evolutionary combat between T. cruzi parasites and their host.;-;transcription factor;-;hard_2
1993665;Identification and characterization of RNA polymerase sigma factor from Micrococcus luteus.;The promoters of Micrococcus luteus, a bacterium whose chromosomal DNA has a high G + C content (74%), diverge from the consensus prokaryotic promoter in having GC-rich DNA sequences at less important positions (Nakayama, M., Fujita, N., Ohama, T., Osawa, S., and Ishihama, A. (1989) Mol. Gen. Genet. 218, 384-389). In order to compare the promoter selectivity of RNA polymerase between M. luteus and Escherichia coli, we purified the enzyme from both organisms. The sets of promoters recognized by the two RNA polymerases were found to overlap partly. Some, but not all, E. coli promoters were found to be correctly transcribed in vitro by M. luteus RNA polymerase as well as the E. coli enzyme. One molecular species of M. luteus sigma factor, with the apparent molecular mass of 60 kDa, was isolated from purified RNA polymerase. By the addition of either M. luteus or E. coli core enzyme it was reconstituted into active holoenzyme. Likewise, M. luteus core enzyme was reconstituted into a hybrid holoenzyme by the addition of E. coli sigma subunit. Both hybrid holoenzymes were, however, able to initiate transcription only from promoters which were recognized by both of the native holoenzymes.;cysteine;-;-;LCR_without_function
9419755;Estrogen mustard induces cell cycle arrest of human epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines.;"OBJECTIVE
Pharmacologic disruption of microtubule function may provide effective therapy for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer, as has been observed in clinical trials using taxol. However, the limited availability of taxol and taxol's side effects emphasize a need to develop alternative antimicrotubule agents. Estramustine (EM) inhibits binding of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) to microtubules, promotes microtubule disassembly, disrupts spindle formation, and induces metaphase arrest in human prostate carcinoma and glioma cells in culture. We studied the effect of EM on DNA synthesis and on the cell cycle in four human ovarian carcinoma cell lines and examined the cell lines for evidence of MAP-like immunoreactivity.


METHODS
The effect of EM on DNA synthesis and on the cell cycle was determined using [3H]thymidine incorporation assays and flow cytometry, respectively. Microtubule-associated protein-like immunoreactivity was determined using monoclonal antibodies directed against MAP 1A, MAP 1B, and MAP 2(2A + 2B) for Western analysis after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.


RESULTS
We demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibitory response to EM in BIXLER, DK2NMA, and SKOV3. BIX3 showed a dose-dependent inhibitory response to EM concentrations from 25 micrograms/mL to 100 micrograms/mL, but a stimulatory response at 10 micrograms/mL. Estramustine inhibited exponentially growing cells by causing mitotic arrest with subsequent accumulation of cells in G2/M phase of the cell cycle in all four cell lines. We found MAP 1A, MAP 1B, and MAP 2-like immunoreactivity in all four cells lines studied.


CONCLUSIONS
These results are consistent with a MAP-microtubule mechanism of action for EM in ovarian carcinoma cells and provide reason to conduct further study of EM for potential use in the treatment of human epithelial ovarian cancer.";-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
2293709;Rapid and selective cloning of monitor peptide, a novel cholecystokinin-releasing peptide, using minimal amino acid sequence and the polymerase chain reaction.;cDNA transcripts encoding rat monitor peptide (MP) have been cloned from a lambda-ZAP-II phage library using minimal specific amino acid sequence (six residues), the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and multivalent PCR probes to distinguish MP transcripts from those that encode a closely related peptide, pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor. DNA sequence analysis of 3 cDNA transcripts, MP1-3, revealed the complete amino acid sequence of the prepeptide (79 residues) including an 18-residue hydrophobic signal sequence at the NH2 terminus. Sequence divergence in both coding and 3' noncoding regions indicates a potential exon-exon junction with alternative splicing, which results in a truncated peptide with Arg 58 at the COOH terminus as well as alternative selection of poly(A) signals, respectively. The 5' nontranslated region of MP1 mRNA (282 nucleotides (nt] contains four upstream ATGs. Conserved structure between MP and anionic trypsinogen mRNAs within 9 nt immediately upstream of the AUG initiation codon may be involved in coupling the expression of MP with anionic trypsinogen, a condition which appears to be required to monitor the intake of dietary protein in the rat.;alanine;-;-;LCR_without_function
7576252;Posttranslational mitochondrial protein import in a homologous yeast in vitro system.;Posttranslational import of preproteins into mitochondria has been reported to be inefficient in a homologous yeast in vitro system, suggesting a requirement for coupling of protein synthesis and import. We have characterized a homologous yeast in vitro system which allows posttranslational mitochondrial import of preproteins. The efficiency is comparable to that of the heterologous system with rabbit reticulocyte lysate and isolated yeast mitochondria. Import in the homologous system depends on mitochondrial surface receptors, a membrane potential and the matrix heat shock protein Hsp70. Import is not blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, but is impaired by induction of stable folding in preproteins. Our studies demonstrate a posttranslational translocation mechanism in the homologous system, strongly supporting the validity of conclusions drawn from the widely used heterologous import system.;-;-;-;hard_0
1371446;Characterization of binding sites for oxyntomodulin on a somatostatin-secreting cell line (RIN T3).;Oxyntomodulin (OXM), a glucagon-containing peptide extended at its C-terminal end by an octapeptide, is a potent inhibitor of gastric acid secretion in rat and man. OXM appears to act on gastric mucosa at least partially through a stimulation of gastric somatostatin release. We have investigated the effects of OXM on a somatostatin-secreting cell line (RIN T3) derived from a radiation-induced rat insulinoma and characterized specific binding sites for this peptide. OXM increased somatostatin release with an ED50 of 2.3 nM. OXM also stimulated the cAMP accumulation in intact RIN T3 cells and adenylate cyclase activity in RIN T3 cell membranes with ED50 values of 0.5 and 11 nM, respectively. On these parameters, glucagon was 10-30 times less potent than OXM. Forskolin, isobutylmethylxanthine, and 8-bromo-cAMP mimicked the effect of OXM on somatostatin release. Specific binding for mono-[125I]OXM was dependent upon time and membrane concentration. Binding of mono-[125I]OXM was inhibited by OXM and glucagon in a concentration-dependent manner, with dissociation constants (Kd) of 4.5 and 43 nM, respectively. The nonhydrolyzable analogs of GTP (guanosine 5',3-O-(thio)triphosphate and guanosine 5' (beta,gamma-imino)triphosphate decreased the binding of mono-[125I]OXM to its binding sites. Covalent cross-linking of mono-[125I]OXM or mono-[125I]glucagon to RIN T3 cell membranes followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated a single radiolabeled band at 63,000 mol wt, which differed from that observed after cross-linking with liver plasma membranes (55,000 mol wt). These results demonstrate the presence of specific high affinity binding sites for OXM in a somatostatin-secreting cell line (RIN T3) and their coupling to adenylate cyclase via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
1370607;Alteration of the kinetic properties of the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase by basic proteins.;Previous studies have shown that lysine- and arginine-rich proteins can enhance the activity of tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinases. However, the kinetics and mechanism of this activation are not fully understood. Therefore we investigated the ability of poly(amino acids) and the arginine-rich protein, protamine, to alter the kinetic properties of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor protein-tyrosine kinase activity using immunoaffinity-purified receptor isolated from human epidermoid carcinoma (A431) cells. Poly(L-lysine), poly(L-arginine) and protamine stimulated EGF receptor kinase activity by 3-5-fold at non-saturating doses of ATP and peptide substrate, while poly(L-glutamate) had no effect. Initial kinetic studies demonstrated an increase in the maximum velocity and a decrease in the apparent Km for the peptide substrate angiotensin II in the presence of the basic effectors. Further analysis of the kinetic mechanism by product inhibition revealed that protamine altered the pattern of ADP inhibition towards the peptide substrate but not towards ATP. The change was indicative of the receptor's ability to form an enzyme-angiotensin II-ADP ternary complex in the presence of protamine but not in its absence. In addition, the basic effectors had a substantially decreased influence on the kinase activity of a C-terminally truncated form of the EGF receptor. Thus the changes in kinase activity may be partially mediated by the C-terminal region of the receptor, which contains the sites of receptor self-phosphorylation. These results suggest that the basic domains of proteins can interact with the EGF receptor to induce changes in its kinetic properties, especially with regard to reactant recognition and binding.;arginine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
10518579;Selective expression of the large neutral amino acid transporter at the blood-brain barrier.;Amino acid supply in brain is regulated by the activity of the large neutral amino acid transporter (LAT) at the brain capillary endothelial cell, which forms the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in vivo. Bovine BBB poly(A)(+) RNA was isolated from 2.0 kg of fresh bovine brain and size fractionated on a sucrose density gradient, and a size-fractionated bovine BBB cDNA library in the pSPORT vector was prepared. The full-length cDNA encoding the bovine BBB LAT was isolated from this library, and the predicted amino acid sequence was 89-92% identical to the LAT1 isoform. The bovine BBB LAT1 mRNA produced a 10-fold enhancement in tryptophan transport into frog oocytes coinjected with bovine BBB LAT1 mRNA and the mRNA for 4F2hc, which encodes the heavy chain of the heterodimer. Tryptophan transport into the mRNA-injected oocytes was sodium independent and was specifically inhibited by other large neutral amino acids, and the K(m) of tryptophan transport was 31.5 +/- 5.5 microM. Northern blotting with the bovine BBB LAT1 cDNA showed that the LAT1 mRNA is 100-fold higher in isolated bovine brain capillaries compared with C6 rat glioma cells or rat brain, and the LAT1 mRNA was not detected in rat liver, heart, lung, or kidney. These studies show that the LAT1 transcript is selectively expressed at the BBB compared with other tissues, and the abundance of the LAT1 mRNA at the BBB is manyfold higher than that of transcripts such as the 4F2hc antigen, actin, or the Glut1 glucose transporter.;-;antigen;poly(A)(+) RNA;hard_3
25906737;Design and Stereoselective Synthesis of ProM-2: A Spirocyclic Diproline Mimetic with Polyproline Type II (PPII) Helix Conformation.;With the aim of developing polyproline type II helix (PPII) secondary-structure mimetics for the modulation of prolin-rich-mediated protein-protein interactions, the novel diproline mimetic ProM-2 was designed by bridging the two pyrrolidine rings of a diproline (Pro-Pro) unit through a Z-vinylidene moiety. This scaffold, which closely resembles a section of a PPII helix, was then stereoselectively synthesized by exploiting a ruthenium-catalyzed ring-closing metathesis (RCM) as a late key step. The required vinylproline building blocks, that is, (R)-N-Boc-2-vinylproline (Boc=tert-butyloxycarbonyl) and (S,S)-5-vinylproline-tert-butyl ester, were prepared on a gram scale as pure stereoisomers. The difficult peptide coupling of the sterically demanding building blocks was achieved in good yield and without epimerization by using 2-(1H-7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU)/N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA). The RCM proceeded smoothly in the presence of the Grubbs II catalyst. Stereostructural assignments for several intermediates were secured by X-ray crystallography. As a proof of concept, it was shown that certain peptides containing ProM-2 exhibited improved (canonical) binding towards the Ena/VASP homology 1 (EVH1) domain as a relevant protein interaction target. ;proline;helix;-;LCR_with_function
8965805;Accessibility to minors of cigarettes from vending machines--Broward County, Florida, 1996.;The sale of tobacco products to persons ages < 18 years has been prohibited by law in Florida since October 1992, and since May 1994, a statewide law in Florida has required retailers or owners of businesses that sell cigarettes or other tobacco products to post a conspicuous sign stating that tobacco sales to minors are illegal and that proof of age is required to purchase tobacco products. To assess the impact of these laws in Broward County (1990 population: 1,255,531) during February-March 1996, the Florida Atlantic University Department of Exercise Science/Wellness Education conducted studies of vendor compliance with laws enacted to prevent minors from gaining access to cigarettes through vending machines and to ensure that tobacco vendors comply with the sign statute.

8586705;PCR and single-strand conformational polymorphism for recognition of medically important opportunistic fungi.;The application of PCR technology to molecular diagnostics holds great promise for the early identification of medically important pathogens. PCR has been shown to be useful for the detection of the presence of fungal DNA in both laboratory and clinical samples. Considerable interest has been focused on the utility of selecting universal primers, those that recognize constant regions among most, if not all, medically important fungi. Once an amplicon, or piece of amplified DNA determined by the unique pair of oligonucleotide primers, has been generated, several different methods may be used to distinguish between genera and between species. The two major approaches have utilized differences in restriction enzyme digestion patterns or hybridization with specific probe. We report the application of single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) as a technique to delineate the differences between fungal species and/or genera. Minor sequence variations in small single-stranded DNA cause subtle changes in conformation, allowing these strands to be separated on polyacrylamide gels by SSCP. We used a 197-bp fragment amplified from the 18S rRNA gene, common to all medically important fungi. After amplification, the fragments were denatured and run on an acrylamide-glycerol gel at room temperature or 4 degrees C for 4.5 or 4 h, respectively. Under room temperature conditions, the SSCP patterns for Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, and Candida parapsilosis were identical and all strains within each species demonstrated the same pattern. These patterns differed markedly from those of the genus Aspergillus. The SSCP patterns of major and minor bands at room temperature permitted distinction between strains of Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus flavus. There also was consistency of the SSCP banding pattern among different strains of the same Aspergillus species. The SSCP patterns for other medically important opportunistic fungi, such as Cryptococcus neoformans, Pseudallescheria boydii, and Rhizopus arrhizus, were sufficiently unique to permit distinction from those of C. albicans and A. fumigatus. We conclude that the technique of PCR-SSCP provides a novel method by which to recognize and distinguish medically important opportunistic fungi and which has potential applications to molecular diagnosis, taxonomic classification, molecular epidemiology, and elucidation of mechanisms of antifungal drug resistance.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1

In vitro polyadenylated virion RNA was an effective matrix in reverse transcription reaction with RNA-dependent DNA-polymerase using oligo (dT) as a primer.

22050230;Ammonia increases nitric oxide, free Zn(2+), and metallothionein mRNA expression in cultured rat astrocytes.;Ammonia is a major player in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and affects astrocyte function by triggering a self-amplifying cycle between osmotic and oxidative stress. We recently demonstrated that hypoosmotic astrocyte swelling rapidly stimulates nitric oxide (NO) production and increases intracellular free Zn(2+) concentration ([Zn(2+)](i)). Here we report effects of ammonia on [Zn(2+)](i) homeostasis and NO synthesis. In cultured rat astrocytes, NH(4)Cl (5 mm) increased within 6 h both cytosolic and mitochondrial [Zn(2+)]. The [Zn(2+)](i) increase was transient and was mimicked by the nonmetabolizable CH(3)NH(3)Cl, and it was dependent on NO formation, as evidenced by the sensitivity toward the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N(G)-monomethyl-l-arginine. The NH(4)Cl-induced NO formation was sensitive to the Ca(2+) chelator 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetra(acetoxymethyl) ester and increases in both NO and [Zn(2+)](i) were blocked by the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist MK-801. The NH(4)Cl-triggered increase in [Zn(2+)](i) was followed by a Zn(2+)-dependent nuclear appearance of the metal response element-binding transcription factor and metallothionein messenger RNA (mRNA) induction. Metallothionein mRNA was also increased in vivo in rat cerebral cortex 6 h after an NH(4)Ac challenge. NH(4)Cl increased peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) protein expression, whereas PBR mRNA levels were decreased in a Zn(2+)-independent manner. The Zn(2+)-dependent upregulation of metallothionein following ammonia intoxication may reflect a cytoprotective response, whereas the increase in PBR expression may augment HE development.;-;transcription factor;-;hard_2
8898961;Antigenicity of HIV-derived T helper determinants in the context of carrier recombinant proteins: effect on T helper cell repertoire selection.;T helper (Th) epitopes can be included in a recombinant protein with B and CTL epitopes to create more effective immunogens. To determine whether the antigenicity of HIV Th epitopes is preserved in this altered molecular context, human Th clones specific for peptides of HIV gp120 and reverse transcriptase p66 were challenged with recombinant proteins carrying the antigenic epitopes in different sites. We found that a given epitope was recognized by a specific T cell clone only when it was inserted in a particular position of the carrier. However, the permissive position was not the same for all epitopes. Enzymatic excision from a nonpermissive context or insertion of a polyserine spacer between the epitope and the carrier restored antigenicity. Nevertheless, antigenicity was not abolished in a synthetic peptide encompassing the epitope and the neighboring residues from the nonpermissive location. These data suggest that, in this case, the primary sequence of the chimeric protein flanking the HIV peptide is not responsible for loss of antigenicity. Furthermore, constructs carrying the epitope in a given position were recognized by peptide-specific Th clones raised from some individuals, but not from others. We show that this is due neither to individual modes of processing nor to the use of distinct major histocompatibility complex MHC class II restriction elements, but rather that it is related to the fine specificity of the clones. To study the effect of epitope context on selection of T cell repertoire in a naive individual, T cell lines were generated in vitro by stimulation with different peptide constructs. This resulted in the induction of diverse clonotypes defined by the pattern of recognition of different constructs, by T cell receptor V beta gene usage and by fine epitope mapping. ;serine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
2659528;Monoclonal antibody-mediated protection and neutralization of motility in experimental Proteus mirabilis infection.;A panel of monoclonal antibodies with specificity for a wound isolate of Proteus mirabilis was established. Of nine antibodies studied in detail, three were broadly reactive with various Proteus isolates, while six reacted in a serotype-specific fashion with the strain used for immunization. Five of the six serotype-specific antibodies were reactive with lipopolysaccharide. The sixth serotype-specific antibody, 4-F (immunoglobulin G1 [IgG1]), was potently protective in a burn wound sepsis model and recognized a protein antigen. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot (immunoblot) analysis were used to determine that 4-F was reactive with flagellar protein. Approximately 1.3 micrograms of the antibody was sufficient to provide protection against 8 50% lethal doses of wound isolate, and approximately 26 micrograms provided full protection against challenge with 333 50% lethal doses. In vitro test results indicated that 4-F inhibited the motility of the wound isolate, and in vivo testing showed that it inhibited dissemination of the inoculum from the burn site to the liver and spleen. Whereas the antibody was highly effective in preventing the death of mice subsequent to challenge at a burn site, no protection was seen following an intraperitoneal challenge. These results may therefore indicate that the protection observed in the burn model is solely a reflection of the capacity of 4-F to neutralize bacterial motility.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
25011696;Modelling the structure of full-length Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1.;Epstein-Barr virus is a clinically important human virus associated with several cancers and is the etiologic agent of infectious mononucleosis. The viral nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA1) is central to the replication and propagation of the viral genome and likely contributes to tumourigenesis. We have compared EBNA1 homologues from other primate lymphocryptoviruses and found that the central glycine/alanine repeat (GAr) domain as well as predicted cellular protein (USP7 and CK2) binding sites are present in homologues in the Old World primates, but not the marmoset, suggesting that these motifs may have co-evolved. Using the resolved structure of the C-terminal one-third of EBNA1 (homodimerization and DNA binding domain), we have gone on to develop monomeric and dimeric models in silico of the full-length protein. The C-terminal domain is predicted to be structurally highly similar between homologues, indicating conserved function. Zinc could be stably incorporated into the model, bonding with two N-terminal cysteines predicted to facilitate multimerisation. The GAr contains secondary structural elements in the models, while the protein binding regions are unstructured, irrespective of the prediction approach used and sequence origin. These intrinsically disordered regions may facilitate the diversity observed in partner interactions. We hypothesize that the structured GAr could mask the disordered regions, thereby protecting the protein from default degradation. In the dimer conformation, the C-terminal tails of each monomer wrap around a proline-rich protruding loop of the partner monomer, providing dimer stability, a feature which could be exploited in therapeutic design. ;proline;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
9023102;Forced evolution of a regulatory RNA helix in the HIV-1 genome.;The 5'and 3'end of the HIV-1 RNA genome forms a repeat (R) element that encodes a double stem-loop structure (the TAR and polyA hairpins). Phylogenetic analysis of the polyA hairpin in different human and simian immunodeficiency viruses suggests that the thermodynamic stability of the helix is fine-tuned. We demonstrated previously that mutant HIV-1 genomes with a stabilized or destabilized hairpin are severely replication-impaired. In this study, we found that the mutant with a destabilized polyA hairpin structure is conditionally defective. Whereas reduced replication is measured in infections at the regular temperature (37 degrees C), this mutant is more fit than the wild-type virus at reduced temperature (33 degrees C). This observation of a temperature-dependent replication defect underscores that the stability of this RNA structure is critical for function. An extensive analysis of revertant viruses was performed to further improve the understanding of the critical sequence and structural features of the element under scrutiny. The virus mutants with a stabilized or destabilized hairpin were used as a starting point in multiple, independent selections for revertant viruses with compensatory mutations. Both mutants reverted to hairpins with wild-type stability along various pathways by acquisition of compensatory mutations. We identified 19 different revertant HIV-1 forms with improved replication characteristics, providing a first look at some of the peaks in the total sequence landscape that are compatible with virus replication.

3510183;GAL3 gene product is required for maintenance of the induced state of the GAL cluster genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.;The activities of the first three enzymes for galactose catabolism normally become detectable within 15 min after the addition of galactose into a culture of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Temperature shift experiments with one of those mutants led to the conclusion that the GAL3 function is required not only for the initiation of enzyme induction but also for the maintenance of the induced state in galactose-nonfermenting S. cerevisiae because of a defect in any of the genes for the galactose-catabolizing enzymes, such as gal1 or gal10. In contrast, the GAL3 function is phenotypically dispensable in galactose-metabolizing S. cerevisiae. Thus, the normal catabolism of galactose can substitute for the GAL3 function.;-;-;-;hard_0

9393193;Cerebral venography: comparison of CT and MR projection venography.;"OBJECTIVE
The purpose of the study was to show equivalence or superiority of CT venography compared with the existing test of choice--MR venography--in the evaluation of dural sinus thrombosis and in the identification of cerebral veins and dural sinuses.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Twenty-four patients underwent both CT and MR venography of the intracranial venous circulation. Seventeen patients were examined for suspected dural sinus thrombosis. Four patients underwent projection venography to assess tumor invasion of a major dural sinus. The remaining three patients were examined for cavernous sinus thrombosis, arteriovenous malformation, and an elevated jugular bulb. Without knowledge of the patients' case histories, two radiologists evaluated each CT venogram and MR venogram. The radiologists then arrived at a consensus regarding the absence or presence of dural sinus thrombosis. Later, the radiologists conducted a second interpretation with knowledge of the patients' clinical histories during which time MR and CT venograms were compared with regard to the advantages and disadvantages of each imaging technique. In addition, the venograms were assessed for the presence of 12 different venous structure. Projection venograms were displayed using a maximum-intensity-projection (MIP) algorithm, and the individual source images were also evaluated. The CT venograms were also displayed using shell-MIP and integral display algorithms.


RESULTS
Using MR venography, the two radiologists diagnosed dural sinus thrombosis in eight of the 17 patients with suspected dural sinus thrombosis. In these eight patients, the diagnosis was also made with CT venography. The diagnosis was confirmed by follow-up CT in four patients and by follow-up MR imaging in two patients. The MIP algorithm did not allow direct visualization of thrombus by either the CT or the MR imaging technique; however, the CT integral display algorithm enabled direct visualization of thrombus on the three-dimensional projection venograms. The systematic comparison of imaging techniques showed that CT venography reliably reveals all cerebral veins and sinuses when they are seen with MR venography. In addition, CT venography more frequently visualizes sinuses or smaller cerebral veins with low flow as compared with MR venography.


CONCLUSION
Cerebral CT venography is superior to MR venography in the identification of cerebral veins and dural sinuses and is at least equivalent in the diagnosis of dural sinus thrombosis. CT venography is a viable alternative to MR venography in the examination of patients with suspected dural sinus thrombosis.";-;-;-;hard_0
8125994;The sequence of a second member of the lima bean lectin gene family and the expression and characterization of recombinant lectin in Escherichia coli.;The lima bean lectin recognizes terminal alpha-D-GalNAc groups and agglutinates human type A erythrocytes. We have cloned a portion of the gene encoding the alpha subunit of the lima bean lectin. The clone was obtained using the polymerase chain reaction and verified from a genomic clone encoding the mature protein of 253 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence has significant overall homology with other leguminous plant lectins and contains all of the known peptide sequences isolated from lima bean lectin (LBL). Southern blot analysis reveals the presence of several genes which hybridize to the cloned gene and which we propose are genes included in the lima bean lectin gene family. We report here the sequence, expression, and characterization of LBL 2, the second member of this gene family. Milligram quantities of soluble active recombinant lima bean lectin (rLBL) were obtained from Escherichia coli, using the T7 RNA polymerase expression system. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis indicate expression of one protein band of about 27 kDa in induced E. coli cells. This protein cross-reacts with polyclonal antibodies raised against seed lectin (sLBL) and gave a reaction of identity with seed lectin by Ouchterlony double diffusion, specifically agglutinates type A blood cells, and is specifically inhibited by D-GalNAc. The isoelectric point of rLBL is 5.86, whereas those of the seed lectin subunits were determined to be 5.86, 5.58, and 5.20 (previously designated alpha, beta, alpha', respectively). rLBL binds to hydrophobic ligands independent of sugar binding, an observation similar to results obtained with sLBL. However, despite the similar activities described, several significant differences between recombinant and native lima bean lectin were found, including mobility on gel filtration, aggregation in solution, and its CD spectrum. These differences may be due to a number of factors, which will be discussed.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
8638540;TPA, TATI, CEA, AFP, beta-HCG, PSA, SCC, and CA 19-9 for monitoring transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.;A total of 76 patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder were prospectively monitored with simultaneous serum value estimations of tumor polypeptide antigen (TPA), tumor-associated trypsin inhibitor (TATI), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-HCG), prostatic specific antigen (PSA), squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC), and CA 19-9 in different stages and phases of their disease. In locally advanced disease positive values were noted for TATI in 22/28 patients (78.5%), for TPA in 17/28 (60.7%), for CA 19-9 in 10/28 (35.7%), for CEA 11/28 (39.2%), for beta-HCG in 3/28 (10.7%), for PSA in 6/28 (21.4%), for SCC in 6/28 (21.4%), and for AFP in 0/28. In metastatic disease elevated levels were observed for TATI in 43/48 patients (89.5%), for TPA in 41/48 (85.4%), for CA 19-9 in 19/48 (39.5%), for CEA in 20/48 (41.6%), for beta-HCG in 6/48 (12.5%), for PSA in 7/48 (14.5%), for SCC in 8/48 (16.6%), and for AFP in 1/48 (2.1%). In metastatic disease TATI and TPA values were significantly modified in patients with complete remission and TATI, TPA, and CA 19-9 in patients with partial remission and nonresponders. In T2-T4-N0M0 tumors, TPA, TATI, CA 19-9, and CEA were significantly increased in nonresponders. In patients with complete remission, a change in serum TATI, TPA, and CA 19-9 levels cannot be evidenced with the available numbers. The concurrent determination of TATI and TPA in T2-T4N0M0 tumors and TATI, TPA, and CA 19-9 in generalized disease could predict the response to chemotherapy. This study indicates that only the determination of TATI and TPA and in some degree the CA 19-9 is a potential tool for monitoring the efficacy of treatment.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
6383484;Subcellular fractionation of actively growing protoplasts of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.;Cell homogenates obtained from partially regenerated Saccharomyces cerevisiae protoplasts were fractionated by a procedure using a combination of continuous and discontinuous sucrose gradients, under experimental conditions that minimize possible artifacts due to centrifugation and resuspension. At least five different membranous organelle fractions (plasma membrane, mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticulum, smooth endoplasmic reticulum-like structures and small-sized particulated structures) were isolated. Subcellular fractions were characterized by assaying established marker enzymes. Radioactive labelled [(U-3H]uracil) ribosomes were also used as a further characterization criterion of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Comparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the protein constituents of the isolated membrane-bound organelles suggest that the polypeptide pattern could also be used as an additional marker for some of these structures. Finally, subcellular distribution of chitin synthase was determined using this fractionation procedure, and two partially zymogenic enzyme pools (one inside the cell associated to particles which sediments at high speed, and the second one associated to the plasma membrane) were found.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
435274;Computed resolution and relative specific radioactivities of radiolabelled proteins synthesized by isolated gastric mucosal cells.;1. By radiolabelling, polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate and fluorography, more than 50 soluble proteins in the molecular-weight range 15000-100000 were shown to continue to be synthesized after cells had been isolated from rat gastric mucosa. 2. Densitometric measurements of stained gels and fluorographic films were processed by computer to resolve individual overlapping Gaussian peaks corresponding to the protein bands. 3. Comparison of resolved peak areas of radioactivity and staining showed certain bands to have characteristically high relative specific radioactivities. 4. The computer programs (in FORTRAN) permit the analysis of a single densitometric trace or the simultaneous comparison of a corresponding pair of densitometric records of stained gels, or of fluorographic films, or a combination. Central processing unit time is used economically. 5. The programs identify the Gaussian components that contribute to the records and estimate their means, standard deviations and enclosed areas. These estimates are improved by a piecewise iterative method that minimizes the errors between the calculated and the experimental data. 6. Relative specific radioactivities are calculated as the normalized ratio of the area of a fluorographic film peak and the area of the corresponding stained gel peak.

8576164;Promoter sequences in the RI beta subunit gene of cAMP-dependent protein kinase required for transgene expression in mouse brain.;Neural-specific expression of the mouse regulatory type-I beta (RI beta) subunit gene of cAMP-dependent protein kinase is controlled by a fragment of genomic DNA comprised of a TATA-less promoter flanked by 1.5 kilobases of 5'-upstream sequence and a 1.8-kilobase intron. This DNA contains a complex arrangement of transcription factor binding motifs, and previous experiments have shown that many of these are recognized by proteins found in brain nuclear extract. To identify sequences critical for RI beta expression in functional neurons, we performed a deletion analysis in transgenic mice. Evidence is presented that the GC-rich proximal promoter is responsible for cell type-specific expression in vivo because RI beta DNA containing as little as 17 base pairs (bp) of 5'-upstream sequence was functional in mouse brain. One likely regulatory element coincides with the start of transcription and includes an EGR-1 motif and 3 consecutive SP1 sites within a 21-bp interval. Maximal RI beta promoter activity required the adjacent 663 bp of 5'-upstream DNA where most, but not all, of the regulatory activity was localized between position -663 and -333. A 37-bp direct repeat lies within this region that contains 2 basic helix-loop-helix binding sites, each of which are overlapped by two steroid hormone receptor half-sites, and a shared AP1 consensus sequence. Intron I sequences were also tested, and deletion of a 388-bp region containing numerous Sp1-like sequences lowered transgene activity significantly. These results have identified specific regions of the RI beta promoter that are required for the expression of this signal transduction protein in mouse neurons. ;cysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
1016237;Re-activation of the peptidyltransferase centre of rabbit reticulocyte ribosomes after inactivation by exposure to low concentrations of magnesium ion.;1. The larger subrivosomal particles of rabbit reticulocytes retained full activity in the puromycin reaction and in poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis after 4h at 0 degrees C when buffered 0.5M-NH4Cl/10-30mM-MgCl2 was the solvent. 2. Activity in the puromycin reaction was diminished to approx 10% after 15-30 min at 0 degrees C when the concentration of MgCl2 was lowered to 2mM. 3. Activity was not restored when the concentration of MgCl2 was raised from 2mM to 10-30 mM at 0 degrees C. However, activity was recovered as measured by both assay systems when the ribosome fraction was heated to 37 degrees C at the higher concentrations of MgCl2. 4. Recovery of activity was noted during the course of the polyphenylalanine synthesis in 50 mM-KCl/5mM-MgCl2/25mM-Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, at 37 degrees C. Re-activation was slow at 20 degrees C and below. 5. No more than about 5% of the protein moiety of the subparticle was lost in 0.5M-NH4Cl on decreasing MgCl2 concentration from 10mM to 2mM. No proteins were detected in the supernatant fractions by gel electrophoresis after ribosomes were separated by differential centrifugation. The supernatant fraction was not essential for the recovery of activity. However, at higher (e.g. 1M) concentrations of NH4Cl, proteins were split from the subparticle. 6. The loss and regain of activity found on lowering and restoring the concentration of MgCl2 at 0.5M-NH4Cl appears to arise from a conformational change that does not seem to be associated with a loss and regain of particular proteins. 7. A 2% decrease in E260 was noticed when the concentration of Mg2+ was restored, and the change in the spectrum indicated a net increase of approx. 100A-U base-pairs per subribosomal particle. 8. When the concentration of Mg2+ was restored, S20,W of the subparticle remained at 52+/- 1S until the sample was incubated at 37 degrees C when S20,W increased to 56 +/- 1S compared with the value of 58 +/- 1S for the subparticle as originally isolated.;phenylalanine;-;-;LCR_without_function
6641713;Secretion of the hepatitis B virus surface antigen from mouse cells using an extra-chromosomal eucaryotic vector.;Recombinant DNA molecules which contained a subgenomic fragment of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome, the pML2 vector and the bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV) genome were constructed. The HBV fragment includes the entire transcription unit for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). After propagation in Escherichia coli, the recombinant plasmids were cleaved with endonucleases SalI and PvuI to eliminate most of the bacterial sequences before transfection of mouse C127 cells. Foci were observed 10--14 days after transfection. Cells from selected foci were cloned and the supernatants were assayed for the presence of HBsAg. Most of the clones tested were found to secrete HBsAg particles into the growth medium. These particles appear to be similar to the 22 nm particles present in the serum of HBV chronic carriers. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the particles contain two polypeptides, probably representing the glycosylated and unglycosylated forms of the HBsAg major polypeptide. An analysis of DNA from the transformed clones revealed that they contain multiple extra-chromosomal copies of the recombinant, which, however, had suffered rearrangement.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3

Similar complexes of f2 phage RNA or tRNA did not induce anti-nucleic acid antibodies. Each anti-polynucleotide serum contained some antibodies specific for double-stranded structure. Antibodies were immunospecifically purified from precipitates made with each serum and homologous or cross-reacting double-stranded polynucleotides. The purified antibodies distinguished among varying helices bearing base or ribose modifications. Antipoly(I).poly(BC) specificity paralleled that of the interferon induction system. Anti-poly(A).poly(Um) specificity favored the 2'-modified polymers. Anti-poly(c7A).poly(rT) antibodies were the least discriminating. Cross-reaction results indicated that some antibodies reacted with determinants that included both sugar-phosphate backbones. In far antibody excess, antigen:antibody ratios in precipitating complexes reached a minimum of 7 to 12 base pairs per bivalent IgG molecule.

20110359;The 90-kDa heat shock protein Hsp90 protects tubulin against thermal denaturation.;Hsp90 and tubulin are among the most abundant proteins in the cytosol of eukaryotic cells. Although Hsp90 plays key roles in maintaining its client proteins in their active state, tubulin is essential for fundamental processes such as cell morphogenesis and division. Several studies have suggested a possible connection between Hsp90 and the microtubule cytoskeleton. Because tubulin is a labile protein in its soluble form, we investigated whether Hsp90 protects it against thermal denaturation. Both proteins were purified from porcine brain, and their interaction was characterized in vitro by using spectrophotometry, sedimentation assays, video-enhanced differential interference contrast light microscopy, and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Our results show that Hsp90 protects tubulin against thermal denaturation and keeps it in a state compatible with microtubule polymerization. We demonstrate that Hsp90 cannot resolve tubulin aggregates but that it likely binds early unfolding intermediates, preventing their aggregation. Protection was maximal at a stoichiometry of two molecules of Hsp90 for one of tubulin. This protection does not require ATP binding and hydrolysis by Hsp90, but it is counteracted by geldanamycin, a specific inhibitor of Hsp90.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1

To clear the paddock, the wild boars were lured by offered food and caught using specially built smaller pens. They were then transported to a location far off their original surroundings and euthanized. Of a total of 297 wild boars kept in the paddock, 71% were caught and 28% shot. Three wild boars (= 1%) were found trapped. The described method could also be used in case of epidemics to catch wild boars living outside existing paddocks. In order to avoid killing the boars which stayed in separate quarantine enclosures, a darting gun was used to anaesthetize the animals with tiletamine/zolazepam. Achieved sedation levels were deep enough to allow for blood samples to be taken from the jugular vein without any problems, i.e. without any defence reactions of the boars.

7890769;Epidermal growth factor stimulation of the human gastrin promoter requires Sp1.;Growth factors coordinately regulate a variety of different genes to stimulate cellular proliferation. In the stomach, gastrin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and transforming growth factor-alpha all mediate gastric mucosal homeostasis by promoting cell renewal. We have previously shown that EGF and phorbol esters stimulate the human gastrin promoter through a novel GC-rich DNA element 5'-(68)GGGGCGGGGTGGGGGG-53 called gERE (gastrin EGF response element). In this report, we show that three factors bind to this element, the transcription factor Sp1 and two fast migrating complexes designated gastrin EGF response proteins (gERP 1 and 2). To understand how these factors bind and confer EGF responsiveness, mutations of gERE were tested in vitro for protein binding and in vivo for promoter activation. Both gel shift assays and UV cross-linking studies revealed that the factors bind to overlapping domains, Sp1 to the 5' half-site and gERP 1 and 2 to the 3' half-site. Placing either the 5' or 3' mutations upstream of a minimal gastrin promoter abolished EGF induction. Therefore both the 5' and 3' domains were required to confer EGF induction. Collectively, these results demonstrate that complex interactions between Sp1 and other factors binding to overlapping gERE half-sites confer EGF responsiveness to the gastrin promoter.;cysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
2861194;Cloning and sequencing of a Moraxella bovis pilin gene.;Moraxella bovis pili have been shown to play a major role in both infectivity and protective immunity of bovine infectious keratoconjunctivitis. Sonicated M. bovis DNA from the piliated strain EPP63 was inserted into the vector lambda gt11 with EcoRI linkers. Recombinant phage were screened with an oligonucleotide probe based on the amino-terminal portion of the DNA sequence of a Neisseria gonorrhoeae pilin gene. Two candidate phages produced a protein that comigrated with EPP63 beta pilin in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and bound anti-pilus antisera. The 1.9-kilobase insert from one of these, lambda gt11M182, was subcloned in both orientations into pBR322, forming the plasmids pMxB7 and pMxB9, both of which produced beta pilin, as did pMxB12, a HindIII deletion derivative of pMxB7. In HB101(pMxB12), the M. bovis pilin protein was shown to be primarily localized in the inner membrane. The entire 939-base-pair insert of pMxB12 was sequenced, revealing a ribosome binding site just upstream of the coding region and an AT-rich region further upstream containing some potential RNA polymerase recognition sites. The translation of the sequence predicts a six-amino-acid leader sequence preceding the phenylalanine that begins the mature protein. Codon usage analysis of the M. bovis beta pilin gene revealed greater use of the CUA codon for leucine than usual for a well-expressed Escherichia coli gene.

2901335;Coding sequence and expression of the homeobox gene Hox 1.3.;We have characterized Hox 1.3 (previously described as m2), a murine homeobox-containing gene, which is a member of the Hox 1 cluster located on chromosome 6. A cloned cDNA was isolated from an Okayama-Berg library generated from the chemically transformed cell line MB66 MCA ACL6. The protein sequence of 270 amino acids was deduced from the nucleotide sequence of an open reading frame containing the homeobox. The open reading frame is interrupted at the genomic level by a 960 bp intron and is organized in two exons. The Hox 1.3 protein was found to contain extensive sequence homology with the murine homeodomain protein Hox 2.1, which is encoded on chromosome 11. There are two homology with the regions in the first exon, i.e. a hexapeptide conserved in many homeobox-containing genes and the N-terminal domain, which was found to be homologous only to Hox 2.1. Furthermore, in exon 2 the homologies of the homeodomain regions are extended up to the carboxy terminus of Hox 1.3 and Hox 2.1. During prenatal murine development, maximal expression of Hox 1.3 is observed in 12-day embryonic tissue. The two transcripts carrying the Hox 1.3 homeobox are 1.9 kb and about 4 kb in length. An abundant Hox 1.3-specific 1.9 kb RNA is also found in F9 cells which were induced for parietal endoderm differentiation, whereas F9 teratocarcinoma stem cells do not stably express this specific RNA. Induction of the transcript occurs immediately after retinoic acid/cAMP treatment and the RNA level remains high for 5 days. Thus, the kinetics are different from the previously described homeobox transcripts Hox 1.1 and Hox 3.1. Interestingly, by analogy to the F9 cell system a negative correlation between transformation and Hox 1.3 expression is observed in 3T3 fibroblasts also. Untransformed 3T3 cells carry abundant 1.9 kb Hox 1.3 RNA, whereas the methylcholanthrene-transformed MB66 and LTK- cells or 3T3 cells transformed by the oncogenes src, fos or SV40 T antigen express only low levels.;-;antigen;-;hard_2

2640481;[Immunologic studies in thalassemia major].;It is accepted that the immune alterations in patients with thalassemia major (TM) are secondary to the continuous transfusion-related antigenic stimulation together with iron overload. We evaluated the immune status of TM patients and found quantitative alterations in the distribution of peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations as well as functional alterations in natural killer (NK) cytotoxicity, B-cell differentiation, T-cell immunoregulation and phagocyte functional activities. TM patients, 10 years old or younger, have a lymphocyte profile and phagocytic activity similar to normal controls. Non-splenectomized thalassemic patients, older than 10, present lymphocytosis due to an increase in B lymphocytes and with splenectomy the T-CD8+ lymphocytes increase. With respect to phagocytes, the capacity to ingest candida is preserved while the candidacidal activity and the generation of toxic oxygen metabolites during the respiratory burst are diminished, and are inversely proportional with age and serum ferritin concentration, that is, older in age and higher in iron overload, more profound are the phagocyte dysfunctions. The altered B-cell function, the dysfunction of T immunoregulatory cells and the defective NK activity observed in TM patients were independent of the age of the patients and they were observed even in children younger than 10 years old and in general are attributed to blood transfusions. Moreover, there are some alterations that thalassemic carriers can express such as a defect at the level of NK and at B-cell function regulations, suggesting a possible genetic origin. Although complex, TM constitutes a human model that allows the dissection of specific immune defects, involving multiple factors, and can provide a better comprehension of how this complex immunoregulatory system works.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
11395494;Identification of Sam68 arginine glycine-rich sequences capable of conferring nonspecific RNA binding to the GSG domain.;Sam68 is an RNA-binding protein that contains a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K homology domain embedded in a larger RNA binding domain called the GSG (GRP33, Sam68, GLD-1) domain. This family of proteins is often referred to as the STAR (signal transduction and activators of RNA metabolism) proteins. It is not known whether Sam68 is a general nonspecific RNA-binding protein or whether it recognizes specific response elements in mRNAs with high affinity. Sam68 has been shown to bind homopolymeric RNA and a synthetic RNA sequence called G8-5 that has a core UAAA motif. Here we performed a structure function analysis of Sam68 and identified two arginine glycine (RG)-rich regions that confer nonspecific RNA binding to the Sam68 GSG domain. In addition, by using chimeric proteins between Sam68 and QKI-7, we demonstrated that one of the Sam68 RG-rich sequences of 26 amino acids was sufficient to confer homopolymeric RNA binding to the GSG domain of QKI-7, another STAR protein. Furthermore, that minimal sequence can also give QKI-7 the ability (as Sam68) to functionally substitute for HIV-1 REV to facilitate the nuclear export of RNAs. Our studies suggest that neighboring RG-rich sequences may impose nonspecific RNA binding to GSG domains. Because the Sam68 RNA binding activity is negatively regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation, our data lead us to propose that Sam68 might be a specific RNA-binding protein when tyrosine phosphorylated. ;glycine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

After the gel is copper stained and photographed it is simply destained and then equilibrated in transfer buffer prior to immunoblotting. We find that this treatment has no significant effect on transfer efficiency or band sharpness and is compatible with all common detection methods for the blotted proteins. It thus permits the separation of proteins to be checked in a simple way before immunoblotting is performed.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
8394446;Chronic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection stimulates distinct NF-kappa B/rel DNA binding activities in myelomonoblastic cells.;"The relationship between human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and the induction of NF-kappa B binding activity was examined in a myeloid cell model of HIV-1 infection derived from the PLB-985 cell line. Chronic infection of PLB-985 cells led to increased monocyte-specific surface marker expression, increased c-fms gene transcription, and morphological alterations consistent with differentiation along the monocytic pathway. PLB-IIIB cells displayed a constitutive NF-kappa B-like binding activity that was distinct from that induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment of the parental PLB-985 cell line. This unique DNA binding activity consisted of proteins of 70, 90, and 100 kDa with a high degree of binding specificity for the NF-kappa B site within the PRDII domain of beta interferon. In this report, we characterize the nature of these proteins and demonstrate that binding of these proteins is also induced following Sendai paramyxovirus infection. The 70-kDa protein corresponds to the NF-kappa B RelA (p65) subunit, which is activated in response to an acute paramyxovirus infection or a chronic HIV-1 infection. Virus infection does not appear to alter the amount of RelA (p65) or NFKB1 (p50) but rather affects the capacity of I kappa B alpha to sequester RelA (p65), therefore leading to constitutive levels of RelA DNA binding activity and to increased levels of NF-kappa B-dependent gene activity. The virally induced 90- to 100-kDa proteins have a distinct binding specificity for the PRDII domain and an AT-rich sequence but do not cross-react with NF-kappa B subunit-specific antisera directed against NFKB1 (p105 or p50), NFKB2 (p100 or p52), RelA (p65), or c-rel. DNA binding of the 90- to 100-kDa proteins was not inhibited by recombinant I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 and was resistant to tryptic digestion, suggesting that these proteins may not be NF-kappa B related. Transient cotransfection experiments demonstrated that RelA and NFKB1 expression maximally stimulated HIV-1 LTR- and NF-kappa B-dependent reporter genes; differences in NF-kappa B-like binding activity were also reflected in higher constitutive levels of NF-kappa B-regulated gene expression in HIV-1-infected myeloid cells.

We wanted to determine whether measuring BCR-ABL1 mRNA doubling-times (DTs) could distinguish inconsequential rises in the oncogene's expression from resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Thus, we retrospectively examined BCR-ABL1 evolution in 305 chronic-phase CML patients receiving imatinib mesylate (IM) as a first line treatment. Patients were subdivided in two groups: those with a confirmed rise in BCR-ABL1 transcripts without MR3.0 loss and those failing IM. We found that the DTs of the former patients were significantly longer than those of patients developing IM resistance (57.80 vs. 41.45 days, p = 0.0114). Interestingly, the DT values of individuals failing second-generation (2G) TKIs after developing IM resistance were considerably shorter than those observed at the time of IM failure (27.20 vs. 41.45 days; p = 0.0035). We next wanted to establish if decreases in BCR-ABL1 transcripts would identify subjects likely to obtain deep molecular responses. We therefore analyzed the BCR-ABL1 halving-times (HTs) of a different cohort comprising 174 individuals receiving IM in first line and observed that, regardless of the time point selected for our analyses (6, 12, or 18 months), HTs were significantly shorter in subjects achieving superior molecular responses (p = 0.002 at 6 months; p < 0.001 at 12 months; p = 0.0099 at 18 months). Moreover, 50 patients receiving 2G TKIs as first line therapy and obtaining an MR3.0 (after 6 months; p = 0.003) or an MR4.0 (after 12 months; p = 0.019) displayed significantly shorter HTs than individuals lacking these molecular responses. Our findings suggest that BCR-ABL1 DTs and HTs are reliable tools to, respectively, identify subjects in MR3.0 that are failing their assigned TKI or to recognize patients likely to achieve deep molecular responses that should be considered for treatment discontinuation.";-;-;-;hard_0
2826478;The c1 repressor of bacteriophage P1. Isolation and characterization of the repressor protein.;The c1 repressor gene of bacteriophage P1 is located on P1 DNA EcoRI fragment 7 (Sternberg, N. (1979) Virology 96, 129-142). Subfragments of P1 DNA EcoRI fragment 7 were cloned into expression vectors, and the c1 repressor protein from P1 wild-type phage and a revertant of a temperature-sensitive repressor mutant were overproduced in Escherichia coli and purified to near-homogeneity. The decreased electrophoretic mobility of P1 DNA BamHI fragment 9 in the presence of appropriate protein fractions was used as an assay for the repressor protein. Highly purified repressor migrates as a single polypeptide on denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, corresponding to a molecular weight of about 33,000. A molecular weight of about 63,000 for the native repressor molecule was calculated from determinations of the sedimentation coefficient, which was 2.6 s, and the Stokes radius, which was 55 A. Cross-linking the protein with glutaraldehyde yielded two bands. These data and a high frictional coefficient (2.1) suggest that the native repressor exists in solution as an asymmetric dimer molecule.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
8435209;Effect of whole body hyperthermia on cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II)-induced antitumour activity and tissue Pt-distribution: do anaesthetics influence the therapeutic ratio?;Thermal enhancement of cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (DDP)-mediated antitumour activity and normal tissue toxicities by whole body hyperthermia were compared in a F344 rat model under different anaesthetic conditions. Whole body hyperthermia (WBH: 120 min at 41.5 degrees C) enhanced both DDP-mediated antitumour activity and toxic side-effects. Our present study shows that anaesthetics might influence the thermal enhancement ratios (TER) calculated for DDP-mediated normal tissue toxicity but did not influence the TER calculated for antitumour activity. The TER calculated for DDP-mediated antitumour activity was 2.9. As a result of the anaesthetics used, the TER calculated for kidney and gastrointestinal toxicity ranged from 1.8 to 4.5 and from 1.2 to 2.3, respectively. The TER estimated for DDP-mediated general toxicities varied between 2.9 and 4.0 for weight loss, and from 2.0 to 2.3 based on the LD50. The differential effect of anaesthetics on TER calculated for antitumour activity and normal tissue toxicity led to different therapeutic ratios. For example the therapeutic ratio for combined WBH and DDP, using kidney damage as an end-point for normal tissue damage, ranged from 0.6 (without anaesthesia) to 1.6 (using nembutal as anaesthetic). The significantly elevated platinum levels in serum, kidney, jejunum and tumour tissue after WBH treatment may explain the thermal enhancement of DDP-mediated antitumour activity and side-effects but no correlation could be found for the differences in DDP-mediated normal tissue toxicities induced by the anaesthetics.;-;-;-;hard_0
19102625;T-cell activation by antigen-loaded pH-sensitive hydrogel particles in vivo: the effect of particle size.;Polymeric carriers designed to encapsulate protein antigens have great potential for improving the efficacy of vaccines and immunotherapeutics for diseases such as cancer. We recently developed a carrier system based on polyacrylamide hydrogel microparticles cross-linked with acid-labile moieties. After being phagocytosed by antigen-presenting cells, the protein encapsulated within the carrier is released and processed for subsequent presentation of antigenic epitopes. To understand the impact of particle size on the activation of T-cells following uptake by antigen-presenting cells, particles with mean diameters of 3.5 microm and 35 nm encapsulating a model protein antigen were synthesized by emulsion and microemulsion based polymerization techniques, respectively. In vivo tests demonstrated that both sizes of particles were effective at stimulating the proliferation of T-cells and were capable of generating an antigen-specific cytotoxic T-cell response when coadministered with immunostimulatory DNA. Contrary to previous reports in the literature, our results suggest that there is no significant difference in the magnitude of T-cell activation for the two sizes of particles used in these experiments. This disparity in findings may be related to fundamental differences in material properties of the carriers used in these studies, such as the hydrophilicity of the polyacrylamide particles described here versus the hydrophobic nature of carriers investigated by other groups.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
6316923;Receptor-mediated endocytosis of proteoglycans by human fibroblasts involves recognition of the protein core.;Endocytosis by cultured human skin fibroblasts of 35SO4(2-)-labelled or [3H]leucine-labelled proteoglycans from fibroblast secretions and of 125I-proteodermatan sulphate from pig skin was quantitatively investigated. The following results were obtained. (1) Core proteins prepared by digestion with chondroitin ABC lyase were at least as efficiently endocytosed as native proteoglycans. Pig skin proteodermatan sulphate was a competitive inhibitor of endocytosis of 35SO4(2-)-labelled proteoglycans. (2) Proteoglycans produced in the presence of tunicamycin and native proteoglycans degraded with endoglycosaminidase H were internalized at a normal rate. Several monosaccharides that can be bound by mammalian lectins were unable to influence the internalization of proteoglycans. Treatment of proteoglycans with neuraminidase, however, resulted in an increased clearance rate. (3) Reductive methylation or acetoacetylation of lysine residues was accompanied by a parallel decrease in the rate of proteoglycan endocytosis. Reversal of acetoacetylation normalized the uptake properties. Endocytosis of native proteoglycans was also reduced in the presence of poly-L-lysine, and this reduction in endocytosis was observed as well with proteoglycans synthesized in the presence of the lysine analogue S-2-aminoethylcysteine. These results suggest that the recognition marker required for receptor-mediated endocytosis of proteodermatan sulphate resides in its protein moiety and involves lysine residues.;-;-;poly-L-;hard_1

The map quality was better when obtained at higher pH values; the peaks became sharper and higher against the background. We failed to obtain maps of partial denaturation at pH 5.5, T less than TAT. The improvement of the map quality and existence of the partial denaturation maps at T less than TAT at pH 10.9 were explained by the increase of primary melting probability of AT-rich DNA regions. At high pH the denaturation map quality was temperature independent. This was explained by a very weak temperature dependence of primary melting probability for all maps of equal quality. The map quality became worse, when the quantity of loops was increased.";threonine;-;-;LCR_without_function
10072610;FK506 with portal decompression exerts beneficial effects following extended hepatectomy in dogs.;The present study was designed to elucidate the effectiveness of portal decompression and FK506 (FK) pretreatment in extended hepatectomy in dogs. In the first set of experiment the effect of portal decompression was evaluated in two groups of dogs which underwent extended hepatectomies (80%) with or without (control) a side-to-side portacaval shunt. The presence of the shunt significantly (p < 0.05) improved the 7-day survival of the animals (57.1%) when compared with those of the control group (28.6%) and eventually the portal pressure was significantly lower and mean arterial pressure was significantly higher in the shunt group (p < 0. 05). Moreover, the animals with lower portal pressure (</=220 mm of saline) had a significantly improved 7-day survival rate than those with higher portal pressure (p < 0.001). To evaluate the role of FK pretreatment in extended hepatectomy, a more severe model of 90% hepatectomy was used in four different groups: portacaval shunt, shunt and FK pretreatment, FK pretreatment, and hepatectomy only (control). Although the shunt improved the survival rate in the 80% hepatectomy model, neither shunt (8.3%) nor FK pretreatment (0%) independently improved the survival of the animals when the hepatectomy was extended to 90%. FK pretreatment significantly improved the survival (33.3%, p < 0.05) and hepatic functions of the animals only in the presence of a shunt. Also hepatic microcirculation measured with a laser Doppler flowmeter was significantly better in the remnant liver of all treated groups than in the control group (p < 0.01). In conclusion, extended hepatectomy (90%) could be performed in otherwise normal liver after FK pretreatment and a side-to-side portacaval shunt, which improve the regenerative response in a stable hemodynamic animal.;-;-;-;hard_0
18787695;The genome of Borrelia recurrentis, the agent of deadly louse-borne relapsing fever, is a degraded subset of tick-borne Borrelia duttonii.;In an effort to understand how a tick-borne pathogen adapts to the body louse, we sequenced and compared the genomes of the recurrent fever agents Borrelia recurrentis and B. duttonii. The 1,242,163-1,574,910-bp fragmented genomes of B. recurrentis and B. duttonii contain a unique 23-kb linear plasmid. This linear plasmid exhibits a large polyT track within the promoter region of an intact variable large protein gene and a telomere resolvase that is unique to Borrelia. The genome content is characterized by several repeat families, including antigenic lipoproteins. B. recurrentis exhibited a 20.4% genome size reduction and appeared to be a strain of B. duttonii, with a decaying genome, possibly due to the accumulation of genomic errors induced by the loss of recA and mutS. Accompanying this were increases in the number of impaired genes and a reduction in coding capacity, including surface-exposed lipoproteins and putative virulence factors. Analysis of the reconstructed ancestral sequence compared to B. duttonii and B. recurrentis was consistent with the accelerated evolution observed in B. recurrentis. Vector specialization of louse-borne pathogens responsible for major epidemics was associated with rapid genome reduction. The correlation between gene loss and increased virulence of B. recurrentis parallels that of Rickettsia prowazekii, with both species being genomic subsets of less-virulent strains. ;threonine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
4038696;Some functional characteristics of purified bovine interphotoreceptor retinol-binding protein.;"Interphotoreceptor retinol-binding protein (IRBP) is a unique retinol carrier: it is a large glycoprotein existing only in the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM), which is the extracellular material situated between and behind the photoreceptors of the neural retina. IRBP from bovine and human eyes carries endogenous retinol, as evidenced by the protein's fluorescence on gel-filtration (Sephacryl S-300) chromatography and on native (non-SDS) pore-gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Bovine IRBP's retinol-binding sites are at most one-third occupied in light-adapted eyes and much less in dark-adapted eyes; this bleach dependence is partially reversible and suggests a role in vitamin A transport during the visual cycle. IRBP can be saturated with exogenous all-trans retinol; one ligand molecule binds per protein molecule. IRBP can be isolated rapidly from IPM by affinity adsorption onto con A-Sepharose; this preparation is 94% pure and yields 0.33 mg or 2.4 nmol of IRBP per bovine eye. An apparently homogeneous preparation can be obtained by subsequent passage through a Sepharose 4B column. IRBP is located only in the IPM, which is harvested by isotonic washing of the retina. (In the absence of this rinse to prepare IPM, the protein is found loosely associated with the retina, although not as a cellular or membrane component.) As the thoroughness of the retinal washing procedure is increased, the yield of IPM proteins (including IRBP) goes up; however, the same set of proteins, in the same ratios, always is retrieved, indicating that retinal-cell components do not contaminate seriously the IPM.";-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1

This region is located in the Poços de Caldas Plateau, one of the largest weathered alkaline intrusions in the world.

8584042;BIMT 17, a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist and 5-HT1A receptor full agonist in rat cerebral cortex.;In the search for antidepressant agents with a rapid onset of action, we have found that compound BIMT 17 (1-[2-[4-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazin-1- yl]ethyl]benzimidazol-[1H]-2-one) shows a good affinity for cerebral cortical 5-HT1A (pKi = 7.72) and 5-HT2A (pKi = 6.90) receptors, with no appreciable affinity for the other 5-HT receptor subtypes, including 5-HT2C. BIMT 17 reduced forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in the cerebral cortex (pEC50 = 6.09) and in the hippocampus (pEC50 = 6.50), and antagonized 5-HT-induced phosphatidylinositol turnover (pKi = 6.96) in the cerebral cortex. The effect on cAMP accumulation was blocked by the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist tertatolol. Buspirone, 8-OH-DPAT and S 14671 (1-[2-(2-thenoylamino)ethyl]- 4[1-(7-methoxynaphtyl)]-piperazine), claimed to be 5-HT1A receptor agonists, did not reduce forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation in the cerebral cortex. On the basis of these data, it was concluded that BIMT 17 was the only compound that behaved as a full agonist with respect to the cAMP response in the cortex, while exerting concurrent agonism at 5-HT1A receptors and antagonism at 5-HT2A receptors. These characteristics might explain the peculiar behavior of BIMT 17 in mimicking the inhibitory action of 5-HT on the basal firing rate of the cortical neurons (see accompanying paper).;-;-;-;hard_0

Binding to the P4 site was about 40-50-fold weaker than to the principal CRP site on the lactose promoter at both low (0.01 M) and high (0.1 M) ionic strengths. CRP-induced bending at the P4 site was investigated from the mobilities of CRP bound to circularly permuted P4 fragments. The estimated bending angle, based on comparison with Zinkel & Crothers [(1990) Biopolymers 29, 29-38] A-tract bending standards, was found to be approximately 96 degrees, similar to that found for binding to the lac site. These observations suggest that there is not a simple relationship between strength of CRP binding and the extent of induced bending for different CRP sites.

7367812;External quality control in haematological morphology: a method to assess the performance of an individual laboratory and changes in it.;A method is described to assess the performance of individual laboratories in estimating blood cell morphology by microscopy. The method was designed for the Finnish interlaboratory proficiency testing programme in haematological morphology. The method is based on the following principles: (1) on application of a detailed result form to collect the results from the participants in a standardized manner and (2) on application of a reference board to establish the morphological 'truth'. A consensus of greater than or equal to 80% of the reference board of haematology experts is the prerequisite for acceptance of a morphological detail as a 'target finding' for the participants. For each proficiency testing survey a score 'mean percentual performance' (MPP) was calculated for each participating laboratory. The MPP score indicates the percentual amount of correct identifications of the 'target findings' of the survey specimens and is an overall measure of performance of an individual laboratory. A running MPP graph was plotted to evaluate the changes in the performance over a course of time. Different types of 'performance profiles' among the participants were detected with this method. The merits of the MPP scoring method are discussed with special reference to the goals of external quality control in haematological morphology.;-;-;-;hard_0
7365463;Location of post-translational cleavage events within F and HN glycoproteins of Newcastle disease virus.;The biologically active form of the fusion glycoprotein F from Newcastle disease virus (NDV) comprises two polypeptides, F1 and F2 (derived from a precursor polypeptide F0 by a post translational cleavage event), which are covalently linked together (F1,2) by disulphide bonds. This feature was exploited in a two-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis to orientate the position of the cleavage event within F0. Separation of proteins from NDV-infected CEF in the first dimension in the absence of reducing agent resolved F1,2 protein from all NDV-induced proteins other than F0. Reduction of the first dimension gel with 2-mercaptoethanol, followed by electrophoresis in the second dimension, resolved F1 (55K), F2 (12.5K) and F0 (64K) proteins. The only polypeptides other than F1 and F2 which fell below the diagonal, indicating the positions of the polypeptides from infected cells, were two minor glycoproteins designated HN1 (51.5K) and HN2 (27.5K) which took up positions vertically beneath the major haemagglutinin-neuraminidase glycoprotein HN (75K). Dual isotope labelling experiments with NDV-infected chick embryo fibroblasts, which had previously received a salt shock to effect synchronization of polypeptide initiation upon release of salt shock, revealed the following orientations within the parent molecules: NH2-F2-F1-COOH and NH2-HN1-HN2-COOH. The existence of intermolecular disulphide bonds, orientation and relative lengths of the two NDV HN fragments is analogous to the HA1 and HA2 proteins of influenza virus haemagglutinin.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
208605;Polymyxin binding to charged lipid membranes. An example of cooperative lipid-protein interaction.;The binding of polymyxin-B to lipid bilayer vesicles of synthetic phosphatidic acid was studied using fluorescence, ESR spectroscopy and electron microscopy. 1,6-Diphenylhexatriene (which exhibits polarized fluorescence) and pyrene decanoic acid (which forms excimers) were used as fluorescence probes to study the lipid phase transition. The polymyxin binds strongly to negatively charged lipid layers. As a result of lipid/polymyxin chain-chain interactions, the transition temperature of the lipid. This can be explained in terms of a slight expansion of the crystalline lipid lattice (Lindeman's rule). Upon addition of polymyxin to phosphatidic acid vesicles two rather sharp phase transitions (width deltaT = 5 degrees C) are observed. The upper transition (at Tu) is that of the pure lipid and the lower transition (at T1) concerns the lipid bound to the peptide. The sharpness of these transitions strongly indicates that the bilayer is characterized by a heterogeneous lateral distribution of free and bound lipid regions, one in the crystalline and the other in the fluid state. Such a domain structure was directly observed by electron microscopy (freeze etching technique). In (1 : 1) mixtures of dipalmitoyl phosphatidic acid and egg lecithin, polymyxin induces the formation of domains of charged lipid within the fluid regions of egg lecithin. With both fluorescence methods the fraction of lipid bound to polymyxin-B as a function of the peptide concentration was determined. S-shaped binding curves were obtained. The same type of binding curve is obtained for the interaction of Ca2+ with phosphatidic acid lamellae, while the binding of polylysine to such membranes is characterized by a linear or Langmuir type binding curve. The S-shaped binding curve can be explained in terms of a cooperative lipid-ligand (Ca2+, polymyxin) interaction. A model is proposed which explains the association of polymyxin within the membrane plane in terms of elastic forces caused by the elastic distortion of the (liquid crystalline) lipid layer by this highly asymmetric peptide.;lysine;-;-;LCR_without_function
8105991;The regulation of autoimmunity through CD4+ T cells.;Our experiments imply that it is possible to use monoclonal antibody therapy to reestablish self tolerance to self antigens. This can be achieved by using a short course of an nd anti-CD4 antibody thus avoiding the problem of long term immunosuppression. The mechanism by which such a state of self tolerance is achieved remains to be clarified but possible mechanisms include deletion or anergy of autoreactive T cells or some form of suppression mediated through local cytokine production. As this antibody induced state of tolerance can be reversed in the NOD mouse by cyclophospamide deletion cannot be the method by which autoreactivity is prevented. The mixing experiments which have been described in the thyroiditis experiments strongly suggest that anery is not the mechanism. It therefore remains most likely that tolerance induced following administration of nd anti-CD4 is an active process maintained through the production of an inhibitory cytokine. This ability to reprogram the immune system using monoclonal antibodies makes it not beyond the realms of possibility that individuals suffering from IDDM may become tolerant of their beta cell antigens and thus be able to regenerate their own beta cell mass. If this could indeed occur it might mean that a lifetime of insulin injections and the development of the life threatening complications that may accompany a disease like IDDM may be avoided.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
9420132;Specific humoral immune responses in 12 cases of food sensitization to sesame seed.;"BACKGROUND
Hypersensitivity to sesame seeds is becoming increasingly frequent, probably owing to the larger use of this compound in international food.


OBJECTIVES
This study investigated serum responses of 12 sesame sensitized patients (seven with food allergy, five with food sensitization), to a sesame protein extract, and attempted at identifying sesame major antigens.


METHODS
Sesame protein extracts were prepared from black, white and brown sesame seeds. Electrophoretic analysis showed similar protein patterns in the three extracts, and proper preservation of the proteins integrity. The brown sesame extract was used to set-up an ELISA assay and measure serum levels of antisesame IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE in 12 samples from sesame-sensitized individuals and six controls. It also allowed to perform western blot analyses in order to investigate the molecular weight of sesame proteins recognized by IgG, IgA and IgE.


RESULTS
Nineteen protein bands were observed upon polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the sesame protein extracts. Using this whole extract in ELISA, significant antisesame IgG, IgA and IgE-responses were observed in the serum of sensitized individuals, different from the lower signals obtained with control samples. Western blot analysis demonstrated highly polymorphic IgG and IgA responses and a more restricted IgE response pattern, suggesting that two proteins, respectively, 14 kDa and 25 kDa are mostly involved in sesame IgE-dependent hypersensitivity, the 25 kDa band presenting several characteristics of a major allergen.


CONCLUSIONS
This study reports novel information on the possible involvement of a 25 kDa sesame protein in IgE-dependent hypersensitivity to sesame seeds.";-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3

Recent studies indicate that antibodies to cell wall antigens, including pneumococcal surface protein A and the phosphocholine (PC) determinant of teichoic acids as well as human C-reactive protein (which also binds to PC), can protect mice against pneumococcal infection. In the present study we compared the protective effects of these agents as measured by mouse protection, the blood bactericidal assay, and clearance of pneumococci from the blood and peritoneal cavity. Our findings extend previous results indicating that human C-reactive protein and antibodies to noncapsular antigens are generally less protective than anticapsular antibodies. The new results obtained indicate the following: (i) mouse protection studies with intraperitoneal and intravenous infections provide very similar results; (ii) monoclonal immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a) antibodies to PC, like IgG1, IgG2b, and IgG3 antibodies to PC, are highly protective against pneumococcal infection in mice; (iii) human antibody to PC is able to protect against pneumococcal infection in mice; (iv) antibodies to PspA are effective at mediating blood and peritoneal clearance of pneumococci; (v) complement is required for the in vivo protective effects of both IgG and IgM antibodies to PC; (vi) IgG1, IgG2b, and IgG3 anti-PC antibodies all mediate complement-dependent lysis of PC-conjugated erythrocytes; and (vii) antibodies and human C-reactive proteins that are reactive with capsular antigens but not cell wall antigens are able to mediate significant antibacterial activity in the blood bactericidal assay.";-;antigen;-;hard_2

They enabled determination of polymer adsorbed amount, surface and diffusion charges of solid particles with and without PAM, thickness of polymer adsorption layer, macromolecule dimensions in the solution and stability of the Cr2O3 - polymer systems, respectively. It was found that adsorption of anionic PAM decreases and thickness of polymeric adsorption layer increases with the increasing pH. Slightly higher adsorption was obtained for the PAM samples containing a greater number of carboxyl groups. At pH 3 and 9 insignificant deterioration of stability conditions of Cr2O3 particle covered with polyacrylamide was observed (neutralization of solid positive charge by the adsorbed polymeric chains (pH 3) and single polymeric bridges formation (pH 9)). The electrosteric repulsion between the solid particles covered with PAM layers at pH 6, is the main reason for significant improvement of Cr2O3 suspension stability in the polymer presence.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1

8202375;The unusual nucleotide content of the HIV RNA genome results in a biased amino acid composition of HIV proteins.;"Extremely high frequencies of the A nucleotide are found in the RNA genomes of the lentivirus group of retroviruses. It is presently unknown what molecular force is responsible for this A-pressure. In this manuscript, we demonstrate a correlation between this 'A-pressure' and the amino acid-usage of the lentivirus family. We compared the amino acid composition of the Gag and Pol proteins of the human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2) with that of the second group of human retroviruses; the human T-cell leukemia viruses type I and II (HTLV-I and HTLV-II). Differences in total amino acid content correlate with the preference for A-rich codons in the HIV genome. A pair-wise comparison of homologous amino acid positions in the Pol proteins indicates that both conservative and non-conservative changes can be accounted for by this A-bias. The putative molecular mechanism underlying this A-pressure and the evolutionary consequences are discussed.";alanine;-;-;LCR_without_function
8665262;Speciation of organotin and organolead compounds in drinking water by gas chromatography--atomic emission spectrometry.;Raw and treated water samples and distribution system water samples were collected in forty-five Canadian municipalities for the analysis of organotin and organolead compounds. After extraction from the water samples organotin and organolead compounds were alkylated with pentylmagnesium bromide and butylmagnesium chloride respectively and analysed by gas chromatography-microwave induced plasma atomic emission spectrometry (GC-AED) using wavelengths specific for tin (326.23 nm) and lead 405.78 nm). The GC-AED system was optimised for trace level analysis, especially for organolead compounds. Organotin compounds, mainly methyltin and butyltin at concentrations up to 22 ng Sn/L and 43.6 ng Sn/L respectively, were detected in distributed water samples from six municipalities. No organotin compounds were detected in raw water samples indicating that the organotin compounds were leaching into the water from some component of the distribution system. One raw water sample contained six organolead compounds at concentrations from 0.5 to 10 ng Pb/L and five raw water and three distributed water samples contained trace levels ( < 0.5 ng Pb/L) of organolead compounds. Due to the lack of authentic standards the identity of the organolead compounds could not be confirmed by gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry.;-;-;-;hard_0
2734369;A purified 124-kDa oat phytochrome does not possess a protein kinase activity.;The presence of protein kinase activity in the purified phytochrome preparations [Wong, et al. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 12089-12097] has been re-examined. The phytochrome preparations having SAR (specific absorbance ratio, A668/A280 for the Pr form as a measure of phytochrome purity) values of greater than 0.95 were homogeneous on SDS gel, but could be further purified to a SAR value of 1.07 by repeated gel filtrations on a Bio-Gel A-0.5 m column. The protein kinase activity remained in the phytochrome preparations having SAR values less than 1.05, but it became undetectable in the phytochrome preparation with a SAR value of 1.07. Two dimensional gel electrophoresis of the phytochrome preparation (SAR, 0.89) showed that a phytochrome band with pl 5.8 had no kinase activity. Phosphorylating activity of the protein kinase was enhanced to some extent by polycations, polylysine and histone. Phytochrome served as a good substrate for this enzyme. The present data indicate that phytochrome has no intrinsic protein kinase activity, but a protein kinase is present in highly purified phytochrome preparations.;lysine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
22075994;Functional and direct interaction between the RNA binding protein HuD and active Akt1.;The RNA binding protein HuD plays essential roles in neuronal development and plasticity. We have previously shown that HuD stimulates translation. Key for this enhancer function is the linker region and the poly(A) binding domain of HuD that are also critical for its function in neurite outgrowth. Here, we further explored the underlying molecular interactions and found that HuD but not the ubiquitously expressed HuR interacts directly with active Akt1. We identify that the linker region of HuD is required for this interaction. We also show by using chimeric mutants of HuD and HuR, which contain the reciprocal linker between RNA-binding domain 2 (RBD2) and RBD3, respectively, and by overexpressing a dominant negative mutant of Akt1 that the HuD-Akt1 interaction is functionally important, as it is required for the induction of neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. These results suggest the model whereby RNA-bound HuD functions as an adapter to recruit Akt1 to trigger neurite outgrowth. These data might also help to explain how HuD enhances translation of mRNAs that encode proteins involved in neuronal development. ;alanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
21077219;Polyacrylamide grafted on multi-walled carbon nanotubes for open-tubular capillary electrochromatography: comparison with silica hydride and polyacrylate phase matrices.;"A new nanoparticle-bound polymer stationary phase was prepared by in situ polymerization of methacrylamide (MAA), bis-acrylamide crosslinker, and carboxylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (multi-walled CNTs; MWNTs), using the abundant double bonds in the cyclopentadienyl rings in MWNT structure, on a silanized capillary. Each intermediate capillary between the synthesis steps was characterized by SEM, by ATR-IR, and by EOF measurements varying the pH, concentration, and volumetric ratios of ACN in running buffers. The resulting EOF profile was comparable to those of two other capillaries with different phase matrices, silica hydride and polybutyl methacrylate (BMA) phases. With the complex functionality of MWNTs on the hydrophilic polyacrylamide network, the MAA-CNT capillary was capable of separating diverse samples with a wide range of polarity and dissociation properties using open-tubular CEC. Besides optimizing CEC conditions, the migration times of samples were analyzed with respect to velocity and retention factors to evaluate electrophoretic and chromatographic contributions to the CEC mechanism. The migration rates of benzoic acids were determined by the electrophoretic mobilities of the various phenolate ions, while phenolic aldehydes and ketones were additionally influenced by chromatographic interactions, such as π-π, electrostatic effects, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions. The retention factors were greater for flavonoids, which are polyphenolic, than for simple phenols, but were smaller than those obtained from the hydrophobic BMA-CNT column. A complete well-resolved separation of the cationic forms of tetracyclines was acheived either by electrophoresis or by chromatography in the MAA-CNT capillary, but not in the BMA-CNT and silica hydride-CNT capillaries.";-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1

Assuming that no movement of the bound phenylalanyl-tRNA takes place during association of 30S subunits with 50S ribosomal subunits, the binding site of the 30S ribosomal subunit corresponds to site 2 (-NH(2) side with respect to the growing polypeptide chain) of the two binding sites of 70S ribosomes. ;phenylalanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
8735274;Mechanisms of transcriptional activation and repression can both involve TFIID.;Regulation of transcription involves the activities of activators and repressors. Recent experiments have provided evidence that the function of both types of regulators can involve interactions with one or more component of the basal transcription machinery. A principal target appears to be TFIID, which consists of the TATA binding protein (TBP) and associated factors (TAFs). Here we describe experiments that provide added support for the idea that interactions affecting TFIID can play important roles in both activation and repression. We show, using transfection assays in Drosophila Schneider cells, that recruitment of TBP to a promoter as a GAL4-TBP fusion protein can provide a substantial activation of transcription. The conserved core of TBP is necessary and sufficient for this effect, which was observed with both TATA-containing and TATA-lacking basal promoters. These findings extend experiments performed in yeast, and strengthen the idea that recruitment of TBP (TFIID) can be an important mechanism of activation. We also provide further support for the idea that TBP can be a target for a transcriptional repressor, the Drosophila Even-skipped protein (Eve). We present evidence that the homeodomain, which is necessary for binding TBP in vitro, can also be required for repression in vivo, independent of its role in DNA binding. On the other hand, deletion of the alanine/proline-rich region that is essential for repression in vivo and TBP binding in vitro does not significantly affect DNA binding by the purified protein. These results strengthen the view that TBP, either directly or indirectly as a component of TFIID, can be a target of both activators and repressors.;proline;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
7487102;Respiratory burst and tyrosine phosphorylation by vanadate.;We studied involvement of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in activation of NADPH oxidase in guinea pig neutrophils. Pervanadate, which is the oxidized form of orthovanadate, induced O2- production and protein tyrosine phosphorylation in neutrophils. O2- production induced by pervanadate was more sensitive to the tyrosine kinase-specific inhibitor, ST-638, as compared with the production induced by PMA. On the other hand, staurosporine more selectively inhibited PMA-induced O2- production than pervanadate-induced production. These results indicate that tyrosine kinase, not protein kinase C, is involved in pervanadate-induced O2- production. The tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected in both the cytosol and membrane fractions prepared from pervanadate-induced neutrophils. In order to examine if tyrosine residues of some components of NADPH oxidase were directly phosphorylated, tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were removed from solubilized membranes prepared from the pervanadate-stimulated neutrophils by immunoprecipitation with an anti-phosphotyrosine anti-body. NADPH oxidase activity in the solubilized membranes was not decreased by the treatment. These findings suggest that the components of NADPH oxidase are not tyrosine-phosphorylated by pervanadate treatment, that tyrosine phosphorylation may be involved in the signal transduction pathway of NADPH oxidase activation by pervanadate, and that this pathway is independent of the activation by protein kinase C.;-;-;-;hard_0
9142880;Insulin stimulates cell surface aminopeptidase activity toward vasopressin in adipocytes.;We previously discovered that insulin stimulates the marked translocation of a novel membrane aminopeptidase, designated vp165 for vesicle protein of 165 kDa, to the cell surface in adipocytes. To examine the hypothesis that this enzyme acts on peptide hormones, we assessed the relative affinity of the enzyme for 22 peptide hormones by measuring the inhibitory effect of each on the hydrolysis of a fluorogenic substrate, and we directly assayed the cleavage of four of these. Angiotensin III, angiotensin IV, and Lys-bradykinin bound to the enzyme with half-saturation constants between 20 and 600 nM and were cleaved by vp165. Vasopressin bound with lower affinity but at saturation was cleaved more rapidly. Subsequently, the effect of insulin on the rates of cleavage of 125I-labeled vasopressin by intact 3T3-L1 and rat adipocytes was determined. With both cell types, vasopressin cleavage was stimulated approximately threefold. These findings indicate that a physiological role for vp165 may be the processing of peptide hormones and that insulin could enhance the cleavage of extracellular substrates by eliciting the translocation of vp165 to the cell surface.;-;-;-;hard_0

656446;A specific and reversible macromolecular inhibitor of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and cinnamic acid-4-hydroxylase in gherkins.;"A non-dialysable inhibitor of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (L-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, EC 4.3.1.5) has been partially purified from dark-grown gherkin hypocotyls. On extraction of tissue it is found both in the soluble (106 000 X g supernatant) and microsomal (106 000 X g pellet) fractions and can be extracted from the microsomal membranes with 10 mM sodium cholate and 1 M KCl. The soluble and microsomal fractions have similar properties, suggesting the presence of the same active component. The inhibitor is small (Mr less than 20 000), thermolabile, sensitive to proteolytic digestion, and apparently hydrophobic. Purification of the inhibitor was achieved by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose by gel filtration on Sephadex G-50. The inhibitor preparations inhibit phenylalanine ammonia-lyase isolated from a number of plant tissues and also cinnamic acid-4-hydroxylase (trans-cinnamate, NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (4-hydroxylating), EC 1.14.13.11) from gherkins and peas, but not a wide range of other enzymes. The evidence suggests that inhibition of the two enzymes is due to the same substance, but this has not yet been confirmed. Kinetic experiments show that the inhibitor is competitive with phenylalanine for the lyase and that its association with the lyase is reversible. Further, a mixture of inhibitor and lyase can be separated on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels without loss of lyase activity. The activities of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase are often concurrently regulated and both have regulatory roles in phenol metabolism; it is suggested that the inhibitor may be specifically involved in controlling their activities in vivo.";-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
7007840;Long-term treatment of duodenal ulcer with cimetidine.

Twenty-four patients received intermittent six-week courses of cimetidine for each relapse, and 24 patients were treated with maintenance administration of cimetidine (400 mg twice a day) continuously. Only one patient in the group receiving continuous therapy suffered clinical recurrence, but asymptomatic ulceration was found in four others. The group of patients who were receiving intermittent therapy suffered a total of 36 clinical recurrences. Three of these patients required prolonged treatment to heal their ulcers, and seven developed asymptomatic ulcer. The number of relapses varied from none to five.

27514009;LPS injection reprograms the expression and the 3' UTR of a CAP gene by alternative polyadenylation and the formation of a GAIT element in Ciona intestinalis.;The diversification of cellular functions is one of the major characteristics of multicellular organisms which allow cells to modulate their gene expression, leading to the formation of transcripts and proteins with different functions and concentrations in response to different stimuli. CAP genes represent a widespread family of proteins belonging to the cysteine-rich secretory protein, antigen 5 and pathogenesis-related 1 superfamily which, it has been proposed, play key roles in the infection process and the modulation of immune responses in host animals. The ascidian Ciona intestinalis represents a group of proto-chordates with an exclusively innate immune system that has been widely studied in the field of comparative and developmental immunology. Using this biological system, we describe the identification of a novel APA mechanism by which an intronic polyadenylation signal is activated by LPS injection, leading to the formation of a shorter CAP mRNA capable of expressing the first CAP exon plus 19 amino acid residues whose sequence is contained within the first intron of the annotated gene. Furthermore, such an APA event causes the expression of a translational controlling cis-acting GAIT element which is not present in the previously isolated CAP isoform and identified in the 3'-UTR of other immune-related genes, suggesting an intriguing scenario in which both transcriptional and post-transcriptional control mechanisms are involved in the activation of the CAP gene during inflammatory response in C. intestinalis. ;cysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
3417146;Deletion of nonconserved helices near the 3' end of the rRNA intron of Tetrahymena thermophila alters self-splicing but not core catalytic activity.;The self-splicing rRNA intron of Tetrahymena thermophila contains two stem-loop structures (P9.1 and P9.2) near its 3' end that are not conserved among group I introns. As a step toward deriving the smallest active self-splicing RNA, 78 nucleotides encompassing P9.1 and P9.2 have been deleted. This deletion has no effect on the core catalytic activity of the intron, as judged by its ability to catalyze poly(C) polymerization and other related reactions. In contrast, reactions at the 3' splice site of the rRNA precursor--exon ligation and intermolecular exon ligation--take place with reduced efficiency, and exon ligation becomes rate-limiting for self-splicing. Moreover, intermolecular exon ligation with pentaribocytidylic acid is inaccurate, occurring primarily at a cryptic site in the 3' exon. A deletion of 79 nucleotides that disrupts P9, as well as removing P9.1 and P9.2, has more severe effects on both the first and second steps of splicing. P9, a conserved helix at the 5' edge of the deletion point, can form stable alternative structures in the deletion mutants. This aberrant folding may be responsible for the reduced activity and accuracy of reactions with mutant precursors. Analysis of the cryptic site suggests that choice of the 3' splice site may not only depend on sequence but also on proximity to P9. In the course of these studies, evidence has been obtained for an alternative 5' exon-binding site distinct from the normal site in the internal guide sequence. ;cysteine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
864831;The segments of influenza viral mRNA.;"Influenza viral mRNA, i.e., complementary RNA (cRNA), isolated from infected cells , was resolved into six different species by electrophoresis in 2.1% acrylamide gels containing 6 M urea. The cRNA's were grouped into three size classes: L (large), M (medium-size), and S (small). Similarly, when gels were sliced for analysis, the virion RNA (vRNA) also distributed into six peaks because the three largest vRNA segments were closely spaced and were resolved only when the gels were autoradiographed or stained. Because of their attached polyadenylic acid [poly(A)]sequences, the cRNA segments migrated more slowly than did the corresponding vRNA segments during gel electrophoresis. After removal of the poly(A) by RNase H, the cRNA and vRNA segments comigrated, indicating that they were approximately the same size. One of the cRNA segments, S2, was shown by annealing to contain the genetic information in the vRNA segment with which it comigrated, strongly suggesting that each cRNA segment was transcribed from the vRNA segment of the same size. In contrast to the vRNA segments, which when isolated from virions were present in approximately 1:1 molar ratios, the segments of the isolated cRNA were present in unequal amounts, with the segments M2 and S2 predominating, suggesting that different amounts of the cRNA segments were synthesized in the infected cell. The predominant cRNA segments, M2 and S2, and also the S1 segment, were active as mRNA's in wheat germ extracts. The M2 cRNA was the mRNA for the nucleocapsid protein; S1 for the membrane protein; and S2 for the nonstructural protein NS1.";alanine;-;-;LCR_without_function
2903157;The transforming growth factor-beta receptor type III is a membrane proteoglycan. Domain structure of the receptor.;The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor type III is a low abundance cell surface component that binds TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 with high affinity and specificity, and is present in many mammalian and avian cell types. Type III TGF-beta receptors affinity-labeled with 125I-TGF-beta migrate in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels as diffuse species of 250-350 kDa. Here we show that type III receptors deglycosylated by the action of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid yield affinity-labeled receptor cores of 110-130 kDa. This marked decrease in molecular weight is also achieved by combined treatment of type III receptors with heparitinase and chondroitinase ABC. Digestion of receptor-linked glycosaminoglycans by treatment of intact cell monolayers with heparitinase and chondroitinase does not prevent TGF-beta binding to the type III receptor core polypeptide and does not release the receptor polypeptide from the membrane. The type III TGF-beta receptor binds tightly to DEAE-Sephacel and coelutes with cellular proteoglycans at a characteristically high salt concentration. Thus, the type III TGF-beta receptor has the properties of a membrane proteoglycan that carries heparan and chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains. The binding site for TGF-beta appears to reside in the 100-120-kDa core polypeptide of this receptor. The type III receptor is highly sensitive to cleavage by trypsin. Trypsin action releases the glycosaminoglycan-containing domain of the receptor leaving a 60-kDa membrane-associated domain that contains the cross-linked ligand. A model for the domain structure of the TGF-beta receptor type III is proposed based on these results.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antinociceptive effect of DKK13 on trigeminal neuralgia (TN) in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were treated with the chronic constriction injury of the infraorbital nerve (IoN-CCI) model to induce stable symptoms of TN. DKK13 (1.0 mg/kg, 2.0 mg/kg and 4.0 mg/kg, i.v.) or morphine (4.0 mg/kg, i.v.) was administered by tail vein once on day 14 after IoN-CCI injury. Behavioral tests, electrophysiology and western blotting were performed to investigate the role and underlying mechanisms of DKK13 on IoN-CCI model. Behavioral test results showed that DKK13 could significantly increase the mechanical pain and thermal radiation pain thresholds of IoN-CCI rats and inhibit the asymmetric spontaneous pain scratching behavior. Electrophysiological results showed that DKK13 could significantly reduce the current density of Nav1.8 in the ipsilateral side of trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons in IoN-CCI rats, and the steady-state activation and inactivation curves of Nav1.8 shifted, respectively, to the direction of hyperpolarization and depolarization. Western blotting results showed that DKK13 significantly reduced the expression of Nav1.8 and the phosphorylation levels of key proteins of MAPKs/CREB pathway in TG tissues of IoN-CCI rats. In brief, DKK13 has a significant antinociceptive effect on IoN-CCI rats, which may be achieved by changing the dynamic characteristics of Nav1.8 channel and regulating the protein phosphorylation in MAPKs/CREB pathway.;-;-;-;hard_0

We report 6 patients with the clinical association of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and hyperthyroidism.

No control had anti-Mic-1 antibody. In addition, this antibody was shown to be organ specific.

The technique being used, known as Immuno-Gold-Silver staining (IGSS), is applied to serum dots on cellulose nitrate. It is very simple in practice, the results of the reaction being visible with the naked eye. The diagnostic value of IGSS has been compared, on the one hand, with that of the anti-Candida antibody detection by co-counterimmunoelectrophoresis and indirect immunofluorescence, on the other hand with that of the antigen detection using the Cand-Tec commercial test. The specificity and sensitivity of these methods have been established in relation to sera of 79 subjects shared out into 4 groups: sound-subjects, patients having developed systemic candidiasis following surgery, leukemic patients apparently uninfected with Candida and leukemic patients suffering from systemic candidiasis. The IGSS which is slightly less specific than the Cand Tec makes it possible to diagnose a much greater number of infections.

8106082;HAT3.1, a novel Arabidopsis homeodomain protein containing a conserved cysteine-rich region.;Homeodomain proteins have been shown to play a major role in the development of various organisms. A novel Arabidopsis homeodomain protein has been isolated based on its capability to interact with a DNA motif derived from the light-induced cab-E promoter of Nicotiana plumbaginifolia. The homeodomain of this protein, designated HAT3.1, differs substantially from those in other plant homeobox proteins identified so far. Furthermore, HAT3.1 is unique among other Arabidopsis proteins in that it does not contain a leucine zipper motif following the homeodomain. HAT3.1 is further characterized by an N-terminal region that shares substantial sequence similarity with the maize homeodomain protein Zmhox1a. Within this conserved region, the presence of eight regularly spaced cysteine/histidine residues was observed reminiscent of other metal-binding domains. Based on the strong evolutionary conservation of this domain, it is proposed that this region represents a novel protein-motif which is denoted PHD-finger (plant homeodomain-finger). In vitro DNA binding studies demonstrated that HAT3.1 is capable of interacting with any DNA fragment larger than 100 bp. Interestingly, a deletion of the N-terminal PHD-finger domain completely abolished DNA binding, suggesting that this region may play an important functional role in protein-protein or protein-DNA interaction. HAT3.1 mRNA was primarily detected in root tissue, implying a regulatory function of this protein in root development. ;cysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

The small-size proteoglycans (Kav 0.4, on Sepharose CL-4B) from both normal and atherosclerotic tissue contained primarily a dermatan sulfate proteoglycan with an intact molecular size of 220-330 kd and a 45-kd core protein. In addition to the dermatan sulfate proteoglycan, the preparation contained a proteoglycan recognized by monoclonal antibody (MAb) 5-D-4, indicating the presence of sulfated poly-N-acetyllactosamine sequences common to corneal and cartilage keratan sulfate. Electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel revealed a polydisperse proteoglycan of 60-150 kd that was recognized by MAb 5-D-4. Significantly greater immunoreactivity with MAb 5-D-4 was observed for atherosclerotic compared with normal artery. After endo-beta-D-galactosidase treatment of the proteoglycan from atherosclerotic aorta, diminished MAb 5-D-4 reactivity observed by both Western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated that the material was keratan sulfate. Endo-beta-D-galactosidase treatment of the intact proteoglycan generated core proteins of 28 and 38 kd.

Each was a distinct polypeptide, as shown by the distinct peptide patterns resulting from limited proteolysis in the presence of detergents. The three polypeptides were synthesized by primary cultures of hepatocytes and were externally oriented at the surface of these cells, as shown by their accessibility in situ to iodination catalyzed by lactoperoxidase. They were not detectable in the serum by crossed immunoelectrophoresis. The three antigens were present at very low (PM110) or nondetectable (PM105, PM160) concentrations in intracellular membrane fractions derived from the Golgi and smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum of liver. The antigens also were reduced in concentration in a plasma membrane fraction most likely derived from the sinusoidal surface of the hepatocyte. The three membrane antigens bind to concanavalin A; hence, they are probably glycoprotein constituents of a discrete domain of the hepatocyte plasma membrane. Immune complexes were isolated after crossed immunoelectrophoresis and injected into rabbits. Each of the antisera obtained was reactive to one of the membrane polypeptides. Sections of fixed rat livers were reacted with each of the antibodies and then the primary antibody was localized by indirect immunocytochemical methods using horseradish peroxidase or colloidal gold as labels. Each of the three antigens was localized by this method to the bile canalicular domain of the hepatocyte plasma membrane.";-;antigen;-;hard_2
8593669;Localization of the CD15-epitope in the inner ear of the developing mouse.;The expression of the 3-fucosyl-N-acetyl-lactosamine (CD15) epitope during the embryonic development of the mouse inner ear has been immunohistochemically studied on paraffin sections from day 8.5 to day 19 of gestation. Consecutive steps of morphological development are accompanied by up- and down-regulation of CD15 expression and changing cell patterns. Expression levels are reduced once structural maturation has been accomplished. Since CD15 has been described as a determinant that is expressed during critical developmental steps, it is speculated that the changes in the epitope expression in the inner ear reflect relevant stages of differentiation. This system may thus serve as a model for understanding inner ear development.;-;-;-;hard_0
8740164;Immobilized metal ion affinity gel electrophoresis: quantification of protein affinity to transition metal chelates.;This paper describes some recent advances in the methodology of immobilized metal ion affinity gel electrophoresis. Four different ways to incorporate metal chelate ligands in agarose and polyacrylamide-based electrophoresis gels are evaluated, a new polymerizable metal chelating ligand, allyl-2-hydroxy-3-(N,N-dicarboxymethyl)amino-propyl ether, is introduced, and the determination of affinity constants described. The affinities of model proteins (ribonucleases A and B and cytochromes c from different species) for the transition metal chelate iminodiacetic acid-Cu(II) were studied. The results were found to be in agreement with literature data on immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography, and the polymer nature and the different chemistries used influenced the affinity only quantitatively, keeping the basic mechanisms of interaction unchanged.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
20441177;Comparative characterization of short monomeric polyglutamine peptides by replica exchange molecular dynamics simulation.;Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are caused by an abnormal expansion of CAG repeats. While their detailed structure remains unclear, polyQ peptides assume beta-sheet structures when they aggregate. To investigate the conformational ensemble of short, monomeric polyQ peptides, which consist of 15 glutamine residues (Q(15)), we performed replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations. We found that Q(15) can assume multiple configurations due to all of the residues affecting the formation of side-chain hydrogen bonds. Analysis of the free energy landscape reveals that Q(15) has a basin for random-coil structures and another for alpha-helix or beta-turn structures. To investigate properties of aggregated polyQ peptides, we performed multiple molecular dynamics (MMD) simulations for monomeric and oligomeric Q(15). MMD revealed that the formation of oligomers stabilizes the beta-turn structure by increasing the number of hydrogen bonds between the main chains. ;glutamine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
3022463;Expression of the malignant phenotype in rat fibroblasts transfected with the polyomavirus transforming genes.;As a step toward understanding the molecular mechanism of cooperation between viral and cellular genes in oncogenic transformation, we examined various properties of rat cells transfected with the polyomavirus transforming genes without selecting for a neoplastic phenotype. The cell lines displayed a phenotype ranging from nontumorigenic (flat) to fully transformed (tumorigenic). In the established FR3T3 cell line, acquisition of the fully transformed phenotype correlated with effective expression of the polyomavirus middle T (pmt) antigen. Flat cells carrying silent copies of pmt mutated spontaneously to the fully transformed state with a frequency of 2 to 6 X 10(-5) per cell per generation. In unestablished rat fibroblasts, simultaneous transfer of either pmt and small T or pmt and large T in the presence of the neo marker conferred only a partially transformed phenotype to most of the cell lines. The same results were obtained when wild-type genomic DNA was cotransfected with pSV2-neo. The flat transformants progressively acquired properties characteristic of fully transformed cells with passage in culture. However, in contrast to FR3T3 cells, the generation of fully transformed variants from the flat, unestablished fibroblasts was not caused by activation of pmt expression. This indicates that the functions conferred by the large and small T antigens, alone or in combination with each other, cannot substitute for all the functions expressed by the FR3T3 cell line as a result of in vitro establishment. Thus, polyomavirus-mediated transformation may require additional cellular alterations beyond the acquisition of the three viral oncogenes.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
6296819;Changes in the topography of early region transcription during polyoma virus lytic infection.;We have studied the pattern of transcription of the early region of polyoma virus DNA after the onset of the late phase of lytic infection of mouse cells. Following initiation of viral DNA synthesis, the early/late switch is accompanied not only by efficient production of late mRNAs but also by the appearance of previously unidentified early-strand RNAs which have certain structural features in common with the classical early mRNAs. Stable poly(A)+RNAs have been identified by blot analysis and S1 nuclease mapping that are not detected early during infection or in polyoma virus-transformed cells. One group consists of transcripts whose 5' ends map 150-200 nucleotides upstream from the major early 5' ends (at positions 148 and 153 on the polyoma virus genome) but whose splicing pattern and poly(A) addition sites are indistinguishable from those of mRNAs produced early in infection. The 5' exons of these early region transcripts contain an open translational reading frame that extends from nucleotide positions 5,255 to 124 and is capable of encoding a basic protein of 53 amino acids. Transcription of these RNAs does not appear to be negatively regulated by large tumor antigen. A transcript of 1,800 nucleotides appears to map predominantly between 93 and 26 map units and does not contain sequences present in the early mRNA 5' exons. These data suggest that, after the onset of polyoma DNA replication, the activation of new early-strand promoters leads to the expression of previously untranscribed viral DNA sequences.;alanine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

Gene 6 exonuclease specified by a T7 strain with a temperature sensitive mutation in gene 6 has an extremely heat-labile RNase H activity as well as a heat-labile DNase activity. T7 gene 6 exonuclease degrades the RNA region of a poly(A) . poly(dT) hybrid polymer exonucleolytically from the 5' terminus, releasing a ribonucleoside 5'-monophosphate product. When the RNA strand of a 0X174 RNA . DNA hybrid molecule synthesized with E. coli RNA polymerase is degraded, a ribonucleoside triphosphate is produced from the 5'-triphosphate terminus.

7766820;Synthesis and characterization of polyamides containing unnatural amino acids.;We describe the synthesis of several polyamides that retain the secondary structure of proteins and contain derivatizable side chains. The derivatizable side chain allows for further reaction of the polymer chain (e.g., chain cross-linking or addition of pendant groups). Polymers of alpha-amino acids containing a terminal unsaturated bond on the side chain have been synthesized. Poly-L-pentenyl glycine, poly-L-propargyl glycine, and poly-L-allyl glycine were synthesized chemically via Leuchs' anhydrides and enzymatically using subtilisin Carlsberg. Poly-L-propargyl glycine and poly-D,L-allyl glycine folded into the beta-sheet configuration whereas poly-L-pentenyl glycine assumed a helical conformation. The secondary structure of poly-L-allyl glycine and poly-D,L-pentenylglycine could not be determined conclusively.

6422368;Autoimmune phenomena in infertile patients with endometriosis.;To assess the presence of autoimmune factors in patients with endometriosis, endometrial homogenates, peritoneal fluid, and serum were evaluated in 23 patients with endometriosis and 22 control subjects. The methods used were Ouchterlony immunodiffusion, immunoelectrophoresis, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and radial immunodiffusion. The study demonstrated precipitation lines between endometrial homogenates and serum from some endometriosis patients but not from the control subjects. Immunoelectrophoresis demonstrated precipitation lines at beta-globulin position when endometrial homogenates were used against serum of patients with endometriosis and with goat antihuman serum. It is suggested that an antigen, possibly a glycoprotein, is present in the endometrial homogenates. Radial immunodiffusion studies for immunoglobulins (Ig) G, A, and M and complement components C3c and C4 showed significantly higher concentrations of C3c and C4 in serum and peritoneal fluid of patients with endometriosis than the control subjects (P less than .05).

9151841;Human T cells recovered from human/Balb radiation chimeras are hypersensitive to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection.;Replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is regulated by virus-encoded regulatory proteins, as well as by a variety of cellular factors. Productive infection of human T lymphocytes by HIV-1 is dependent upon the activation status of the target cells. In general, short-term mitogenic stimulation of CD4 T cells is used to enhance infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in vitro. Recently, we demonstrated that adoptive transfer of human PBMC into lethally irradiated BALB/c mice, radioprotected with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse bone marrow, leads to marked T-cell activation and proliferation. In the present study, we investigated the effect of such xenoactivation of human T cells on their susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. Human cells that were recovered from human/Balb radiation chimeras supported efficient replication of laboratory strains of HIV-1, as well as of HIV-1 clinical isolates. The multiplicity of infection required to attain effective virus replication in the recovered xenoactivated human cells was 10- to 100-fold lower than that needed for infection of short- or long-term phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated blasts or of various T-cell lines. Analysis of human cell surface activation markers has indicated that xenoactivation in the mouse, in contrast to in vitro stimulation with PHA, is associated with a marked downregulation of CD25 (interleukin 2 receptor). Our results demonstrate that human cells recovered from human/Balb radiation chimeras, which are hypersensitive to HIV-1 infection, differ from in vitro-stimulated cells in their activation status. Therefore, this system could be used to study host factors that participate in HIV-1 infection and replication in vitro and in vivo.;-;-;-;hard_0

After treatment with antibiotics (all three patients), corticosteroids (one patient), a mydriatic-cycloplegic solution (two patients), and antiglaucoma drugs (one patient), the shallowing and uveal effusion resolved.

SMP 6.1 was purified from the culture supernatant by ammonium sulfate precipitation, acetone fractional precipitation, and preparative isoelectric focusing. SMP 6.1 has a molecular mass of approximately 50,900 Da by sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The following substrates were hydrolyzed: casein, bovine serum albumin, and hide powder. SMP 6.1 has the characteristics of a metalloprotease, a pH optimum of 10.0, and a temperature optimum of 42 degrees C. The isoelectric point of the protease is 6.1. Restoration of proteolytic activity by in-gel renaturation after SDS-PAGE indicates a single polypeptide chain. SMP 6.1 is inhibited by EDTA (9 micrograms/ml) and not inhibited by antipain dihydrochloride (120 micrograms/ml), aprotinin (4 micrograms/ml), bestatin (80 micrograms/ml), chymostatin (50 micrograms/ml), E-64 (20 micrograms/ml), leupeptin (4 micrograms/ml), Pefabloc SC (2000 micrograms/ml), pepstatin (4 micrograms/ml), phosphoramidon (660 micrograms/ml), or phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (400 micrograms/ml).

1127870;Effects on platelet function of removal of platelet sialic acid by neuraminidase.;"A number of investigators have implicated sialic acid on the surface of platelets in platelet function. In this study we have quantitated the amount of sialic acid removed by purified neuraminidase from the surface of washed platelets of man, rabbit, or pig and examined the effects of this removal. Purified neuraminidase did not induce the release of platelet granule contents. Platelets were pre-labeled with 14C-serotonin for measurement of the release reaction or with 51Cr for determination of adherence to a collagen-coated surface or damaged aortic surface, and for in vivo platelet survival studies. Washed, neuraminidase-treated platelets were resuspended in Tyrode's solution containing 0.35 per cent albumin or in citrated platelet-free plasma from the same species. Both resuspending fluids contained apyrase. Aggregating agents tested were ADP, acid-soluble collagen, thrombin, ristocetin (with human platelets), polylysine, and serotonin (with rabbit platelets). With all of these agents except polylysine, aggregation of neuraminidase-treated human or rabbit platelets was slightly enhanced compared with control platelets; aggregation of pig platelets was unchanged. When release-inducing agents were used, neuraminidase-treated platelets released more of their 14C-serotonin than control platelets. The extent to which rabbit platelets adhered to a collagen-coated surface or to the damaged surface of everted rabbit aorta was unchanged by pretreatment of platelets with neuraminidase. Therefore it seems unlikely that sialic acid is involved in platelet adherence to collagen. When more than 15 per cent of total sialic acid had been removed from rabbit platelets, they were completely cleared from the circulation within 1 hour of their injection into rabbits. When 8 to 10 per cent of total sialic acid had been removed, the platelets were not cleared immediately from the circulation but were cleared more quickly than control platelets. Thus, although removal of up to 65 per cent of platelet sialic acid has only a slightly enhancing effect on platelet aggregation and release in vitro, removal of as little as 8 to 10 per cent results in the recognition of platelets as ""foreign"" in vivo.";lysine;-;-;LCR_without_function

9692012;In vitro fertilization for male infertility: when and how?;"The first observation that in vitro fertilization (IVF) was useful for treating oligozoospermia and oligoasthenozoospermia was reported by Fishel and Edwards in 1982. This was followed by a series of cases indicating the value of IVF in such cases. Conventional IVF has been modified and refined to achieve increased rates of conception in cases of male factor infertility. Methods such as high insemination concentration IVF for the treatment of teratozoospermia and microscopic IVF for the treatment of oligozoospermia have had some impact on fertilization and pregnancy rates; however, reports of success are varied. The recent advent of micromanipulation and, in particular, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) has overshadowed the use of these modified IVF procedures. Because of the high fertilization and pregnancy rates achieved with ICSI, other micromanipulation techniques (subzonal insemination and partial zona dissection) have been abandoned; there have also been suggestions that other more conventional techniques, i.e. IVF, should also be abandoned and that ICSI become the sole technique for the treatment of infertility. The rapid increase in the number of centres using ICSI has led to extreme pressure for individual units to achieve high fertilization and pregnancy rates and there is a temptation to assign all patients to ICSI treatment. It is important that, in this highly competitive environment, new techniques are not applied haphazardly and reduced to the mere injection of gametes and achievement of pregnancy regardless of the cause of infertility. In his 1986 IVF--Historical Perspective, Fishel quoted Auguste Comte: 'to understand science it is necessary to know its history'. IVF has much recent history in animal and also human work. Although ICSI is the most significant therapeutic advance in male infertility treatment, its application to human IVF is only 4 years old, with a paucity of animal studies on which to rely. For this reason IVF still plays a very important role in the treatment of male factor infertility and should only be ruled out when it has failed previously or the number of available sperm is limited.";-;-;-;hard_0
25136112;Automodification switches PARP-1 function from chromatin architectural protein to histone chaperone.;Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1) is a highly abundant chromatin-associated enzyme. It catalyzes the NAD(+)-dependent polymerization of long chains of poly-ADP ribose (PAR) onto itself in response to DNA damage and other cues. More recently, the enzymatic activity of PARP-1 has also been implicated in the regulation of gene expression. The molecular basis for the functional switch from chromatin architectural protein to transcription factor and DNA damage responder, triggered by PARP-1 automodification, is unknown. Here, we show that unmodified PARP-1 engages in at least two high-affinity binding modes with chromatin, one of which does not involve free DNA ends, consistent with its role as a chromatin architectural protein. Automodification reduces PARP-1 affinity for intact chromatin but not for nucleosomes with exposed DNA ends. Automodified (AM) PARP-1 has the ability to sequester histones (both in vitro and in cells) and to assemble nucleosomes efficiently in vitro. This unanticipated nucleosome assembly activity of AM-PARP-1, coupled with the fast turnover of the modification, suggests a model in which DNA damage or transcription events trigger transient histone chaperone activity.  ;-;transcription factor;-;hard_2
27234298;SCF (Fbxl17) ubiquitylation of Sufu regulates Hedgehog signaling and medulloblastoma development.;Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligases direct cell survival decisions by controlling protein ubiquitylation and degradation. Sufu (Suppressor of fused) is a central regulator of Hh (Hedgehog) signaling and acts as a tumor suppressor by maintaining the Gli (Glioma-associated oncogene homolog) transcription factors inactive. Although Sufu has a pivotal role in Hh signaling, the players involved in controlling Sufu levels and their role in tumor growth are unknown. Here, we show that Fbxl17 (F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 17) targets Sufu for proteolysis in the nucleus. The ubiquitylation of Sufu, mediated by Fbxl17, allows the release of Gli1 from Sufu for proper Hh signal transduction. Depletion of Fbxl17 leads to defective Hh signaling associated with an impaired cancer cell proliferation and medulloblastoma tumor growth. Furthermore, we identify a mutation in Sufu, occurring in medulloblastoma of patients with Gorlin syndrome, which increases Sufu turnover through Fbxl17-mediated polyubiquitylation and leads to a sustained Hh signaling activation. In summary, our findings reveal Fbxl17 as a novel regulator of Hh pathway and highlight the perturbation of the Fbxl17-Sufu axis in the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma. ;leucine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

Nevertheless, intermediate- and late-stage viral gene expression and formation of ultrastructurally mature, membrane-enveloped virions occurred under the nonpermissive conditions. The RAP94-deficient particles contained the viral genome, structural proteins, early transcription factor, and certain enzymes but, unlike normal virions, had low or undetectable amounts of the viral RNA polymerase, capping enzyme/termination factor, poly(A) polymerase, DNA-dependent ATPase, RNA helicase, and topoisomerase.

These findings suggest that these DNA-binding sperm proteins function as potent activators for CK-II in fertilized eggs.

16803875;Wheat eukaryotic initiation factor 4B organizes assembly of RNA and eIFiso4G, eIF4A, and poly(A)-binding protein.;The eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4B promotes the RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity and ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity of eIF4A and eIF4F during translation initiation. Although this function is conserved among plants, animals, and yeast, eIF4B is one of the least conserved of initiation factors at the sequence level. To gain insight into its functional conservation, the organization of the functional domains of eIF4B from wheat has been investigated. Plant eIF4B contains three RNA binding domains, one more than reported for mammalian or yeast eIF4B, and each domain exhibits a preference for purine-rich RNA. In addition to a conserved RNA recognition motif and a C-terminal RNA binding domain, wheat eIF4B contains a novel N-terminal RNA binding domain that requires a short, lysine-rich containing sequence. Both the lysine-rich motif and an adjacent, C-proximal motif are conserved with an N-proximal sequence in human and yeast eIF4B. The C-proximal motif within the N-terminal RNA binding domain in wheat eIF4B is required for interaction with eIFiso4G, an interaction not reported for other eIF4B proteins. Moreover, each RNA binding domain requires dimerization for binding activity. Two binding sites for the poly(A)-binding protein were mapped to a region within each of two conserved 41-amino acid repeat domains on either side of the C-terminal RNA binding domain. eIF4A bound to an adjacent region within each repeat, supporting a central role for these conserved eIF4B domains in facilitating interaction with other components of the translational machinery. These results support the notion that eIF4B functions by organizing multiple components of the translation initiation machinery and RNA. ;lysine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Addition of Ca2+ up to 5.0 microM to the enzyme reaction mixture caused a significant decrease of dUTPase activity, while Zn2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Al3+, Mn2+ and Ni2+ (10 microM) did not have an appreciable effect. The Ca(2+)-induced decrease of dUTPase activity was reversed by the presence of regucalcin; the effect was complete at 1.0 microM of the protein. Regucalcin had no effect on the basal activity of the enzyme. Meanwhile, the reversible effect of regucalcin on the Ca2+ (10 microM)-induced decrease of dUTPase activity was not altered by the coexistence of Cd2+ or Zn2+ (10 microM). The present data suggest that liver cytosolic dUTPase is uniquely regulated by Ca2+ of various metals, and that the Ca2+ effect is reversed by regucalcin.";-;phosphatase activity;-;hard_2

8892755;Expression, characterization, and genomic structure of carp JAK1 kinase gene.;A 3.7-kb cDNA encodes the carp JAK1 kinase of 1,156 amino acid residues. The overall amino acid sequence identity between carp JAK1 and murine JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and human TYK2 is 57%, 35.5%, 31.3%, and 42.4%, respectively. In addition, carp JAK1 shows higher sequence homology to mammalian JAK1 in both the kinase-like (JH2) and kinase (JH1) domains (approximately 70% identity). Therefore, carp JAK1 is a homolog of mammalian JAK1. To investigate the possible function of JH2 domain, full-length, and various truncated forms of carp JAK1 were produced in the baculovirus system. Our results demonstrate that c-JH1 and c-JH2 associate with each other and c-JH2 can be tyrosine-phosphorylated by c-JAK1 and by c-JH(1 + 2). The JAK1 gene was also isolated from a carp genomic library and characterized. This gene is divided into 24 exons spanning at least 31 kb of genomic DNA. Exon 1 contains the 5'-untranslated region and exon 2 contains the putative translation initiation site. The 2.5-kb DNA region upstream of the transcription initiation site contains numerous potential binding sites for transcription factors including NF-IL6, HNF-5, AP1, GHF-5, and E2A. When this DNA fragment was placed upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene and transfected into a carp CF cell line, it could drive the synthesis of CAT enzyme 16 times more efficiently than the promoterless pCAT-Basic. Deletion analysis defined a positive regulatory region between -1,023 and -528. A smaller region (-181 to +59) without any typical TATA-box sequences, G + C-rich sequences, or other binding sequences for known transcription factors still had promoter activity. Constructs without this region did not have detectable promoter activity. This suggests that this region of DNA may play an important role in the expression of carp JAK1 gene.;cysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

This cDNA partially complements the methyl methane sulfonate (MMS) sensitive phenotype of BW535. It also partially corrects the UV-sensitive phenotype of E. coli AB1886 (uvrA) and restores its ability to reactivate UV-irradiated lambda phage. It has an insert of ca. 1.3 kb with an open reading frame of 1047 bp (predicting a protein with a molecular mass of 36 kDa). This cDNA presents a high homology to a stress related gene from two species of Fusarium (sti35) and to genes whose products participate in the thiamine biosynthesis pathway, THI4, from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and nmt2 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The Arabidopsis predicted polypeptide has homology to several protein motifs: amino-terminal chloroplast transit peptide, dinucleotide binding site, DNA binding and bacterial DNA polymerases. The auxotrophy for thiamine in the yeast thi4::URA3 disruption strain is complemented by the Arabidopsis gene.

In the absence of ATP, cross-linking of G-actin-S1 complexes by 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC) yielded a major 165-170-kDa and a fainter 200-205-kDa doublet polypeptide. The actin:S1 molar ratio was 1 in the EDC-cross-linked complexes, using either double labeling techniques or the method combining EDC + N-hydroxysuccinimide. Chemical cleavages of the covalently cross-linked complexes by formic acid and N-hydroxylamine (Sutoh, K. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 1579-1585) showed that in the main cross-linked 165-kDa polypeptide, the 1-12 acidic N-terminal region of actin was covalently linked to the lysine-rich region connecting the central 50-kDa domain to the C-terminal 20-kDa domain of S1, as in F-acto-S1 complexes. G-actin, but not F-actin, was covalently cross-linked to S1 by N,N'-paraphenylenedimaleimide (p-PDM). A major 195-kDa and a minor 165-kDa polypeptide were obtained, could be separated from actin and S1 by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and did not exhibit actin-activated Mg-ATPase activity. Both EDC-cross-linked and p-PDM-cross-linked complexes between G-actin and S1 could be incorporated into F-acto-S1 decorated filaments. The C-terminal cysteine 374 of actin is involved in the p-PDM cross-linked 195-kDa complex. Accordingly, a covalent photocross-linked 200-kDa conjugate was formed between S1 heavy chain and benzophenone-G-actin, obtained by covalent modification of Cys374 by benzophenonemaleimide (Tao, T., Lamkin, M., and Scheiner, C. J. (1985) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 240, 627-634). These results demonstrate that (i) G-actin-S1 and F-actin-S1 complexes display a large similarity in the EDC-cross-linked electrostatic close contacts and (ii) a change in the environment of Cys374 is linked to the polymerization into F-actin-S1 decorated filaments.;lysine;-;-;LCR_without_function
6538501;Comparison of antitumor effects of daunorubicin covalently linked to poly-L-amino acid carriers.;Daunorubicin was covalently linked to poly-L-aspartic and poly-L-lysine of different molecular weights via the methylketone side-chain of the drug by the use of a method that employs the 14-bromo derivative of the antibiotic. During reaction ester and C-N linkages were formed with poly-L-aspartic acid and poly-L-lysine respectively. Whereas a reduction of drug toxicity was observed with both types of conjugate, only the linking to the anionic polymer produced an enhancement of drug activity. In contrast, when drug was covalently attached to poly-L-lysine, cytotoxic activity and in vivo potency and efficacy were markedly reduced. The different therapeutic properties of these conjugates can be explained in terms of the different nature and stability of chemical bonds formed between the drug and the amino groups and carboxyl functions of the polyamino acid carrier.;-;-;poly-L-;hard_1
1774311;Diagnostic potential of baculovirus-expressed rubella virus envelope proteins.;The envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 of rubella virus were abundantly expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 insect cells by using a baculovirus expression vector. The recombinant protein products were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography and characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting, and enzyme immunoassay (EIA). The purified recombinant antigen consisted of the envelope polypeptides, corresponding to the viral E1 and E2 proteins, and a polyprotein precursor (molecular mass, 90 to 95 kDa). The antigen was reactive with human convalescent-phase sera in immunoblot analysis, and the reactivity correlated well (r = 0.861) with that of a whole-virus antigen when tested by EIA by using a total of 106 rubella virus immunoglobulin G-positive and -negative serum specimens. When the sera from patients with recent rubella virus infection were tested with the recombinant glycoproteins by EIA, the correlation was not as close (r = 0.690). However, all of the 26 serum specimens were reactive with the recombinant antigen. The results demonstrate that these bioengineered antigens have a potential for use in routine diagnostic assays of rubella virus immunity and recent infection.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
1618852;Purification of nuclear proteins that bind to cisplatin-damaged DNA. Identity with high mobility group proteins 1 and 2.;The biochemical processes responsible for the recognition and repair of cisplatin-damaged DNA in human cells are not well understood. We have developed a damaged DNA affinity precipitation technique that allows the direct visualization and characterization of cellular proteins that bind to cisplatin-damaged DNA. The method separates damaged DNA-binding proteins from complex radiolabeled cell mixtures and further resolves them into individual polypeptides by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This technique is complementary to gel retardation and Southwestern blotting analyses that have been previously used to identify cellular components that specifically bind to cisplatin-damaged DNA. Using this technique, we have characterized a set of HeLaS3 nuclear proteins of 26.5, 28, 90, and 97 kDa that specifically bind to cisplatin-DNA adducts. Competition studies with soluble cisplatin-damaged DNA confirmed these findings. The major cisplatin-damaged DNA-binding proteins of 26.5 and 28 kDa recognized adducts of DNA modified with cisplatin but not with its trans-isomer or with UV radiation. These proteins were purified 450-fold to near homogeneity by ion-exchange and cisplatin-damaged DNA affinity chromatography. Amino-terminal sequence analysis showed that the 26.5- and 28-kDa proteins were identical to high mobility group (HMG) proteins HMG-2 and HMG-1, respectively.;-;nucleic acid binding;polyacrylamide;hard_3
6894553;Cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent regulation of purified bovine aortic calcium/calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase.;Myosin light chain kinase was extracted from bovine aortic muscularis by a low ionic strength buffer containing 50% glycerol. It was purified 130-fold with a 10% yield by anion-exchange chromatography followed by affinity chromatography on calmodulin-Sepharose. The enzyme was 95% calcium/calmodulin-dependent and exhibited a specific activity of 2-6 mumol/min per mg. It phosphorylated the myosin regulatory light chain exclusively. The apparent Kd for calmodulin was 6.3 nM. Upon phosphorylation of the enzyme by the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, its affinity for calmodulin decreased 4-fold, without alteration of the V. When examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the purified enzyme was made up of two major peptides (Mr 142 000 and 131 000, respectively), with a minor 80 000 dalton peptide. All these peptides were 32P-labeled after incubation with [gamma-32P]ATP and the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Also, after non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, they all exhibited myosin light chain kinase activity, suggesting that the 131 000 and 80 000 dalton species are proteolytic products of the native enzyme of Mr 142 000. Vascular smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase is therefore soluble, calcium/calmodulin dependent and phosphorylatable by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase with concomitant decrease in its affinity for calmodulin. These features account for the beta-adrenergic relaxation of vascular smooth muscle.;-;kinase activity;polyacrylamide;hard_3
566558;Dispersion of mammalian sperm chromatin during fertilization: an in vitro study.;"When ""denuded spermatozoa"" (spermatozoa stripped of the greater part of their acrosomes and resembling in may respects spermatozoa after acrosomal reaction) of the bull are incubated with 0.1 M 2-mercaptoethanol (pH 8), sperm chromatin is degraded extensively by a protease in the sperm head. The morphological pattern of sperm nuclear dispersion upon in vitro incubation is similar to that observed in the newly fertilized egg. Following disintegration of the outer layers of the sperm nucleus, chromatin dispersion commences from the periphery of the posterior half and proceeds to the anterior end and to the core of the head. Less basic N- and C-terminal portions of bull sperm histone molecules are digested quickly. The central, very arginine-rich portions of the molecules degrade gradually, yielding an heterogeneous series of arginine-rich peptides (molecular weight, 400-1500). Evidence suggests that the protease which is responsible for the degradation of sperm chromatin is a small fraction of acrosin. This fraction of acrosin appears to be arranged along the nuclear surface and to become associated with sperm chromatin during structural changes of the nuclear surface. A similar proteolysis of rabbit, hamster and guinea pig sperm chromatin has also been observed. The resulting pattern of dissolution of the sperm nucleus is proposed as a model of some of the steps involved in male pronucleus formation from the sperm head after fertilization. Histones H2a, H2b, H3, and H4 associated with DNA are relatively resistant to acrosin.";arginine;-;-;LCR_without_function
11842174;Purification and identification of a 42-kilodalton abscisic acid-specific-binding protein from epidermis of broad bean leaves.;Purification of abscisic acid (ABA)-binding proteins is considered to constitute a major step toward isolating ABA receptors. We report here that an ABA-binding protein was for the first time, to our knowledge, purified from the epidermis of broad bean (Vicia faba) leaves via affinity chromatography. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing electrophoresis, and isoelectric focusing/sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis two-dimensional electrophoresis of the purified ABA-binding protein all identified a single protein band with a molecular mass of 42 kD and an isoelectric point 4.86. The Scatchard plot for the purified protein showed a linear function with a maximum binding activity of 0.87 mol mol(-1) protein and an equilibrium dissociation constant of 21 nM, indicating that the purified protein may be a monomeric one, possessing one binding site. The ABA-binding protein was enriched more than 300-fold with a yield of 14%. (-)ABA and trans-ABA were substantially incapable of displacing (3)H-(+/-)ABA bound to the ABA-binding protein, and (+/-)ABA was less effective than (+)ABA in the competition. These findings allow establishment of the stereospecificity of the 42-kD protein and suggest its ABA receptor nature. Pretreatment of the guard cell protoplasts of broad bean leaves with the monoclonal antibody raised against the 42-kD protein significantly decreased the ABA specific-induced phospholipase D activity in a dose-dependent manner. This physiological significance provides more clear evidence for the potential ABA-receptor nature of the 42-kD protein.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
22959269;Architecture of the nuclease module of the yeast Ccr4-not complex: the Not1-Caf1-Ccr4 interaction.;Shortening eukaryotic poly(A) tails represses mRNA translation and induces mRNA turnover. The major cytoplasmic deadenylase, the Ccr4-Not complex, is a conserved multisubunit assembly. Ccr4-Not is organized around Not1, a large scaffold protein that recruits two 3'-5' exoribonucleases, Caf1 and Ccr4. We report structural studies showing that the N-terminal arm of yeast Not1 has a HEAT-repeat structure with domains related to the MIF4G fold. A MIF4G domain positioned centrally within the Not1 protein recognizes Caf1, which in turn binds the LRR domain of Ccr4 and tethers the Ccr4 nuclease domain. The interactions that form the nuclease core of the Ccr4-Not complex are evolutionarily conserved. Their specific disruption affects cell growth and mRNA deadenylation and decay in vivo in yeast. Thus, the N-terminal arm of Not1 forms an extended platform reminiscent of scaffolding proteins like eIF4G and CBP80, and places the two nucleases in a pivotal position within the Ccr4-Not complex.;alanine;-;-;LCR_without_function

6878725;The significance of diagnostic laparotomy in girls with disorders of sexual development.;Chromosomal analyses were performed in 5 patients from 13 days to 16 years of age to clarify intersexual genitalia, disorders of secondary sexual development and growth retardation. Laparotomies were felt to be indicated because of discrepancies in the results of chromosoma analyses, clinical picture and endocrinologic findings. Among others, pure gonadal dysgenesis was found in a patient with karyotype 46 XX, functional ovaries in a chromosomal Turner's syndrome and a Müllerian anlage with two dysgenetic testes in a 45 X/46 XY mosaic. Since gonads with one cell line containing Y-chromosomes carry a high danger of malignant change, they should be removed as early as possible. It is known that disorders of sexual development can be caused by many and various anomalies of the sex chromosomes.

25827755;Cryptic 3' mRNA processing signals hinder the expression of Schistosoma mansoni integrins in yeast.;The expression of parasite genes has often proven difficult in heterologous systems such as yeast or E. coli. Most often, promoter choice and codon usage were hypothesised to be the main reason for expression failures. The trematode parasite Schistosoma mansoni has five integrin genes named Smα-Int1-4 and Smβ-Int1, which we aimed to express in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This has not been achieved, however, as only Smβ-Int1 integrin could be expressed. When the four α integrins were driven by a stronger promoter, this enabled Smα-Int1 to be expressed as well, but the remaining integrins, Smα-Int2-4, still could not be expressed. Evidence from RT-PCR experiments suggested that this was due to premature transcription termination. Using detailed in silico sequence analyses we identified AT-rich stretches in these integrin genes, which have high similarity to yeast mRNA 3'-end processing signals. We hypothesised that these signals were causing the premature truncation. To test this, we designed an optimised version of Smα-Int3, in which the sequence was modified to replace the yeast 3' processing signals. This strategy allowed us to express Smα-Int3 integrin successfully in S. cerevisiae. These findings show that the misinterpretation of AT-rich sequences by yeast 3'-mRNA processing machinery can cause problems when attempting to express genes containing such sequences in this host.;threonine;-;-;LCR_without_function
26899911;Histone acetyltransferease p300 modulates TIM4 expression in dendritic cells.;"TIM4 (T cell immunoglobulin mucin domain molecule-4) plays a critical role in the initiation of skewed T helper (Th) 2 polarization. The factors regulating TIM4 expression are unclear. This study tests a hypothesis that p300 and STAT6 (signal transducer and activator transcription-6) regulates TIM4 expression in dendritic cells (DC). In this study, a food allergy mouse model was developed with ovalbumin (a specific antigen) and cholera toxin (CT; an adjuvant). The chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed to evaluate the chromatin changes at TIM4 and STAT6 promoters. The TIM4 expression was evaluated by real time RT-PCR and Western blotting. The results showed that high levels of p300 and TIM4 were detected in the intestinal DCs of mice with intestinal allergy. p300 is involved in the CT-induced TIM4 expression in DCs. p300 interacts with the chromatin at the TIM4 promoter locus in DCs isolated from allergic mice. CT increases p300 expression to regulate STAT6 levels in DCs. STAT6 mediates the CT-induced TIM4 expression in DCs. In conclusion, p300 and STAT6 mediate the microbial product CT-induced TIM4 expression in DCs.";-;antigen;-;hard_2
7901967;Influence of culture substrata on the differentiation of advanced passage glial cells in cultures from aged mouse cerebral hemispheres.;We have previously reported that glial cells derived from aged mouse cerebral hemispheres (MACH) in primary cultures and after several passages consist of protoplasmic astrocytes (Type 1), differentiated stellate astrocytes (Type 2), a few oligodendrocytes, and also glial precursors. In this study, we examined the influence of culture substrata: plastic, poly-L-lysine, laminin or collagen on the differentiation of MACH glial cells of advanced passages (P18-19) using glutamine synthetase (GS) and cyclic nucleotide phosphohydrolase (CNP) activity as biochemical markers for astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, respectively. Cultures were also examined morphologically using light microscopy. In general, GS activity was increased in cultures grown on the three chemical substrata versus plastic alone with the most striking effect being the 2-fold increase observed in those cells grown in laminin. No differences were noted in CNP activity. Morphologically, proliferation of protoplasmic (Type 1) astrocytes was enhanced by culture day 2 on polylysine substratum and stellate differentiated (Type 2) astrocytes were noted on collagen. The striking feature in cultures grown on laminin was the presence of astrocytes with markedly long processes. Thus, morphological astrocyte differentiation appears to correspond to the increased GS activity. We propose that the extracellular matrix components such as collagen and laminin may play an important role in promoting glial precursors to differentiate into astrocytes.;lysine;-;poly-L-;LCR_with_hard
9522450;Sequencing of porA from clinical isolates of Neisseria meningitidis defines a subtyping scheme and its genetic regulation.;"Subtyping Neisseria meningitidis by methods that rely on monoclonal antibody (mAb) reactivity results in an unusually high number of strains that are not subtypeable. To subtype 48 strains isolated (1993-1994) in the province of Quebec that were not subtypeable by mAb-based techniques, we used DNA sequencing of the variable regions of porA, a gene that encodes the class 1 outer membrane protein. We assigned subtypes to all the previously nonserosubtypeable isolates and identified some novel subtypes. Because our sequencing strategy included the promoter region of porA, different isolates were compared in their sequences of the porA promoter region. A poly(G) stretch lies between the -10 and -35 regions of the promoter; replacement of a G residue by an A residue in this region resulted in loss of expression of porA. No correlation was found between the number of G residues in the poly(G) stretch and the level of expression; a minimum of 10 G residues is required in this stretch for expression of porA. One isolate expressed no class 1 outer membrane protein because of the insertion sequence IS1301 in the coding region of porA. Another isolate did not express the protein owing to a frame-shift mutation within the coding region of porA. Sequencing of porA allowed assignments of subtypes to previously uncharacterized isolates and provided insights about the regulation of expression of this gene in N. meningitidis.";glycine;-;-;LCR_without_function

313605;A chemical approach to the mechanism of B-lymphocyte activation. III. The B-cell-activating structure of T-independent antigens resides ultimately in the carrier.;"Non-immunogenic dinitrophenyl-polymethylmethacrylate and dinitrophenyl-cellulose were rendered immunogenic by introducing, or by exposing, hydroxyl groups; i.e. hydrogen bonds. Conversely, acetylation of Ficoll yielded a polymer no longer functioning as a good carrier, and a similar result was obtained when dipole and hydrogen bond-supplying groups of polyacrylamide were replaced by more hydrophobic chains. All these findings point towards the existence of a carrier-associated lymphocyte-triggering structure. Despite the latter conclusion, the carrier need not be a polyclonal antibody inductor. The possibility of a signal not resulting in polyclonal antibody induction was tested with the system Ficoll/dinitrophenyl-Ficoll: whereas a pulse of Ficoll specifically impaired the immunogenicity of dinitrophenyl-Ficoll, it did not elicit a significant antibody level increase over background. Nevertheless, repetitive Ficoll inoculations into mice gradually increased the basal anti-trinitrophenyl antibody level, and concomitantly the anti-dinitrophenyl response to dinitrophenyl-Ficoll was specifically impaired since the anti-trinitrophenyl response to trinitrophenyl-LPS was unaffected. The two main conclusions are that (1) the ultimate lymphocyte-triggering structure resides in the carrier, and (2) the mere presence of that carrier-associated structure does not mean polyclonal antibody induction, at least under conventional test conditions (i.e. one pulse, 2 days in culture).";-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
9008280;Human humoral responses to antigens of Mycobacterium tuberculosis: immunodominance of high-molecular-mass antigens.;The selection of antigens of Mycobacterium tuberculosis for most studies of humoral responses in tuberculosis patients has been restricted to molecules that were either immunodominant in immunized animals or amenable to biochemical purification rather than those that were reactive with the human immune system. Delineation of antigens that elicit humoral responses during the natural course of disease progression in humans has been hindered by the presence of cross-reactive antibodies to conserved regions on ubiquitous prokaryotic antigens in sera from healthy individuals and tuberculosis patients. The levels of cross-reactive antibodies in the sera were reduced by preadsorption with Escherichia coli lysates, prior to studying their reactivity against a large panel of M. tuberculosis antigens to which the human immune system may be exposed during natural infection and disease. Thus, reactivity against pools of secreted, cellular, and cell wall-associated antigens of M. tuberculosis was assessed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Initial results suggested that the secreted protein preparation contained antigens most frequently recognized by the humoral responses of pulmonary tuberculosis patients. The culture filtrate proteins were subsequently size fractionated by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, characterized by reaction with murine monoclonal antibodies to known antigens of M. tuberculosis by an ELISA, and assessed for reactivity with tuberculous and nontuberculous sera. Results show that a secreted antigen of 88 kDa elicits a strong antibody response in a high percentage of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. This and other antigens identified on the basis of their reactivity with patient sera may prove useful for developing serodiagnosis for tuberculosis.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
6375928;A study of the reliability of carcinoembryonic antigen blood levels in following the course of colorectal cancer.;"Twenty-three patients were studied to assess the reliability of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels in following the course of colorectal cancer. CEA estimations were made prior to surgery and again postoperatively. The resected specimens were allocated a Dukes' Stage and histological grading (well, moderate or poorly differentiated). In addition, sections were stained for the presence of CEA by an immunoperoxidase method. Of the 23 patients, twelve had either disseminated disease at initial surgery or subsequently developed metastasis/recurrence. Eleven remain disease-free at a minimum follow-up of one year. In all of these the reliability of plasma CEA values in reflecting the disease status has been assessed. No false positive elevations of CEA were found. Three factors emerge as positive predictors of CEA estimation reliability: pre-operative CEA elevation; tumour grading as well differentiated; dark staining for the presence of CEA. These factors identified 15 of the 18 patients (83%) in whom CEA appeared reliable and were not present in any of the five patients where CEA was not reliable. This reliability achieves statistical significance (X2 = 8.5, p less than 0.02).

Antiserum used to demonstrate material B, an adhesive antigen thought to mediate the adhesive and mannose-resistant (MR) haemagglutinating properties of E. coli strains 1676, 1706 and 1751, reacted in vitro with an F41+ strain. The antiserum also inhibited the MR haemagglutinating activity of F41 antigen and gave an anionic precipitation line in immunoelectrophoresis experiments with an extract containing F41 antigen. The MR haemagglutinating properties of an antigen extract containing material B from E. coli strain 1706 was neutralized by antiserum to F41 fimbriae and by OK antisera to E. coli strains that produce both F41 and K99 fimbriae.

1717267;A second pathway of activation of the Torpedo acetylcholine receptor channel.;We have studied the interaction of the reversible acetylcholine esterase inhibitor (-)physostigmine (D-eserine) with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) from Torpedo marmorata electric tissue by means of ligand-induced ion flux into nAChR-rich membrane vesicles and of equilibrium binding. We find that (-) physostigmine induces cation flux (and also binds to the receptor) even in the presence of saturating concentrations of antagonists of acetylcholine, such as D-tubocurarine, alpha-bungarotoxin or antibody WF6. The direct action on the acetylcholine receptor is not affected by removal of the methylcarbamate function from the drug and thus is not due to carbamylation of the receptor. Antibodies FK1 and benzoquinonium antagonize channel activation (and binding) of eserine, suggesting that the eserine binding site(s) is separate from, but adjacent to, the acetylcholine binding site at the receptor. In addition to the channel activating site(s) with an affinity of binding in the 50 microM range, there exists a further class of low-affinity (Kd approximately mM) sites from which eserine acts as a direct blocker of the acetylcholine-activated channel.

As MT has the ability to scavenge hydroxyl radicals, MT may control intracellular redox status. In the present study, we examined whether MT regulates the activity of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), which is one of the redox-regulated transcription factors, using the MT null embryonic cell lines established from MT null mice. We first found that tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced activation of the binding of NF-kappaB protein to DNA in wild type MT+/+ cells was lower than that in MT-/- cells. The NF-kappaB activation in MT-expressing cells established from MT-/- cells by the transfection of mouse MT-1 gene was also significantly lower than that in MT-/- cells. In addition, transfection of the MT gene inhibited TNF-induced IkappaB degradation and suppressed NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression induced by TNF.

We provide evidence that the abundance of huntingtin 3' UTR isoforms differs between patient and control neural stem cells, fibroblasts, motor cortex, and cerebellum. Huntingtin 3' UTR isoforms, including a mid-3' UTR isoform, have different localizations, half-lives, polyA tail lengths, microRNA sites, and RNA-binding protein sites. Isoform shifts in Huntington's disease motor cortex are not limited to huntingtin; 11% of alternatively polyadenylated genes change the abundance of their 3' UTR isoforms. Altered expression of RNA-binding proteins may be associated with aberrant isoform abundance; knockdown of the RNA-binding protein CNOT6 in control fibroblasts leads to huntingtin isoform differences similar to those in disease fibroblasts.

The protein moiety of gp71A was digested with Staphylococcus aureus (SV8) protease, trypsin, and thermolysin. The sequences of the peptides were determined by the micro dansyl Edman procedure. gp71A is composed of 445 amino acid residues and contains eight oligosaccharide side chains, which are attached exclusively to asparagine by N-glycosyl bonds primarily in the COOH-terminal half of the polypeptide. gp71A is rich in proline (49 residues), tryptophan (16 residues), and cysteine (19 residues). Proline has the highest molar content (11%) of all amino acids. The prolines cluster in two segments. The most interesting one stretches between residue 233 and residue 283 and contains 18 prolines within 51 amino acids. This proline-rich domain most likely forms a flexible polyproline helix. The comparison of gp70 of Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV gp70) with F-MuLV gp71A revealed that 70 amino acids have been exchanged and 9 residues have been deleted from Mo-MuLV gp70. The most striking alterations have taken place within the large polyproline segment (residues 247 to 281). In this part of the molecule 7 amino acids have been deleted in Mo-MuLV and 18 residues have been replaced. This evidence supports the proposal of Shinnick et al. [Shinnick, T. M., Lerner, R.

In addition, other properties of serologically distinct BCMV strains were compared. Two groups of BCMV strains were obtained by ELISA and Western blot serology: serotype A contained the BCMV strains NL3, NL5, and NL8 and serotype B contained the BCMV strains NL1, NL2, NL4, NL6, US4, NL7, NY15, and Fla. SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting of freshly purified preparations, and of extracts from leaves infected with eleven BCMV strains showed that the apparent molecular mass of the capsid protein of the serotype A isolates NL3, NL5, and NL8 are lower (about M(r) 33,000) than those of the serotype B isolates (M(r) 34,500 to 35,000). The normal lengths of the particles of the serotype A isolates were shorter (810-818 nm) than those of most isolates (except NL6 and NY15) of serotype B (847-886 nm). All isolates studied induced cytoplasmic pinwheel and scroll inclusions. Cells infected with serotype A isolates contained a specific type of proliferated endoplasmic reticulum which was never found in cells infected with serotype B isolates. The capsid protein gene of a representative member of each serotype was cloned and sequenced. Molecular mass calculations based upon nucleotide sequence-derived amino acid sequences yielded M(r) of 29,662 and 32,489 for the capsid proteins of the serotype A isolate NL8 and the serotype B isolate NL4, respectively. Comparison of the coat-protein sequences showed considerable differences at the N-termini whereas the core regions and the C-termini appeared to be highly conserved. Marked differences were also observed within the 3' non-coding regions of cloned cDNAs of NL 4 and NL 8. The striking differences between the two serotypes of BCMV strongly suggest that they be classified as two distinct potyviruses which naturally infect Phaseolus beans.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
6093313;Purification of the mitochondrial triiodothyronine (T3) receptor from rat liver.;The thyroid hormone receptor of the inner membrane of rat liver mitochondria was purified by osmotic and freeze-thaw lyses followed by partial purification on Sephadex G-200, and then by affinity chromatography with T3-Sepharose 4B. A single predominant protein band demonstrable on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was present in the first 4 mM NaOH elution peak of affinity chromatography. This was collected from affinity peaks from about 30 rat livers followed by preparative PAGE. A single absorbance peak was observed by high pressure liquid chromatography. The purified protein was analyzed for binding constants, amino acid composition, and characterized by analytical ultracentrifuge. The association constant (KA) exceeded 10(11) M-1. The sedimentation coefficient (S20,w) was 2.2 S, the partial specific volume (v) was 0.72, the frictional coefficient [(f/f0)sM] was 1.68, and the molecular weight was estimated at 28,000.

1156382;Thymidine kinase of mouse spleen cells in vivo and in vitro.;The thymidine kinase activity of mouse spleen cells was found to parallel their DNA-synthesizing ability, both in vivo and in vitro. In the former case, more than 90% of the activity of these cells was found in the cytoplasmic fraction. This activity was labile, as was its template mRNA, compared with the nuclear component. The nuclear enzyme increased during culture of the lymphocytes in vitro. Mitogenic stimulation with concanavalin A resulted not only in a greater enhancement of the nuclear activity, but also in a marked increase in the amount of cytoplasmic enzyme. This effect appeared to be mediated via stabilization of the mRNA for the cytoplasmic component. These differences have been considered, especially with respect to the cellular changes that occurred during culture and mitogenic stimulation.;-;kinase activity;-;hard_2
26696975;Resistance Mutations in gyrA and parC are Common in Escherichia Communities of both Fluoroquinolone-Polluted and Uncontaminated Aquatic Environments.;Alterations in the target proteins of fluoroquinolones, especially in GyrA and ParC, are known to cause resistance. Here, we investigated environmental Escherichia communities to explore the possible link between the abundance of mutations, and the exposure to fluoroquinolones. Sediment samples were collected from a relatively pristine lake, up and downstream from a sewage treatment plant, and from several industrially polluted sites. The quinolone resistance-determining regions of gyrA and parC were analyzed using amplicon sequencing of metagenomic DNA. Five non-synonymous substitutions were present in all samples, and all of these mutations have been previously linked to fluoroquinolone resistance in Escherichia coli. In GyrA, substitutions S83L and D87N were on average detected at frequencies of 86 and 32%, respectively, and 31% of all amplicons encoded both substitutions. In ParC, substitutions S80I, E84G, and E84V were detected in 42, 0.9, and 6.0% of the amplicons, respectively, and 6.5% encoded double substitutions. There was no significant correlation between the level of fluoroquinolone pollution and the relative abundance of resistance mutations, with the exception of the most polluted site, which showed the highest abundance of said substitutions in both genes. Our results demonstrate that resistance mutations can be common in environmental Escherichia, even in the absence of a fluoroquinolone selective pressure.;-;-;-;hard_0
8257633;Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) trans-activator (Tat): functional domains and the search for trans-dominant negative mutants.;"Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) trans-activator (Tat) is an important trans-regulator of viral gene expression. It differs from the related HIV-1 Tat in certain aspects of its structure and function. HIV-2 Tat is composed of 130 amino acids versus 86 amino acids for HIV-1 Tat. Apart from certain conserved regions, there is little homology between the two Tats. They also differ in their ability to trans-activate HIV-2 and HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR)-directed gene expression. As an aid to understanding its mechanism of action, the functional domains important for HIV-2 Tat trans-activation of HIV-2 and HIV-1 LTR-directed gene expression were investigated. Like HIV-1 Tat, HIV-2 Tat contains conserved cysteine- and arginine-rich domains important for its function. However, HIV-2 Tat differs from HIV-1 Tat in that about 20% of the HIV-2 Tat at the amino terminus was not essential for its trans-activation function while HIV-1 Tat amino terminus is reportedly a part of its activation domain. Similarly, about 30% of the protein at the carboxy terminus of HIV-2 Tat was not essential. A domain critical for HIV-2 Tat-mediated trans-activation was located just upstream of the cysteine-rich domain. This segment is predicted to adopt an alpha-helical conformation and also contains acidic amino acid residues; thus, it may resemble amphipathic helix-type activation domains found in some transcriptional factors. A region with predicted hydrophobic alpha-helical character located between the cysteine- and arginine-rich domains was also important for HIV-2 Tat function. HIV-2 Tat mutants that were analogs of HIV-1 Tat trans-dominant negative mutants did not display such a phenotype.";arginine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
3014781;Structural components of bovine leukemia virus: further biochemical and immunological characterization of major structural proteins and glycoproteins.;Proteins from bovine leukemia virus (BLV) were investigated by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence and absence of 14C amino acids. Virus grown either in fetal lamb kidney (FLK) or bat lung (BL) cells revealed seven major proteins designated p10, p12, p15(1), p15(2), p24, gp30, and gp64. By tryptic peptide analysis, N-terminal amino acid analysis and radioimmunoassay it could be shown that p10, a basic protein with hydrophobic properties, is a cleavage product of p15(2), the acidic and slightly hydrophobic phosphoprotein of BLV. The structural protein p12 was shown to be a phosphorylated protein identifying it as a second major viral protein to contain phosphorous. Investigation of [3H]glucosamine incorporation, N-terminal amino acid analysis and hydrophobic properties by chloroform-methanol extraction confirmed properties of gp30 and gp64 predicted by nucleotide sequence data.

6889314;Uptake of iopanoic acid and its glucuronide conjugate by rat hepatocytes in primary culture.;Uptake of iopanoic acid (IOP) and iopanoate glucuronide (IOP-G) was studied in 3-day primary cultures of rat hepatocytes isolated by the collagenase perfusion method. 125I activity of cells after incubation with 125I-IOP (10-100 microM) and 125I-IOP-G (10-100 microM) was used as a measure of uptake. At each concentration, uptake was linear for the first 45 sec. In the absence of albumin, the initial uptake velocity was directly proportional to the concentration or IOP or IOP-G and was nonsaturable up to 100 microM. The calculated uptake rate constants for IOP and for IOP-G were 0.059 and 0.048 nmole/(mg protein X min X microM), respectively. IOP uptake was not inhibited by sodium taurocholate nor by the contrast agents iodipamide, ipodate, and iopronic acid. The data indicate that the enhancement of IOP excretion by bile salts noted in vivo does not occur at the uptake step and that the hepatic uptake of both IOP and IOP-G in the absence of albumin is limited by diffusion.;-;-;-;hard_0
1447639;Effects of brief early exposure to partially hydrolyzed and whole cow milk proteins.;"Clinical experience (""the dangerous bottle"") and experimental evidence indicate that the early life of an infant is particularly important for the development of the immune responses to food antigens. However, the clinical and immunologic consequences of a brief exposure to, or avoidance of, food antigens during the neonatal period in human infants are poorly understood and documented. We present the preliminary results of a prospective controlled study of 256 normal breast-fed infants randomly assigned to receive (blind) either an adapted formula (Nidina) or a partially hydrolyzed formula (Nidal HA) as a supplement to breast-feeding for a few days when necessary, and to be examined at days 5, 90, 150, and 365. The results indicated that (1) the prevalence of clinical symptoms and of total and specific IgE responses was not statistically different in the two groups of infants and (2) infants fed a hydrolyzed formula had median titers of specific IgG lower than those fed an adapted formula; the difference was significant for alpha-lactalbumin at day 90 (p < 0.005) and for alpha-lactalbumin (p < 0.05), casein (p < 0.05), and hydrolyzed formula (p < 0.01) at day 150.

3354197;Formation of transmembraneous hepatitis B e-antigen by cotranslational in vitro processing of the viral precore protein.;The gene encoding the major core protein P22c of hepatitis B virus is preceded by a precore sequence. Expression of the core gene with the precore in Escherichia coli results in a membrane protein of HBe antigenicity. Expression in mammalian cells generates secreted HBeAg. To study the biosynthetic pathway of HBeAg and the function of precore in this process, we translated mRNAs for core proteins with and without precore using reticulocyte lysates and microsomal vesicles. The precore sequence was cleaved cotranslationally as a signal peptide, probably at alanine 19. The processed product P23e was partially translocated to the lumen of the microsomes. The arginine-rich carboxy-terminal domain of P23e was however not translocated and susceptible to trypsin. Clusters of positive-charged amino acids seem to act as a novel type of translocation stop signal. Trypsin generated a P16e which no longer had a transmembraneous configuration.

A second 3.2-kb Bg/II fragment was identified and cloned with the 2-kb EcoRI fragment as a probe. The nucleotide sequence of 1.8 kb of this DNA was determined and was shown to encode the entire fragment C and a portion of fragment B of tetanus toxin. The tetanus DNA was expressed in E. coli with pWRL507, a plasmid vector containing the trp promoter and a portion of the trpE gene.

22392880;Hexapeptide fragment of carcinoembryonic antigen which acts as an agonist of heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein M.;Colorectal cancers with metastatic potential secrete the glycoprotein carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). CEA has been implicated in colorectal cancer metastasis by inducing Kupffer cells to produce inflammatory cytokines which, in turn, make the hepatic micro-environment ideal for tumor cell implantation. CEA binds to the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein M (hnRNP M) which acts as a cell surface receptor in Kupffer cells. The amino acid sequence in CEA, which binds the hnRNP M receptor, is Tyr-Pro-Glu-Leu-Pro-Lys. In this study, the structure of Ac-Tyr-Pro-Glu-Leu-Pro-Lys-NH₂ (YPELPK) was investigated using electronic circular dichroism, vibrational circular dichroism, and molecular dynamics simulations. The binding of the peptide to hnRNP M was also investigated using molecular docking calculations. The biological activity of YPELPK was studied using differentiated human THP-1 cells, which express hnRNP M on their surface and secrete IL-6 when stimulated by CEA. YPELPK forms a stable polyproline-II helix and stimulates IL-6 production of THP-1 cells at micromolar concentrations. ;proline;helix;-;LCR_with_function
8888429;Mucosal irritation, adaptive cytoprotection, and adaptation to topical ammonia in the rat stomach.;"BACKGROUND
The urease-ammonia (NH4OH) system has been proposed to play a major role in the pathogenesis of the Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis, but the mechanism of the mucosal damage has not been fully explained. This study was designed to examine possible adaptive cytoprotection and the adaptation of rat gastric mucosa to the irritant action of NH4OH and urease.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Single application of NH4OH alone in various concentrations (15-500 mM) caused concentration-dependent mucosal damage starting with 30 mM and reaching a maximum at 250 mM NH4OH, similar to that obtained with 100% ethanol; it was accompanied by a decrease in gastric blood flow (GBF) to approximately 30% of the normal value. When the mucosa was first exposed to the low, non-damaging concentration (15 mM) of NH4OH and then insulted with 100% ethanol, the extent of ethanol damage was greatly attenuated as compared with that caused by ethanol alone. This adaptive cytoprotection was accompanied by the rise in GBF and reversed, in part, by the pretreatment with indomethacin, an inhibitor of prostaglandin (PG)-cyclooxygenase; with L-NAME, a blocker of NO-synthase; or with capsaicin deactivating the sensory nerves. Damaging concentrations of NH4OH (125 mM) caused widespread mucosal damage after the first application, but with repeated insults with 125 mM NH4OH a gradual reduction in the mucosal lesions, accompanied by enhanced mucosal cell proliferation and over-expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF) (using immunocytochemistry) and mRNA of EGF (using trans-reverse polymerase chain reaction), were observed.


CONCLUSIONS
NH4OH alone damages gastric mucosa only at the concentration exceeding that found in H. pylori-infected stomachs, whereas at lower concentrations it acts as 'mild' irritant to induce adaptive cytoprotection. This adaptive cytoprotection appears to be mediated, in part, by endogenous PG, sensory nerves, and an arginine-NO-dependent pathway, and repeated applications of NH4OH induce gastric adaptation, probably mediated by enhanced expression of EGF and its receptors and by an increased cell proliferation.";-;-;-;hard_0
1437158;Structural organization of a src gene from Xenopus laevis.;By sequence analysis of genomic clones, the exon-intron structure of one of the two src genes from Xenopus laevis has been determined. The coding region of the gene is interrupted by 10 introns whose locations are identical to the introns in the coding regions of the src genes of human and chicken. The 5' untranslated region is contained on a separate exon with no sequence conservation relative to the corresponding region of the chicken gene. The 5' untranslated region of the Xenopus gene contains a G + C-rich stem-loop sequence and two ATG triplets. A 1.4-kb fragment containing the 5' untranslated region and sequences upstream of it acts as a promoter when introduced in the correct orientation into X. laevis cell lines. The DNA sequence of this fragment lacks the typical arrangement of TATA and CCAAT sequences but contains the ATGCAAAT octamer sequence and a (TA)39 sequence.;cysteine;-;-;LCR_without_function
3337845;Inhibition of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase by the polar head group of an insulin-sensitive glycophospholipid.;A glycophospholipid has been purified from rat liver membranes and shown to copurify with an insulin-sensitive glycophospholipid isolated from H35 hepatoma cells. The polar head group of this glycophospholipid is a phospho-oligosaccharide generated by treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Staphylococcus aureus. It has been proposed that this phospho-oligosaccharide, which is also generated in response to insulin, may play a role in insulin action. Incubation of the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase with this phospho-oligosaccharide inhibited the activity of the kinase to phosphorylate histone IIA, a purified preparation of phospholipid methyltransferase and kemptide, a phosphate-accepting peptide. Inhibition of kinase activity was dose-dependent and 50% inhibition of histone phosphorylation was demonstrated with a concentration of phospho-oligosaccharide of around 2 microM. This effect was demonstrated in the presence of ATP at concentrations up to 1 mM, indicating that the phospho-oligosaccharide acts at physiological concentrations of ATP and that it does not compete with this nucleotide for the same binding site in the kinase. Inhibition by the phospho-oligosaccharide of kinase activity could be reversed by dilution or dialysis and was not reproduced by up to 50 microM myo-inositol, glucosamine, galactose, myo-inositol 1-phosphate, glucosamine 1-phosphate, galactose 1-phosphate or phosphorylcholine. The inhibitory activity was resistant to mild acid treatment but was labile to treatment with alkali, exposure to nitrous acid or incubation with sodium periodate. The phospho-oligosaccharide had no effect on the phosphorylation of lysine-rich histone by rat brain protein kinase C and on the binding of cyclic AMP to a cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. In conclusion, the data in this study suggested that a phospho-oligosaccharide generated from an insulin-sensitive glycophospholipid may play a role in insulin action by modulating cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity. ;lysine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
25345808;Toll-like receptor agonists shape the immune responses to a mannose receptor-targeted cancer vaccine.;Previous studies have documented that selective delivery of protein antigens to cells expressing mannose receptor (MR) can lead to enhanced immune responses. We postulated that agents that influenced the MR expression level, and the activation and migration status of MR-expressing antigen presenting cells, would modulate immune responses to MR-targeted vaccines. To address this question, we investigated the effect of clinically used adjuvants in human MR transgenic (hMR-Tg) mice immunized with an MR-targeting cancer vaccine composed of the human anti-MR monoclonal antibody B11 fused with the oncofetal protein, human chorionic gonadotropin beta chain (hCGβ), and referred to as B11-hCGβ. We found that humoral responses to low doses of B11-hCGβ could be enhanced by prior administration of GM-CSF, which upregulated MR expression in vivo. However, co-administration of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, poly-ICLC and/or CpG with B11-hCGβ was required to elicit Th1 immunity, as measured by antigen-specific T-cell production of IFN-γ. The TLR agonists were shown to increase the number of vaccine-containing cells in the draining lymph nodes of immunized hMR-Tg mice. In particular, with B11-hCGβ and poly-ICLC, a dramatic increase in vaccine-positive cells was observed in the T-cell areas of the lymph nodes, compared to the vaccine alone or combined with GM-CSF. Importantly, the absence of the TLR agonists during the priming immunization led to antigen-specific tolerance. Therefore, this study provides insight into the mechanisms by which adjuvants can augment immune responses to B11-hCGβ and have implications for the rationale design of clinical studies combining MR-targeted vaccination with TLR agonists. ;isoleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
6266059;The Epstein-Barr virus in the pathogenesis of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders. Clinical, pathologic, and virologic correlation.;Twelve renal transplant patients with lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs) were studied. Two clinical patterns were identified: (1) Young patients present with an infectious mononucleosis-like illness with fever, sore throat, and lymphadenopathy soon after transplantation or antirejection therapy. Many organs are ultimately involved, and the clinical course is one of a rapidly fatal LPD. (2) Older patients present a longer time after transplantation with symptoms of solid tumors involving the central nervous system, oropharynx, liver, or small bowel. The clinical course is slower, but it is progressive and fatal. Morphologically these LPDs can all be classified as polymorphic diffuse B-cell hyperplasia (PDBH) or polymorphic diffuse B-cell lymphoma (PBL). Cell marker studies in four patients demonstrated a polyclonal B-cell proliferation. Transition from a polyclonal B-cell proliferation to a monoclonal tumor may occur. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) specific antibody titers, anticomplement immunofluorescence staining of tumors for the presence of the Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA), and EBV complementary ribonucleic acid (cRNA)/deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) hybridization and vDNA/DNA reassociation analysis implicate EBV as the probable etiologic agent in these disorders. Successful management of these lethal LPDs may depend on discontinuation of immunosuppression and removal of the allograft. Antiviral therapy, however, may prove to be useful.;-;antigen;-;hard_2

1715970;Characterization of the pea ENOD12B gene and expression analyses of the two ENOD12 genes in nodule, stem and flower tissue.;The ENOD12 gene family in pea consists of two different members. The cDNA clone, pPsENOD12, represents the PsENOD12A gene. The second ENOD12 gene, PsENOD12B, was selected from a genomic library using pPsENOD12 as a probe and this gene was sequenced and characterized. The coding regions of the two genes are strikingly similar. Both encode proteins having a signal peptide sequence and a region with pentapeptide units rich in prolines. ENOD12A has a series of rather conserved repeating pentapeptide units, whereas in ENOD12B the number of pentapeptide units is less and these are less conserved. From the amino acid sequence it is obvious that the PsENOD12 genes encode proline-rich proteins which are closely related to proteins that have been identified as components of soybean cell walls (SbPRPs). Previously, Northern blot analyses had shown that ENOD12 genes are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. A high expression level is found in Rhizobium-infected roots and in nodules, whereas expression in flower and stem is lower. This raised the question of which gene is expressed where and when. The availability of the sequences of both ENOD12 genes allowed us to analyse the expression of the two genes separately. Specific oligonucleotides were used to copy the ENOD12 mRNAs and to amplify the cDNAs in a polymerase chain reaction. It was demonstrated that in all the tissues containing ENOD12 mRNA, both genes PsENOD12A and PsENOD12B are transcribed and that the relative amounts of PsENOD12A and PsENOD12B mRNA within each tissue are more or less equal. Moreover, the expression pattern during infection and nodule development is the same for the two genes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS);proline;-;-;LCR_without_function
28786558;Ser71 of αS1-Casein is Phosphorylated in Breast Milk-Evidence from Targeted Mass Analysis.;"The casein phosphoproteins in mother's milk supply calcium and phosphate ions and make them biologically available to the newborn. Human αS1-casein is of particular interest being also an autoantigen and proinflammatory cytokine. Phosphorylation of αS1-casein by casein kinase 2 completely abolishes binding to toll-like receptor 4 and proinflammatory effects. It is, however, not known, which amino acids are affected. Therefore, breast milk samples were analyzed in an effort to detect the phosphorylation sites of αS1-casein. Breast milk samples were tryptically digested. Target tandem MS analysis confirmed the known phosphorylation sites S33 and S41; evidence for pS89 was found in some samples. Experimental support for the presence of pS31 and pS34 was weak. Phosphorylation of a new site in αS1-casein, S71, was reproducibly measured in all samples, albeit at much lower intensity than pS33 and pS41. Phospho-occupancy rates varied greatly and could not be confidently correlated to other parameters within the cohort of 20 donors. The new phosphosite S71 is located in the neighborhood of the serine-rich region and may contribute to the cluster of high charge density at normal milk pH, likely exerting an influence on protein tertiary structure and thus function.

690511;Composition of proteins of mesenteric lymph chylomicrons in the rat and alterations produced upon exposure of chylomicrons to blood serum and serum proteins.;"Protein composition was determined in mesenteric lymph chylomicrons from fat-fed rats. Among the proteins of intermediate molecular weight, apoproteins A-I and the arginine-rich apoprotein accounted for 31% and 4% of the total protein mass, respectively. Apoprotein B and apoprotein A-IV each accounted for about 10% and proteins of low molecular weight (C apoproteins and apoprotein A-II) accounted for most of the remainder. Apoprotein A-I also accounted for more than 30% of the protein mass of mesenteric lymph lipoproteins of density less than 1.006 g/ml (""small chylomicrons"") obtained from rats fed glucose. Aproprotein A-I was partially dissociated from chylomicrons during brief ultracentrifugation. Both the arginine-rich apoprotein and the C apoproteins in rat blood serum were transferred to lymph chylomicrons from fat-fed rats during incubation in vitro. Content of arginine-rich apoprotein, determined immunochemically, increased six-fold when chylomicrons were diluted to a final concentration of 500 mg/dl in blood serum. Upon incubation of chylomicrons in equivalent volumes of ultracentrifugal fractions of serum, the increase of the arginine-rich apoprotein was: very low density lipoproteins, 1.5-fold; high density lipoproteins, 1.8-fold; density fraction greater than 1.006 g/ml, 5.0-fold; density fraction greater than 1.21 g/ml, 11-fold. Content of apoprotein A-I, also determined immunochemically, was not altered appreciably by exposure to serum or its ultracentrifugal fractions, whereas content of C apoproteins, estimated from intensity of staining of the low molecular weight protein component in polyacrylamide gel electropherograms, increased in all cases except for the density fraction greater than 1.21 g/ml. The fractional content of apoprotein A-I in the protein of chylomicrons fell after incubation, whereas that of the arginine-rich apoprotein remained constant or rose substantially. The fractional content of apoprotein A-IV in chylomicron-protein tended to follow that of apoprotein A-I, as judged from polyacrylamide gel electropherograms. Transfer of the arginine-rich and C apoproteins to chylomicrons from blood serum was directly related to the volume of serum in which the chylomicrons were diluted and occurred rapidly at room temperature or at 4 degrees C.";arginine;-;polyacrylamide;LCR_with_hard

25489139;Fertility preservation in reproductive age women with cancer.;Cancer may be detected at any age and could affect children, and reproductive age women as well. In recent years, cancer treatment has become less destructive and more specific. As a result, survival rates and quality of life following successful treatment have continuously improved. Cancer treatment typically involves surgery, chemo- or radiation therapy, or the combinations of these. These interventions often adversely affect the function of the reproductive organs. Chemo- and radiation therapy are known to be gonadotoxic. Survivors of oncologic therapy are typically rendered infertile primarily due to the loss of ovarian function. There are, however, several medical, surgical, and assisted reproductive technology options that could be and should be offered to those diagnosed with cancer and wish to maintain their fertility. Embryo cryopreservation has been available for decades and has been successfully applied for fertility preservation in women diagnosed with cancer. Recent advances in cryobiology have increased the efficacy of not just embryo but even oocyte and ovarian tissue freezing-thawing. Oocyte vitrification just like embryo cryopreservation requires the use of stimulation but does not require the patient to be in a stable relationship or accept the use of donor sperm. Ovarian tissue cryopreservation does not require stimulation and, following successful transplantation, provides the patient with the most eggs but is currently still considered experimental. This paper summarizes the various fertility-sparing medical, surgical and assisted reproductive technology options.

Type I modules are found exclusively in the region of titin localised in the A band, where they are arranged in a super-repeat pattern that correlates with the ultrastructure of the thick filament. No structure of a titin type I module has been reported so far. We have determined the structure of a representative type I module, A71, using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The structure has the predicted fibronectin type III fold. Titin-specific conserved residues are either located at the putative module-module interfaces or along one side of the protein surface. Several proline residues that contribute to two stretches in a polyproline II helix conformation are solvent-exposed and line up as a continuous ribbon extending over more than two-thirds of the module surface. Homology models of the type I module N-terminal to A71 (A70) and the double module A70-A71 were used to discuss possible intermodule interactions and their role in module-module orientation. As residues at the module-module interfaces are highly conserved, we speculate that similar interactions govern all of the interfaces between type I modules in titin. This conservation would lead to a regular multiple array of similar surface structures. Such an arrangement would allow arrays of contiguous type I modules to expose multiple proline stretches in a highly regular way and these may act as binding sites for other thick filament proteins. ;proline;helix;-;LCR_with_function
28576046;Fabrication of self-assembled vesicle nanoparticles of poly(l-lysine)-arachidic acid conjugates for a vascular endothelial growth factor carrier.;Numerous growth factors account for tissue and organ development and therapeutic efficiency. Hence, the delivery of growth factors is crucial in regenerative medical practice. However, the delivery of a single factor to regenerate tissues lacks clinical utility in many current approaches. We reported the delivery of the bioactive vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) from novel polymeric vesicles. Polymeric vesicles were prepared from the poly(l-lysine)-g-polylysine(AA) amphiphilic graft copolymer through the conjugation of arachidic acid (AA) with poly(l-lysine) for obtaining a VEGF carrier. The prepared copolymer can form a polymersome and effectively condense with VEGF without affecting its size and surface charges. The Gaussian curve fit (GCF) of amide I band were revealed that VEGF efficiently interact through the α-helix of the amphiphilic graft copolymer rather than β-sheet dominated poly(l-lysine). The polymersome-VEGF complex showed a considerably higher binding affinity, transfection efficiency, and less toxicity because of the peptide-based polymer backbone. Compared with the poly(l-lysine)-VEGF complex, polymersome-VEGF revealed a high secretion of VEGF and low toxicity. These polymersomes can deliver angiogenic factors in a controlled manner in tissue regeneration and biomedical engineering. ;lysine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
20805245;Highly redundant function of multiple AT-rich sequences as core promoter elements in the TATA-less RPS5 promoter of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.;In eukaryotes, protein-coding genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (pol II) together with general transcription factors (GTFs). TFIID, the largest GTF composed of TATA element-binding protein (TBP) and 14 TBP-associated factors (TAFs), plays a critical role in transcription from TATA-less promoters. In metazoans, several core promoter elements other than the TATA element are thought to be recognition sites for TFIID. However, it is unclear whether functionally homologous elements also exist in TATA-less promoters in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we identify the cis-elements required to support normal levels of transcription and accurate initiation from sites within the TATA-less and TFIID-dependent RPS5 core promoter. Systematic mutational analyses show that multiple AT-rich sequences are required for these activities and appear to function as recognition sites for TFIID. A single copy of these sequences can support accurate initiation from the endogenous promoter, indicating that they carry highly redundant functions. These results show a novel architecture of yeast TATA-less promoters and support a model in which pol II scans DNA downstream from a recruited site, while searching for appropriate initiation site(s). ;threonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
20974920;Ferredoxin:NADPH oxidoreductase is recruited to thylakoids by binding to a polyproline type II helix in a pH-dependent manner.;Ferredoxin:NADPH oxidoreductase (FNR) is a key enzyme of photosynthetic electron transport required for generation of reduction equivalents. Recently, two proteins were found to be involved in membrane-anchoring of FNR by specific interaction via a conserved Ser/Pro-rich motif: Tic62 and Trol. Our crystallographic study reveals that the FNR-binding motif, which forms a polyproline type II helix, induces self-assembly of two FNR monomers into a back-to-back dimer. Because binding occurs opposite to the FNR active sites, its activity is not affected by the interaction. Surface plasmon resonance analyses disclose a high affinity of FNR to the binding motif, which is strongly increased under acidic conditions. The pH of the chloroplast stroma changes dependent on the light conditions from neutral to slightly acidic in complete darkness or to alkaline at saturating light conditions. Recruiting of FNR to the thylakoids could therefore represent a regulatory mechanism to adapt FNR availability/activity to photosynthetic electron flow. ;proline;helix;-;LCR_with_function
204286;The role of nucleoside diphosphatase in a uridine nucleotide cycle associated with lactose synthesis in rat mammary-gland Golgi apparatus.;1. UDP-galactose utilization by isolated Golgi vesicles or rat mammary gland synthesizing lactose causes accumulation of UMP but not UDP, although UDP is the immediate product of lactose synthase (EC 2.4.1.22). 2. This can be ascribed to a nucleoside diphosphatase (EC 3.6.1.6), specific for UDP, GDP and IDP, activated by bivalent metal ions and apparently located on the luminal face of the Golgi membrane. 3. The uridine diphosphatase activity exceeds the total galactosyltransferase activity 5-fold, and is estimated to maintain UDP at about 14 micrometer within the Golgi lumen. 4. Evidence is given that UMP, but not UDP, penetrates the membrane and that UMP is rephosphorylated to UDP by a UMP kinase located in the cytosol. 5. Golgi-cytosol relationships with respect to lactose synthesis are formulated in terms of a uridine nucleotide cycle which throws new light on the energy cost and possible regulation of lactose synthesis.;-;phosphatase activity;-;hard_2

Xenoantiserum prepared in rabbits was used to identify this tumor antigen in Triton extracts by double immunodiffusion in agar. The antigen was partially purified using a combination of DEAE and Sephadex G200 chromatography followed by sucrose gradient isoelectric focusing. Isoelectric focusing also showed the antigen to have a pI at pH 4.7. Sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated the antigen to be of 37,000 molecular weight. The 125I protein A antibody-binding assay was used to further characterize the specificity of the antigen using rabbit antisera to the Triton extract.

Similarly, pancreatic RNase digestion of the irradiated poly(U20G) resulted in a mixture of the appropriate mononucleotides. A T2-RNase treatment of poly(A) irradiated with 2-propanol gave the modified Ado-21:3'-P, while T2-RNase digestion of poly(A) irradiated with D-ribose led to the cyclic modified mononucleotides, in addition to the modified mononucleotides.;alanine;-;-;LCR_without_function

T cells are eliminated from bone marrow by rosetting with sheep red blood cells, followed by differential agglutination of residual T lymphocytes in the non-rosetting population by the lectin, soybean agglutinin. The fraction unagglutinated by the lectin contains a high proportion of colony-forming cells and non detectable T cell alloreactivity in vitro.

11833698;Influence of calcium hydroxide dressing on the obturation of simulated lateral canals.;The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate what influence an interappointment dressing with calcium hydroxide might have on the ability to subsequently obturate simulated lateral canals. Twenty extracted single-rooted human teeth were instrumented at the working length to a #35 file before creating three simulated lateral canals on the mesial and distal surfaces of the root, one in each third, using a #15 engine reamer. After enlarging the root canals to a #45 file, the teeth were randomly divided into two groups of 10. In both groups AH26 was used as the sealer. In group A, the obturation was performed immediately using Ultrafil. In group B, root canals were filled with calcium hydroxide and incubated for 7 days. The teeth were then reinstrumented, irrigated with 2.5% sodium hypochlorite solution, dried with paper points, and obturated as in group A. Teeth in group A showed a larger number of filled lateral canals compared with those in group B. Statistical significant differences were observed when comparing the same third in the two groups (apical third p < 0.05, middle third p < 0.01, and coronal third p < 0.01). No differences were found among the different thirds in the same group (p > 0.05).;-;-;-;hard_0
17982138;SMS overexpression and knockdown: impact on cellular sphingomyelin and diacylglycerol metabolism, and cell apoptosis.;Sphingomyelin synthase (SMS), the last enzyme in the sphingomyelin (SM) biosynthetic pathway, uses ceramide and phosphatidylcholine as substrates to produce SM and diacylglycerol (DAG). To evaluate the role of SMS in apoptosis, we generated Chinese hamster ovary cells that stably express human SMS1 or SMS2. We found that SMS1 or SMS2 overexpression results in a significant increase in cellular levels of SM (24% or 20%) and DAG (35% or 31%), respectively, compared with controls. Cells overexpressing SMS1 or SMS2 were more likely to undergo lysis mediated by lysenin (a protein that causes lysis through its affinity with SM-rich microdomains in the plasma membrane) than were controls, indicating SM enrichment of the plasma membrane. SMS1 and SMS2 overexpression also led to higher retention of DiIC16 fluorescence compared with wild-type cells, indicating an increased number of detergent-insoluble microdomains and significantly increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha-mediated apoptosis. To further evaluate the relationship between SMS activity and cell apoptosis, we used SMS1 and SMS2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) to knock down their mRNA in THP-1-derived macrophages. We found that SMS1 or SMS2 siRNA significantly reduces intracellular SM (by 20% or 23%), plasma membrane SM (as indicated by the rate of lysenin-mediated cell lysis), and DAG levels (24% or 20%), respectively, while significantly reducing lipopolysaccharide-mediated apoptosis compared with controls. These results indicate that SMS1 and SMS2 are key factors in the control of SM and DAG levels within the cell and thus influence apoptosis.;methionine;-;-;LCR_without_function
6205252;Monoclonal antibodies to hog thyroglobulin recognizing disulfide-dependent conformational structures.;"Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to hog thyroglobulin (Tg) were obtained by fusion of myeloma cells with B-lymphocytes from mice immunized with the protein. The five MAbs were classified into three groups which recognized different determinants; (1) MAb 4, (2) MAbs 6 and 10, and (3) MAbs 16 and 18. MAb 16 was IgG2b and the others IgG1. The immunoreactivity of Tg to the five MAbs was lost after reduction of the protein under denaturing conditions but remained after limited digestion by proteolytic enzymes. Tryptic fragments were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electrophoretically blotted and stained by a peroxidase-linked second antibody. Various sized tryptic fragments reacted similarly with the three MAbs which had different determinant specificities.

2010621;Intrasplenic immunization for the induction of humoral and cell-mediated immunity to nitrocellulose-bound antigen.;Intrasplenic immunization of mice has been shown to induce both specific humoral and cell-mediated immunity to minute amounts of nitrocellulose-bound antigen, electroblotted from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The test antigens used were aberrantly expressed molecules immunoprecipitated from the lysate of highly immunogenic ('xenogenized') murine lymphoma cells, derived by mutagenesis from a parental, nonimmunogenic cell line. The stained bands of nitrocellulose blots corresponding to the appropriate molecular weights were cut out and the resulting strips deposited in the spleens of recipient mice on three occasions at 15 day intervals. 2 weeks later, the antibody response in the serum was analyzed using a standard ELISA procedure. Cell-mediated immunity was investigated in vitro in terms of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity to radiolabeled xenogenized tumor target cells. In vivo, the immunized mice were assayed for their ability to mount a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response following footpad challenge with the xenogenized tumor. Our results confirm previous data that the intrasplenic deposition of minute amounts of protein immobilized on a solid matrix effectively stimulates production of specific antibodies. In addition, our results demonstrate that this procedure may also result in the development of T cell-dependent responses detectable in in vitro and in vivo assays of cell-mediated immunity.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
2946693;Alteration of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase isozyme pools during heart development and aging.;"The nature of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase isozyme pools in fetal, neonatal, young adult (3 months), and aged (30 months) rat hearts was studied using chromatographic and immunological techniques. Furthermore, the changing subunit composition of each isozyme pool was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 6% slab gels and by immunoblotting with subunit-specific antibodies. Although all three subunit types were expressed in heart throughout life, total activity and the nature of the isozyme pools varied during neonatal development and in aged heart. In fetal heart, the complex tetramers containing all three subunits appeared to be the major isozyme types. As the heart matured to the young adult stage, the M-type subunit increased over 6-fold; whereas the changes in the other two subunits were considerably less. These data indicate that during neonatal heart maturation the isozymic pools progressively exhibited increased amounts of the tetrameric forms containing two or more M-type subunits. In aged heart relative to the young adult (3 months) heart, the total activity and proportion of M-type subunit in the isozymes were decreased; and consequently, the amounts of the M-rich isozymes were decreased. The shifts in the types of isozymes during heart maturation and subsequent aging were primarily due to changes in availability of the M-type subunit to participate in random assembly of the tetrameric isozymes.";methionine;-;polyacrylamide;LCR_with_hard
849484;The aggregation of basic polypeptide residues bound to heparin.;The molecular basis for heparin interactions with proteins has been explored with L-lysine copolymer : heparin complexes, measuring the conformational change and charge neutralization which accompany the complexation, using optical methods. Previous studies had shown that the basic homopolypeptides (poly-L-lysine, poly-L-arginine) assume alpha-helical conformation upon interaction with numerous glycosaminoglycans (including heparin). Thus, the unique specificity for heparin in the anticoagulation system (which involves two or more lysine residues on the antithrombin molecule) is not paralleled by the findings with the basic homopolymers. Results with mixed polypeptides, poly(lysine : tyrosine, 1 : 1) and poly(lysine : phenylalanine, 1.4 : 1), show that these protein models assume different conformational forms upon complexation with heparin, the former shows a poly-L-lysine-like beta-structure circular dichroism spectrum and the latter an alpha-helical structure. The change in circular dichroism spectra increases with the addition of heparin until the ratio of positive to negative charge is about one. Dye-binding studies of the two copolymer systems reveal that the charged groups of both reactants are largely blocked in the polypeptide complexes at a calculated charge ratio equal to one. The data indicate that heparin interaction with the cationic polypeptides causes them to assume either the alpha-helical or beta-structure depending upon the nature of the neighboring uncharged amino acid and its proclivity for alpha-helix or beta-structure.;-;helix;poly-L-;hard_3
29661014;A novel protocol for generating intact, whole-head spider cephalothorax tissue sections.;The diversity of spider behavior and sensory systems provides an excellent opportunity for comparative studies of the relationship between the brain and behavior. However, the morphology of spiders poses a challenge for histologists since the spider cephalothorax contains heterogeneous tissues and has both tough external and internal sclerotized regions. Unlike the heads of insects, the cephalothorax is highly pressurized, which can cause tissues to shift during processing and can reduce tissue cohesion in thick sections. This work describes a novel protocol for producing thick whole-head sections for morphological study by softening the exoskeleton and stabilizing friable tissue, without freezing or dehydration. It also presents an effective whole-head DiI staining method that uses minimal dehydration and highlights neural structures.;-;-;-;hard_0
1333155;Mitochondrial F-type ATPases: the glycine-rich loop of the beta-subunit is a pyrophosphate binding domain.;The beta-subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex comprises the bulk, if not all, of the catalytic nucleotide binding site on the enzyme. A region of homologous sequence rich in glycines (G) and containing a basic lysine (K) and a threonine (T) is found in the beta-subunit as well as many other purine nucleotide binding proteins. The consensus sequence of this region is Gx4GKT, where x represents any amino acid, and is called the A region or glycine-rich loop. The related function of these proteins implies that the glycine-rich loop is directly involved in nucleotide binding. Here we directly test the involvement of the beta-subunit's glycine-rich region in adenine nucleotide binding using two independent approaches. A synthetic fifty amino acid peptide, PP-50, containing the glycine-rich region and the surrounding sequence was assessed for secondary structure and interaction with potential ligands. Circular dichroism spectropolarimetry indicates that PP-50 assumes a predominantly beta-sheet conformation in solution. Significantly, the peptide precipitates from solution when ATP, ADP, GTP, ITP, and pyrophosphate are added, but not when AMP or phosphate are included. Magnesium is not required for the interaction with the purine nucleotides. Complimentary to these studies, the sequence around the Gx4GKT motif was deleted from a recombinant rat liver beta-subunit overexpressed in E. coli. While the wild type beta-subunit showed specificity for the tri- and diphosphonucleotides, the deletion mutant bound tri-, di-, and monophosphate nucleotides with equal affinity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS);glycine;-;-;LCR_without_function
8371344;Alternative transcriptional initiation as a novel mechanism for regulating expression of a baculovirus trans activator.;In this report, we show that the Orgyia pseudotsugata nuclear polyhedrosis virus p34 gene, which is homologous to the Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus PE-38 gene, is a trans activator. The predicted p34 protein contains a number of motifs that are similar to those found in other eukaryotic transcriptional trans activators, including a putative zinc finger DNA-binding domain, a glutamine-rich domain, and a leucine zipper. Northern (RNA) blot analysis showed that the p34 gene is expressed as a 1.1-kb mRNA from 1 to 48 h postinfection and as a 0.7-kb mRNA from 18 to 120 h postinfection. Mapping of these transcripts showed that they were 3' coterminal but initiated at different 5' start sites. The 1.1-kb transcript initiates at a baculovirus early gene motif (CACAGT) and encodes the entire p34 open reading frame (ORF). The 0.7-kb transcript initiates at a baculovirus late gene start site (GTAAG) internal to the p34 ORF. Western blot (immunoblot) analysis using p34 antisera showed that the 0.7-kb transcript is translated as an amino-terminally truncated 20-kDa form of the full length 34-kDa protein. Functional analysis indicated that the 34-kDa protein transcriptionally trans activates the IE-2 promoter whereas the 20-kDa protein does not. Therefore, p34 produces two functionally different proteins from the same ORF, using the novel mechanism of alternative transcriptional initiation.;glutamine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function

T. pallidum was labeled internally with [35S]methionine and solubilized in 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate-1% Triton X-100.

1722553;Molecular analysis of the responder satellite DNA in Drosophila melanogaster: DNA bending, nucleosome structure, and Rsp-binding proteins.;The Responder (Rsp) locus of Drosophila melanogaster, the target locus of segregation distortion, is a satellite DNA array. This repeat array imparts some fitness advantage to the chromosomes bearing it. In this paper, we report the following three related molecular properties of this satellite repeat: (1) Sequence-directed curvature--On a polyacrylamide gel, Rsp-containing fragments migrate slower than would be predicted on the basis of their physical sizes. The extent of migration retardation correlates with the size and position of the Rsp sequence in a DNA fragment, suggesting that Rsp DNA is bent. The bending is shown to be affected by a DNA-binding drug (Hoechst 33258). (2) Nucleosome structure--Nucleosomes associated with Rsp repeats have an unusual spacing pattern. Instead of being spaced at approximately 190-bp intervals as is the bulk chromatin, they are separated at approximately 240-bp intervals, roughly the size of a dimeric Rsp repeat. The nucleosomal structure in the Rsp region is preferentially disrupted by Hoechst 33258, whereas the bulk chromatin appears to be insensitive to the drug. (3) Rsp-DNA binding proteins--Gel mobility-shift assays using nuclear extracts from pupae and end-labeled Rsp repeat demonstrate the presence of three distinct DNA-protein complexes. Competition assays suggest that these complexes are specific to the Rsp sequence, and two of these nucleoprotein complexes seem to be influenced by the presence of Hoechst 33258. The observed complexes are formed by nonhistone proteins of somatic origin and may be related to the normal functions of Rsp, rather than to the germ-line segregation distortion activities.;-;nucleic acid binding;polyacrylamide;hard_3

Specific islet cell cytoplasmic antibody binding (islet total-exocrine mean integrated absorbance) was dependent on serum dilution and substrate reaction time. The detection limit was approximately 5 JDF units. Specific islet cell cytoplasmic antibody binding values with human and rat pancreas were similar.

The plasmas were fractionated and desalted by Sephadex gel filtration, then subjected to isoelectric focusing in a pH 4 to 6 gradient on 40 X 4 cm slabs of polyacrylamide gel. The gels were cut transversely into 0.5-cm-wide strips, the pH measured, and their angiotensinogen concentrations determined by incubation with excess human renin and radioimmunoassay of the product, angiotensin I. This revealed several peaks of angiotensinogen concentration indicative of microheterogeneity in all cases. Contrary to other claims, the isoelectric pH profiles of angiotensinogens in the various physiological states were substantially alike. Major peaks were found at pH 4.75 to 4.85 and 4.9 to 5.0 and minor peaks at pH 4.5 to 4.7 and 5.0 to 5.2; this resolution was greater than that achieved with rat liver angiotensinogens. Incubation of human angiotensinogens with neuraminidase for 3 or 16 h raised their isoelectric pH by about 0.5 U, probably due to removal of sialic acid. Since microheterogeneity persisted after desialylation, it is probably determined by structural characteristics other than sialic acid composition.";-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1

This study aimed to optimize nanocomposites of 3D PCL scaffolds to provide superior adhesion, proliferation and differentiation environment for BMSCs in this scenario. BMSCs were isolated and cultured in a novel 3D tissue culture poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffold coated with poly-lysine, hydroxyapatite (HAp), collagen and HAp/collagen. Cell morphology was observed and BMSC biomarkers for osteogenesis, osteoblast differentiation and activation were analyzed. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) micrographs showed that coating materials were uniformly deposited on the surface of PCL scaffolds and BMSCs grew and aggregated to form clusters during 3D culture. Both mRNA and protein levels of the key players of osteogenesis and osteoblast differentiation and activation, including runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), alkaline phosphates (ALP), osterix, osteocalcin, and RANKL, were significantly higher in BMSCs seeded in PCL scaffolds coated with HAp or HAp/collagen than those seeded in uncoated PCL scaffolds, whereas the expression levels were not significantly different in collagen or poly-lysine coated PCL scaffolds. In addition, poly-lysine, collagen, HAp/collagen, and HAp coated PCL scaffolds had significantly more viable cells than uncoated PCL scaffolds, especially scaffolds with HAp/collagen and collagen-alone coatings. That BMSCs in HAp or HAp/collagen PCL scaffolds had remarkably higher ALP activities than those in collagen-coated alone or uncoated PCL scaffolds indicating higher osteogenic differentiation levels of BMSCs in HAp or HAp/collagen PCL scaffolds.

10400785;Association with the cellular export receptor CRM 1 mediates function and intracellular localization of Epstein-Barr virus SM protein, a regulator of gene expression.;"Splicing and posttranscriptional processing of eukaryotic gene transcripts are linked to their nuclear export and cytoplasmic expression. Unspliced pre-mRNAs and intronless transcripts are thus inherently poorly expressed. Nevertheless, human and animal viruses encode essential genes as single open reading frames or in the intervening sequences of other genes. Many retroviruses have evolved mechanisms to facilitate nuclear export of their unspliced mRNAs. For example, the human immunodeficiency virus RNA-binding protein Rev associates with the soluble cellular export receptor CRM 1 (exportin 1), which mediates nucleocytoplasmic translocation of Rev-HIV RNA complexes through the nuclear pore. The transforming human herpesvirus Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) expresses a nuclear protein, SM, early in its lytic cycle; SM binds RNA and posttranscriptionally activates expression of certain intronless lytic EBV genes. Here we show that both the trans-activation function and cytoplasmic translocation of SM are dependent on association with CRM 1 in vivo. SM is also shown to be associated in vivo with other components of the CRM 1 export pathway, including the small GTPase Ran and the nucleoporin CAN/Nup214. SM is shown to be present in the cytoplasm, nucleoplasm, and nuclear envelope of transfected cells. Mutation of a leucine-rich region (LRR) of SM inhibited CRM 1-mediated cytoplasmic translocation and SM activity, as did leptomycin B, an inhibitor of CRM 1 complex formation. Surprisingly, however, leptomycin B treatment and mutation of the LRR both led to SM becoming more tightly attached to intranuclear structures. These findings suggest a model in which SM is not merely a soluble carrier protein for RNA but rather is bound directly to intranuclear proteins, possibly including the nuclear pore complex.

6469753;Pharmacology and toxicology of sensitizers: mechanism studies.;Nitroimidazoles are being studied extensively as hypoxic cell radiosensitizers. Besides their ability to selectively sensitize hypoxic cells to radiation, which depends on the parent compound, nitroimidazoles have a variety of other effects in vitro, in vivo and clinically which appear to require reductive metabolism. These other effects include direct cytotoxicity to hypoxic cells, mutagenicity and antimicrobial effects. As a first step to suggesting possible mechanisms for these other biological effects, a summary has been made of the known oxidative and reductive products of the two most widely studied radiosensitizers, metronidazole and misonidazole. Focussing on reductive products, it is clear that a great variety exists which are or may be reactive with biological molecules. Knowledge about the reduction chemistry of nitroimidazoles is new and far from complete. As a second step to suggesting possible mechanisms for these biological effects, it is important to view the problem in terms of the in vivo situation where distribution and sites of metabolism of the drug and its reduction products will be important factors. Variables such as levels of tissue oxygenation and nitroreductase activity will be important to assess. Combining basic information about the reduction chemistry of nitroimidazoles with knowledge about the pharmacology of drugs and their reduced products should allow a better assessment of mechanism of action as well as a better implementation of these drugs clinically.;-;-;-;hard_0
34196488;Chiral V-shaped Pyrenes: Hexagonal Packing, Superhelix, and Amplified Chiroptical Performance.;Here, we designed symmetric and dissymmetric chiral V-shaped pyrenes by linking achiral pyrenes to trans-1,2-cyclohexane diamine scaffolds with varied spacers to investigate their circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized excimer emission (CPEE). In molecular solution, the symmetric V-shaped molecules (P1, P2, P3) displayed spacer-dependent CD and CPEE originating from the intramolecular excimers while the dissymmetric V-shaped B was silent in CD and CPEE. Upon self-assembly, the chiral V-shaped conformation guided a helical hexagonal packing. Notably, P1 self-assembled into delicate superhelices with optimum chiroptical activities and the largest gCD for pyrene derivatives to date. The dissymmetric B formed two distinct hexagonal aggregates as twists and rectangular nanotubes with greatly amplified CPEE. This work demonstrates unprecedented hexagonal superhelices from chiral V-shaped scaffolds and provides a deep insight into the relationship between molecular conformation, supramolecular architectures, and their chiroptical performance.;-;helix;-;hard_2
9314151;Evaluation of fracture predilection in the calcaneus after external fixator pin removal.;"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS
External fixators have been advocated for the treatment of intra-articular fractures of the distal tibia, so-called ""pilon"" or ""plafond"" fractures. Current recommendations include placement of external fixator pins, which vary in diameters up to six millimeters, in the talus and calcaneus. Removal of a relatively large pin may create a large defect in the bone, theoretically increasing fracture predilection with weight bearing. The objective was to compare the compressive load at failure of intact and formerly instrumented calcanei. It was hypothesized that the pin hole defect would not lead to a clinically significant difference in compressive load at failure.


STUDY DESIGN
A biomechanical evaluation of randomized matched pairs of cadaveric calcanei.


METHODS
Fresh human calcanei were harvested, embedded in casting compound, and tested pairwise. Among pairs of calcanei, one served as the control, and the other was drilled with a 6.0-mm pin in the posterior portion. The pin was removed before biomechanical evaluation. Testing was performed in compression under displacement control on a hydraulic materials testing system.


RESULTS
There was a 22% reduction in compressive load at failure (p = 0.021) of the drilled versus intact specimens. Compared with intact calcanei, defect calcanei had a compressive failure load much closer to forces that might be encountered with walking and running.


CONCLUSIONS
The six-millimeter-pin defect is a significant stress riser, and protected, progressive weight bearing after pin removal should be recommended.";-;-;-;hard_0
8142622;"Molecular basis of the t(8;21) translocation in acute myeloid leukaemia.";"The t(8;21) translocation is one of the most frequent chromosomal abnormalities in acute myeloid leukaemia and results in gene fusion between AML1 on chromosome 21 and MTG8 (= ETO or CDR) on chromosome 8. AML1 contains a region of sequence homology to the Drosophila runt gene and the mouse polyomavirus enhancer binding protein PEBP2 alpha gene. The rearrangement occurs within a specific intron of the AML1 gene and results in the formation of a chimaeric protein with the consistent feature that the region of sequence homology of AML1 is fused with almost the entire MTG8 protein. MTG8 (ETO, CDR) is predicted to be a transcription activation factor from its sequence with zinc-finger motifs and proline-rich domains. Thus the rearrangement is a fusion between two probable transcription activation factors.";proline;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
15562316;Secreted Bacterial Effectors and Host-Produced Eiger/TNF Drive Death in aSalmonella-Infected Fruit Fly.;Death by infection is often as much due to the host's reaction as it is to the direct result of microbial action. Here we identify genes in both the host and microbe that are involved in the pathogenesis of infection and disease in Drosophila melanogaster challenged with Salmonella enterica serovartyphimurium (S. typhimurium). We demonstrate that wild-typeS. typhimurium causes a lethal systemic infection when injected into the hemocoel of D. melanogaster. Deletion of the gene encoding the secreted bacterial effect or Salmonella leucine-rich (PslrP)changes an acute and lethal infection to one that is persistent and less deadly. We propose a model in which Salmonella secreted effectors stimulate the fly and thus cause an immune response that is damaging both to the bacteria and, subsequently, to the host. In support of this model, we show that mutations in the fly gene eiger, a TNF homolog, delay the lethality of Salmonella infection. These results suggest that S. typhimurium-infected flies die from a condition that resembles TNF-induced metabolic collapse in vertebrates. This idea provides us with a new model to study shock-like biology in a genetically manipulable host. In addition, it allows us to study the difference in pathways followed by a microbe when producing an acute or persistent infection.;leucine;-;-;LCR_without_function

The role of SePP in sepsis is incompletely characterized. To test the hypothesis that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) interacts with SePP, we investigated the interaction between LPS and the histidine-rich (His-rich) regions of SePP. We demonstrate that both purified SePP and synthetic peptides corresponding to the His-rich motifs neutralized LPS. In addition, we used a hepatocyte model to study the fate of SePP in response to LPS or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.

27624998;Contamination-controlled high-throughput whole genome sequencing for influenza A viruses using the MiSeq sequencer.;Accurate full-length genomic sequences are important for viral phylogenetic studies. We developed a targeted high-throughput whole genome sequencing (HT-WGS) method for influenza A viruses, which utilized an enzymatic cleavage-based approach, the Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit, for library preparation. The entire library preparation workflow was adapted for the Sentosa SX101, a liquid handling platform, to automate this labor-intensive step. As the enzymatic cleavage-based approach generates low coverage reads at both ends of the cleaved products, we corrected this loss of sequencing coverage at the termini by introducing modified primers during the targeted amplification step to generate full-length influenza A sequences with even coverage across the whole genome. Another challenge of targeted HTS is the risk of specimen-to-specimen cross-contamination during the library preparation step that results in the calling of false-positive minority variants. We included an in-run, negative system control to capture contamination reads that may be generated during the liquid handling procedures. The upper limits of 99.99% prediction intervals of the contamination rate were adopted as cut-off values of contamination reads. Here, 148 influenza A/H3N2 samples were sequenced using the HTS protocol and were compared against a Sanger-based sequencing method. Our data showed that the rate of specimen-to-specimen cross-contamination was highly significant in HTS.;-;-;-;hard_0
9338929;Do minocycline and other tetracyclines have a place in rheumatology?;Tetracyclines are a family of antimicrobials with activity against a broad range of organisms including those that develop intracellularly. Links have been reported between some infections and some inflammatory joint diseases, with the most notable example involving mycoplasmas and rheumatoid arthritis. Reactive arthritides are known to be triggered by organisms found in the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract, and antigenic material from these organisms has recently been demonstrated in synovial tissue from patients with reactive arthritis. These facts led to the hypothesis that tetracyclines may be useful in rheumatoid arthritis and reactive arthritis. Two controlled studies found that minocycline benefited rheumatoid arthritis patients when it was given either as an adjunct to another second-line treatment or as the only slow-acting drug. Lymecycline has been found to expedite recovery from reactive arthritis due to Chlamydia trachomatis, and tetracycline to decrease the incidence of reactive arthritis due to sexually-transmitted diseases. The safety profiles of these treatments were acceptable in all available studies but require further investigation during long-term administration. The benefits may be related to the immunomodulating effects of tetracyclines and/or to their ability to inhibit metalloproteases such as collagenases. Whether tetracycline therapy influences the course of radiologic lesions in rheumatoid arthritis remains unknown. However, minocycline therapy has given sufficient proof of its efficacy to make it an attractive alternative in rheumatoid arthritis.;-;antigen;-;hard_2

15453096;Role of Ang1 and its interaction with VEGF-A in astrocytomas.;Angiopoietins (Ang1 and Ang2) modulate the activity of the endothelial cell (EC)-specific receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2, which together with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) and its EC-specific receptors, VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, regulate normal physiological vessel development. The functional role of angiopoietins in tumor angiogenesis, in particular astrocytoma angiogenesis, remains unclear. In this study, we focus on the specific contribution of Ang1 to the vascular growth of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and its interactive role with VEGF-A. Subcutaneous and intracranial GBM xenografts were generated using 3 established astrocytoma cell lines (U87, U373, and U343) that were transfected to stably over-express Ang1. GBM xenografts were also generated to express low levels of VEGF-A and high Angl. We found that Ang1 increases the vascular growth of both subcutaneous and intracranial xenografts of GBM by approximately 3-fold. However, the increased vascular growth was only seen in xenografts with concurrent VEGF-A elevation, since decreasing VEGF-A expression resulted in a loss of the pro-angiogenic growth advantage seen with Ang1. Collectively, our data suggest that Ang1 regulates GBM vascularity in a VEGF-A dependent manner, synergizing the initial pro-angiogenic response that is triggered by VEGF-A and promoting the vascular growth of GBM.;-;-;-;hard_0
22091396;The Role of Protein Arginine Methylation in mRNP Dynamics.;In eukaryotes, messenger RNA biogenesis depends on the ordered and precise assembly of a nuclear messenger ribonucleoprotein particle (mRNP) during transcription. This process requires a well-orchestrated and dynamic sequence of molecular recognition events by specific RNA-binding proteins. Arginine methylation is a posttranslational modification found in a plethora of RNA-binding proteins responsible for mRNP biogenesis. These RNA-binding proteins include both heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) and serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins. In this paper, I discuss the mechanisms of action by which arginine methylation modulates various facets of mRNP biogenesis, and how the collective consequences of this modification impart the specificity required to generate a mature, translational- and export-competent mRNP. ;arginine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
14757213;Phylogenetic conservation of a snake venom metalloproteinase epitope recognized by a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes hemorrhagic activity.;Snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) are present in large quantities in venoms of viper snakes and also in some elapids. Jararhagin is a representative of a P-III multidomain hemorrhagic SVMP present in Bothrops jararaca venom. It is comprised of a catalytic, a disintegrin-like and a cysteine-rich domain. Seven anti-jararhagin monoclonal antibodies (MAJar 1-7) were produced, of which six reacted with the disintegrin domain. MAJar 3 recognized an epitope present at the C-terminal part of the disintegrin-like domain, and neutralized jararhagin-induced hemorrhage. In this study, we evaluated the reactivity of these monoclonal antibodies with venoms from 27 species of snakes belonging to different families. MAJar 3 recognized most of the hemorrhagic venoms. By ELISA, MAJar 3 reacted strongly with venoms from Viperidae family and weakly with Colubridae and Elapidae venoms. This recognition pattern was due to bands between 50 and 80 kDa, corresponding to P-III SVMPs. This antibody preferentially neutralized the hemorrhage induced by venoms of Bothrops snakes. This fact suggests that the epitope recognized by MAJar 3 is present in other metalloproteinases throughout snake phylogeny. However, slight structural differences in the epitope may result in insufficient affinity for neutralization of biological activities.;cysteine;-;-;LCR_without_function
21038390;Circular dichroism eigenspectra of polyproline II and β-strand conformers of trialanine in water: Singular value decomposition analysis.;Despite that a number of experimental and theoretical investigations have been carried out to determine the structure of trialanine in water, the reported populations of polyproline II (PPII) and β-strand conformers vary and were found to be dependent on which spectroscopic method was used. Such discrepancies are due to limitations of different spectroscopic methods used. Here, the temperature- and pH-dependent circular dichroism (CD) and NMR experiments have been carried out to develop a self-consistent singular value decomposition procedure. The temperature-dependent CD spectra indicate the presence of two conformers, but due to the two peptide bonds in a trialanine, one should take into consideration of four different conformers to fully interpret the NMR results. From the pH-dependent NMR coupling constant measurements, the conformation of zwitterionic trialanine is little different from that of cationic one. The strong pH dependency of CD spectrum is likely due to charge transfer transitions between carboxylate and nearby peptide groups or internal field effects not to pH-dependent conformational change. To simultaneously analyze the temperature-dependent CD and NMR data, a self-consistent procedure was used to newly determine the reference NMR coupling constants required to estimate one of the peptide dihedral angles. From the estimated enthalpy and entropy changes associated with the transition from enthalpically favorable PPII conformer to entropically favorable β-strand conformer, the relative populations of the four possible conformers of trialanine were determined and compared with the previous experimental findings. We anticipate that the present experimental results and interpretation procedure would be of use in determining the solution structures of small oligopeptides in the future.;proline;-;-;LCR_without_function
1635026;Separation and characterization of adult worm proteins and glycoproteins from the liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini.;Detailed studies of liver fluke proteins and antigens are necessary to facilitate further investigation of the human immune responses to these parasites. Accordingly, Opisthorchis viverrini antigens were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting. We initially encountered excessive background smearing, vertical streaking, and indistinct bands that were similar to problems previously described by investigators studying this and other trematodes including Schistosoma mansoni. These problems were especially evident with silver staining of proteins and occurred despite the extensive use of protease inhibitors. They were minimized by using mini (vs. large) SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue protein staining. With the latter 2 techniques, adult worm somatic proteins and excretory-secretory products were separated and characterized. Immunoblots using rabbit anti-adult worm sera demonstrated that some of these proteins were antigens common to both the adult and metacercarial stages. Several of these antigens also corresponded (according to molecular weight) to glycoproteins, detected by concanavalin A blotting. These findings form a base for subsequent studies of the human immune response to liver fluke infection.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3

We have cloned and sequenced exd: it encodes a homeodomain protein with extensive identity (71%) to the human proto-oncoprotein Pbx1. exd is expressed during embryogenesis when the selector homeodomain proteins of the Antennapedia and bithorax complexes establish segmental identity. Maternally expressed exd is uniform and can suppress the segmental transformations of embryos lacking zygotic exd. While zygotic exd expression is also at first uniform, later expression is modulated by the homeotic selector genes. These studies support the view that exd acts with the selector homeodomain proteins as a DNA-binding transcription factor, thereby altering their regulation of downstream target genes.;-;transcription factor;-;hard_2
9417097;Protein kinase D activation by mutations within its pleckstrin homology domain.;Protein kinase D (PKD) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that contains a cysteine-rich repeat sequence homologous to that seen in the regulatory domain of protein kinase C (PKC) and a catalytic domain with only a low degree of sequence similarity to PKCs. PKD also contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain inserted between the cysteine-rich motifs and the catalytic domain that is not present in any of the PKCs. To investigate the function of the PH domain in the regulation of PKD activity, we determined the kinase activity of several PKD PH domain mutants immunoprecipitated from lysates of transiently transfected COS-7 cells. Deletion of the entire PH domain (amino acids 429-557) markedly increased the basal activity of the enzyme as assessed by autophosphorylation ( approximately 16-fold) and exogenous syntide-2 peptide substrate phosphorylation assays (approximately 12-fold). Mutant PKD proteins with partial deletions or single amino acid substitutions within the PH domain (e. g. R447C and W538A) also exhibited increased basal kinase activity. These constitutive active mutants of PKD were only slightly further stimulated by phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate treatment of intact cells.

1635559;Synthesis and secretion of a functional antibody in a vaccinia virus expression system.;A humanized rat monoclonal antibody (Campath 1H) has been expressed in HeLa cells using recombinant vaccinia viruses. Heavy and light chain recombinant viruses were constructed separately and when grown independently produced proteins of the expected molecular weights. Expressed heavy chain was entirely intracellular but light chain was mainly excreted and processed. When cells were infected at high multiplicity with both heavy and light chain recombinants a proportion of the heavy chain was then found in the extracellular medium. This secreted heavy chain was shown to be associated with light chain as judged by co-electrophoresis in non-reducing SDS polyacrylamide gels and by co-purification on protein-A sepharose. The secreted heavy and light chain complexes were functionally active as an antibody, with activity comparable to authentic Campath 1H antibody as assessed by ELISA, T-cell binding and antigen binding assays. Production of antibody in this system was achieved in the absence of serum, which is an important consideration in the production of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). The amount of antibody produced was 0.2-0.4 micrograms/10(6) cells without optimization of expression levels.

2188110;Sequence and functional analysis of the positively acting regulatory gene amdR from Aspergillus nidulans.;"The positively acting regulatory gene amdR of Aspergillus nidulans coordinately regulates the expression of five structural genes involved in the catabolism of certain amides (amdS), omega amino acids (gatA and gabA), and lactams (lamA and lamB) in the presence of omega amino acid inducers. Analysis of the amdR gene showed that it contains three small introns, heterogeneous 5' and 3' transcription sites, and multiple AUG codons prior to the major AUG initiator. The predicted amdR protein sequence has a cysteine-rich ""zinc finger"" DNA-binding motif at the amino-terminal end, four putative acidic transcription activation motifs in the carboxyl-terminal half, and two sequences homologous to the simian virus 40 large T antigen nuclear localization motif. These nuclear localization sequences overlap the cysteine-rich DNA-binding motif. A series of 5', 3', and internal deletions were examined in vivo for transcription activator function and showed that the amdR product contains at least two activation regions in the carboxyl-terminal half. Each of these activator amdR product contains at least two activation regions in the carboxyl-terminal half. Each of these activator regions may function independently, but both are required for wild-type levels of transcription activation. A number of the amdR deletion products were found to compete with the wild-type amdR product in vivo. Development of a rapid method for the localization of amdR mutations is presented, and using this technique, we localized and sequenced the mutation in the semiconstitutive amdR6c allele. The amdR6c missense mutation occurs in the middle of the gene, and it is suggested that it results in an altered protein which activates gene expression efficiently in the absence of an inducer.

Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified dA/dT sequence-binding protein in the presence of NaDodSO4 showed a single protein band of 62 kDa. Nitrocellulose filter binding assays using homopolydeoxynucleotides indicated that the purified protein preferentially binds to dA/dT sequences in single-stranded or duplex DNAs. Gel mobility shift assays with a variety of DNAs showed that the purified protein specifically binds to a fragment of simian virus 40 DNA containing the minimal (core) origin for replication. The binding occurred in a protein-dependent manner and in the presence of a vast excess of competing DNAs lacking the simian virus replication origin. The origin binding was reduced, however, when DNA fragments from simian virus 40 deletion mutants containing deletions within the 17-base-pair A + T-rich tract in the core DNA replication origin were used in the assays. These results indicate that the dA/dT sequence-binding protein preferentially binds to the 17-base-pair A + T-rich tract and suggest a possible role for the protein in the initiation of DNA replication. ;threonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
2759716;Dendritic cell accumulation in draining lymph nodes during the induction phase of contact allergy in mice.;Draining lymph node cells isolated from mice 24 h following topical exposure to a variety of contact-sensitizing chemicals, including the dinitrobenzene derivatives, 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene and 2,4-dinitrothiocyanobenzene, contained increased numbers of dendritic cells (DCs). The increase in frequency of DCs was time-dependent and preceded significant changes in either lymph node cellularity or lymph node cell proliferative activity. The degree of DC accumulation was also influenced by the chemical used and the concentration employed for sensitization. In the context of contact allergy, the biological relevance of this phenomenon to the induction of hapten-specific responses is indicated by the fact that relatively small numbers of DC--enriched fractions of lymph node cells (comprising approximately 70% DCs), but not unfractionated or DC--depleted populations, transferred sensitization to naive animals.

14734537;Atypical protein kinase C (PKCzeta/lambda) is a convergent downstream target of the insulin-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and TC10 signaling pathways.;Insulin stimulation of adipocytes resulted in the recruitment of atypical PKC (PKCzeta/lambda) to plasma membrane lipid raft microdomains. This redistribution of PKCzeta/lambda was prevented by Clostridium difficile toxin B and by cholesterol depletion, but was unaffected by inhibition of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activity. Expression of the constitutively active GTP-bound form of TC10 (TC10Q/75L), but not the inactive GDP-bound mutant (TC10/T31N), targeted PKCzeta/lambda to the plasma membrane through an indirect association with the Par6-Par3 protein complex. In parallel, insulin stimulation as well as TC10/Q75L resulted in the activation loop phosphorylation of PKCzeta. Although PI 3-kinase activation also resulted in PKCzeta/lambda phosphorylation, it was not recruited to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, insulin-induced GSK-3beta phosphorylation was mediated by both PI 3-kinase-PKB and the TC10-Par6-atypical PKC signaling pathways. Together, these data demonstrate that PKCzeta/lambda can serve as a convergent downstream target for both the PI 3-kinase and TC10 signaling pathways, but only the TC10 pathway induces a spatially restricted targeting to the plasma membrane.;-;kinase activity;-;hard_2
30071380;Dendritic cell-mediated delivery of doxorubicin-polyglycerol-nanodiamond composites elicits enhanced anti-cancer immune response in glioblastoma.;Glioblastoma (GBM) is the deadliest and most common type of primary brain tumor in adults with a grim prognosis despite multimodal treatments. Dendritic cell (DC)-based immunotherapy has emerged as a promising therapeutic modality for GBM, whose efficacy is nonetheless fundamentally undermined by GBM-induced immunosuppression. Inducing emission of damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) is a highly effective strategy to subvert tumor-associated immunosuppression. The present work was carried out to explore the idea of subverting the GBM immunosuppressive microenvironment through DC-mediated delivery of doxorubicin-polyglycerol-nanodiamond composites (Nano-DOX), a potent DAMPs inducer demonstrated by our previous study, and thereby eliciting enhanced DC-driven anti-GBM immune response. In the in-vitro work on human cell models, Nano-DOX-loaded DC were shown to be functionally viable and release cargo drug to co-cultured GBM cells (GC). Nano-DOX-treated GC displayed not only profuse DAMPs emission but also antigen release. Enhanced activation and acquisition and presentation of GC-derived antigen were then demonstrated in DC in co-culture with GC and Nano-DOX. Consistently, co-culture with GC and Nano-DOX also activated mouse bone marrow-derived DC (mDC) which in turn stimulated mouse spleen-derived lymphocytes which ultimately suppressed co-cultured GC. Next, athymic mice bearing orthotopic human GBM xenografts were intravenously injected with Nano-DOX-loaded mDC and, 48 h later, spleen-derived lymphocytes. The presence of Nano-DOX, DAMPs emission and enhanced infiltration and activation of mDC and lymphocytes were detected in the GBM xenografts. Taken together, our results demonstrate the efficacy of DC-mediated delivery of Nano-DOX to stimulate GC immunogenicity and elicit anti-cancer immune response in the GBM. By this work, we present a novel approach with great application potential to subverting the GBM immunosuppressive microenvironment and to anti-GBM immunotherapy. Investigation has also been conducted probing the mechanisms by which Nano-DOX stimulates GC immunogenicity, which is described in a follow-up paper.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
36265582;Accessing isotopically labeled proteins containing genetically encoded phosphoserine for NMR with optimized expression conditions.;Phosphoserine (pSer) sites are primarily located within disordered protein regions, making it difficult to experimentally ascertain their effects on protein structure and function. Therefore, the production of 15N- (and 13C)-labeled proteins with site-specifically encoded pSer for NMR studies is essential to uncover molecular mechanisms of protein regulation by phosphorylation. While genetic code expansion technologies for the translational installation of pSer in Escherichia coli are well established and offer a powerful strategy to produce site-specifically phosphorylated proteins, methodologies to adapt them to minimal or isotope-enriched media have not been described. This shortcoming exists because pSer genetic code expansion expression hosts require the genomic ΔserB mutation, which increases pSer bioavailability but also imposes serine auxotrophy, preventing growth in minimal media used for isotopic labeling of recombinant proteins. Here, by testing different media supplements, we restored normal BL21(DE3) ΔserB growth in labeling media but subsequently observed an increase of phosphatase activity and mis-incorporation not typically seen in standard rich media. After rounds of optimization and adaption of a high-density culture protocol, we were able to obtain ≥10 mg/L homogenously labeled, phosphorylated superfolder GFP. To demonstrate the utility of this method, we also produced the intrinsically disordered serine/arginine-rich region of the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein labeled with 15N and pSer at the key site S188 and observed the resulting peak shift due to phosphorylation by 2D and 3D heteronuclear single quantum correlation analyses. We propose this cost-effective methodology will pave the way for more routine access to pSer-enriched proteins for 2D and 3D NMR analyses.;arginine;phosphatase activity;-;LCR_with_function
9354618;Tertiary and quaternary structures of 0.19 alpha-amylase inhibitor from wheat kernel determined by X-ray analysis at 2.06 A resolution.;The crystal structure of 0.19 alpha-amylase inhibitor (0.19 AI) from wheat kernel was determined by the multiple-isomorphous replacement method coupled with density modification and noncrystallographic symmetry averaging and then refined by simulated annealing using diffraction data to 2.06 A resolution (R = 18.7%, free R = 22.3%). The asymmetric unit has four molecules of 0.19 AI, each comprised of 124 amino acid residues. Electron density for residues 1-4 and 69-77 is absent in all subunits, probably because of the intrinsic flexibility of these segments. Each subunit has four major alpha-helices and one one-turn helix which are arranged in the up-and-down manner, maintaining the favorable packing modes of the alpha-helices. 0.19 AI, however, has two short antiparallel beta-strands. All 10 cysteine residues in 0.19 AI form disulfide bonds (C6-C52, C20-C41, C28-C83, C42-C99, and C54-C115), consistent with the assignments made biochemically for 0.28 AI from wheat kernel and by NMR analysis of the bifunctional alpha-amylase/trypsin inhibitor from ragi seeds (RBI). The disulfide bond patterns in these AIs are similar to those in the hydrophobic protein from soybean (HPS), which lack only the bond corresponding to C28-C83 in 0.19 AI. Extensive interactions occurred between particular pairs of 0.19 AI subunits, mainly involving hydrophobic residues. Comparisons of the structures of 0.19 AI, RBI, and HPS showed that the arrangements of the major alpha-helices are similar but the conformations of the remaining residues differ markedly. The present X-ray analysis for 0.19 AI and the NMR analysis for RBI suggest that all the AIs in this family have a common fold. The alpha-amylase binding site is discussed on the basis of the tertiary and quaternary structures of 0.19 AI together with biochemical and spectroscopic data for AIs.;-;helix;-;hard_2
8645222;Transforming growth factor-beta type-II receptor signalling: intrinsic/associated casein kinase activity, receptor interactions and functional effects of blocking antibodies.;The transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) family of growth factors control proliferation, extracellular matrix synthesis and/ or differentiation in a wide variety of cells. However, the molecular mechanisms governing ligand binding, receptor oligomerization and signal transduction remain incompletely understood. In this study, we utilized a set of antibodies selective for the extracellular and intracellular domains of the TGF-beta type-II receptor as probes to investigate the intrinsic kinase activity of this receptor and its physical association in multimeric complexes with type-I and type-III receptors. The type-II receptor immuno-precipitated from human osteosarcoma cells exhibited autophosphorylation and casein kinase activity that was markedly stimulated by polylysine yet was insensitive to heparin. Affinity cross-linking of 125I-TGF-beta 1 ligand to cellular receptors followed by specific immunoprecipitation demonstrated that type-II receptors form stable complexes with both type-I and type-III receptors expressed on the surfaces of both human osteosarcoma cells and rabbit chondrocytes. Pretreatment of the cultured cells with an antibody directed against a distinct extracellular segment of the type-II receptor (anti-TGF-beta-IIR-NT) effectively blocked the 125I-TGF-beta labelling of type-I receptors without preventing the affinity labelling of type-II or type-III receptors, indicating a selective disruption of the type-I/type-II hetero-oligomers. The anti-TGF-beta-IIR-NT antibodies also blocked the TGF-beta-dependent induction of the plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) promoter observed in mink lung epithelial cells. However, the same anti-TGF-beta-IIR-NT antibodies did not prevent the characteristic inhibition of cellular proliferation by TGF-beta 1, as determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. The selective perturbation of PAI-1 promoter induction versus cell-cycle-negative regulation suggests that strategic disruption of TGF-beta type-I and -II receptor interactions can effectively alter specific cellular responses to TGF-beta signalling. ;lysine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
1436339;Fibrinolytic capacity in hemodialysis patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.;A major adverse effect of recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) in hemodialyzed patients are thrombotic events. Several reports on platelet function during r-HuEPO treatment have been published but less is known about fibrinolysis. In the present study, the fibrinolytic capacity was studied in 20 patients on maintenance hemodialysis and treated with r-HuEPO. The patients were randomized into two groups and investigated in a crossover design. r-HuEPO was administered intravenously and subcutaneously in each group and was given for 3 months, respectively. Plasma tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and released t-PA remained unaffected by r-HuEPO in both groups throughout the study. Tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) increased in a cyclic way reaching peak values 4-6 weeks after the start of investigation and again 4-6 weeks after changing therapy. The increase in PAI was significant in the two groups (0.025 > p > 0.01). Tissue plasminogen antigen was low in the uremic patients. The influence of r-HuEPO on this parameter was not investigated. Compensatory changes in plasma levels of factor XII procoagulant activity, activated protein C and of alpha 2-antiplasmin were not observed. Thrombotic events occurred in 4 patients at peak values of PAI. Six patients required an increase in heparin dose simultaneously with the increase in PAI. Thus, r-HuEPO seemed to affect the fibrinolytic capacity of uremic patients.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
2426185;Influenza nucleoprotein-specific cytotoxic T-cell clones are protective in vivo.;Influenza nucleoprotein (NP) serves as a target antigen on abortively infected cells for cytotoxic T cells (Tc) cross-reactive for all type A influenza viruses, and it can also prime mice for such Tc. It is important to test the protective ability of NP-specific Tc clones in vivo in a productive influenza infection. In this report, we show that Tc clones of this antigenic specificity protect mice against a lethal influenza infection on transfer to syngeneic recipients, and also that they reduce virus titres in the lungs and trachea of mice challenged with homologous or heterologous type A influenza viruses. Simultaneous injection of IL-2 to maintain the viability of the Tc clones is not essential, but has made the clonal transfer experiments highly reproducible.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
7750790;Inhibition by activated neutrophils of the Ca2+ pump ATPase of intact red blood cells.;Human neutrophils, activated by phorbol myristate acetate in the presence of intact red blood cells (RBCs), caused inhibition of the Ca2+ pump ATPase of the RBCs and fragmentation of the enzyme as well as other membrane proteins. Inhibition of the Ca2+ pump ATPase of intact RBCs was directly related to the neutrophil concentration and the time of incubation. Ca2+ pump ATPase activity was partially protected by the addition of exogenous glutathione-glutathione peroxidase, but not by superoxide dismutase. The addition of sodium azide, a potent inhibitor of endogenous RBC catalase, enhanced inhibition of the Ca2+ pump ATPase of intact RBCs. Examination by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of membrane proteins isolated from RBCs preincubated with activated neutrophils showed gross changes in banding patterns as compared to controls. Thus, a significant amount of methemoglobin appeared to be associated with the membrane proteins, and, in general, protein bands appeared to be more diffuse and less defined than proteins in control lanes. In addition, there was an increase in the low molecular weight protein bands. Using a monoclonal antibody to the Ca2+ pump ATPase, it was shown that the 140 kDa band representing the Ca2+ pump ATPase decreased, with concomitant appearance of two low molecular weight bands running at 8.2 and 6.8 kDa in the membrane proteins from RBCs preincubated with activated neutrophils. The data are interpreted to suggest that inhibition of the Ca2+ pump ATPase in intact RBCs under these conditions occurred as a result of: neutrophil-derived superoxide, dismutation of superoxide, to H2O2, diffusion of H2O2 into RBCs, a Fenton type reaction between oxyhemoglobin, and H2O2 producing hydroxyl radical and/or a ferryl radical capable of promoting protein fragmentation of RBC membrane proteins, including the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump ATPase.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
1741247;Molecular and functional analysis of the XPBC/ERCC-3 promoter: transcription activity is dependent on the integrity of an Sp1-binding site.;The human XPBC/ERCC-3 gene, which corrects the excision-repair defect in xeroderma pigmentosum group B cells and the UV-sensitive CHO mutant 27-1 cells, appears to be expressed constitutively in various cell types and tissues. We have analysed the structure and functionality of the XPBC/ERCC-3 promoter. Transcription of the XPBC/ERCC-3 gene is initiated from heterogeneous sites, with a major startpoint mapped at position -54 (relative to the translation start codon ATG). The promoter region does not possess classical TATA and CAAT elements, but it is GC-rich and contains three putative Sp1-binding sites. In addition, there are two elements related to the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-response element (CRE) and the 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate-response element (TRE) in the 5'-flanking region. Transient expression analysis of XPBC/ERCC-3 promoter-CAT chimeric plasmids revealed that a 127-bp fragment, spanning position -129 to -3, is minimally required for the promoter activity. Transcription of the XPBC/ERCC-3 promoter depends on the integrity of a putative Sp1-binding site in close proximity to the major cap site. Band shift assays showed that this putative Sp1-binding site can interact specifically with a nuclear factor, most likely transcription factor Sp1 (or an Sp1-like factor) in vitro.;cysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
7852577;Comparison of Chlamydia pneumoniae isolates by western blot (immunoblot) analysis and DNA sequencing of the omp 2 gene.;The 60-kDa cysteine-rich outer membrane protein gene (omp 2) from nine Chlamydia pneumoniae isolates (TW-183, CM-1, CWL-050, CWL-011, IOL-207, FIL, Kajaani-6, Helsinki-12, and Parjaanonen) was amplified by PCR and sequenced from positions 1 to 580. In contrast to the sequence differences previously observed in this gene in other chlamydial species, all nine C. pneumoniae isolates were 100% identical. However, when sera from C. pneumoniae microimmunofluorescence-positive patients (with clinical signs of persistent cough or asthma) were immunoblotted against five C. pneumoniae isolates, distinct antigenic differences were observed. TW-183 was characterized by major bands at 35 and 43 kDa. In contrast, the other four isolates tested produced similar, though not identical, immunoblot profiles, characterized by strong bands at 18, 25, 29, 40, 46, and 53 kDa. These data support the fact that significant differences do exist between C. pneumoniae isolates, but unlike the case with other chlamydial species, these differences do not reside in either of the commonly studied outer membrane protein genes, omp 1 or omp 2.;cysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

9721093;Ocean climate change: comparison of acoustic tomography, satellite altimetry, and modeling;"Comparisons of gyre-scale acoustic and direct thermal measurements of heat content in the Pacific Ocean, satellite altimeter measurements of sea surface height, and results from a general circulation model show that only about half of the seasonal and year-to-year changes in sea level are attributable to thermal expansion. Interpreting climate change signals from fluctuations in sea level is therefore complicated. The annual cycle of heat flux is 150 +/- 25 watts per square meter (peak-to-peak, corresponding to a 0.2 degreesC vertically averaged temperature cycle); an interannual change of similar magnitude is also detected. Meteorological estimates of surface heat flux, if accurate, require a large seasonal cycle in the advective heat flux.";-;-;-;hard_0
3009861;Palindromic structure and polypeptide expression of 36 kilobase pairs of heterogeneous Epstein-Barr virus (P3HR-1) DNA.;Among the Epstein-Barr virions (EBV) produced by the P3HR-1 (HR-1) cell line are a defective subpopulation with rearranged viral DNA designated heterogeneous DNA (het DNA). These defective virions are responsible for the capacity of HR-1 virus to induce early antigen in Raji c cells and for trans activation of latent EBV in X50-7 cells. Virions with het DNA are independent replicons which pass horizontally from cell to cell rather than being partitioned vertically. We analyzed the structure and defined several polypeptide products of het DNA to understand these remarkable biologic properties. A 36-kilobase-pair (kbp) stretch of het DNA was cloned (as two EcoRI fragments of 20 and 16 kbp) from virions released from a cellular subclone of HR-1 cells. The unusual aspect of the 20-kbp fragment was the linkage of sequences of BamHI-M and BamHI-B', which are not adjacent on the standard EBV genome. The 16-kbp fragment was a palindrome in which at least two additional recombinations on each side of the palindrome had linked regions of the standard EBV genome which are not normally contiguous. The 20-kbp het DNA fragment was attached to at least one and possibly both ends of the 16-kbp het DNA fragment. We identified antigenic polypeptides produced in COS-1 cells after gene transfer of various cloned het DNA fragments. The 20-kbp fragment encoded a cytoplasmic antigen of about 95 kilodaltons (kDa). The 16-kbp fragment encoded antigens located in the nucleus, nuclear membrane, and cytoplasm. These were represented by several polypeptides, the most prominent of which were about 55, 52, and 36 kDa. The 36-kDa polypeptide was localized to a 2.7-kbp BamHI fragment which had homology to standard BamHI-W and BamHI-Z. Another polypeptide of 50 kDa found in the nucleus was mapped to the 7.1-kbp BamHI het DNA fragment which spans the EcoRI site linking the 20- and 16-kbp fragments of het DNA. Thus, HR-1 het DNA encodes several discrete polypeptide products, one or more of which could be responsible for the unusual biologic properties of the virus. The composition, regulation, and ultimately the expression of some of these products relative to standard EBV is probably altered by the genomic rearrangements of het DNA.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
25437750;Long Non-Coding RNA NEAT1 Associates with SRp40 to Temporally Regulate PPARγ2 Splicing during Adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 Cells.;Long non-coding (lnc) RNAs serve a multitude of functions in cells. NEAT1 RNA is a highly abundant 4 kb lncRNA in nuclei, and coincides with paraspeckles, nuclear domains that control sequestration of paraspeckle proteins. We examined NEAT1 RNA levels and its function in 3T3-L1 cells during differentiation to adipocytes. Levels of NEAT1 transcript, measured by RT-PCR, fluctuated in a temporal manner over the course of differentiation that suggested its role in alternative splicing of PPARγ mRNA, the major transcription factor driving adipogenesis. When cells were induced to differentiate by a media cocktail of insulin, dexamethasone, and isobutylmethyxanthine (IBMX) on Day 0, NEAT1 levels dropped on Day 4, when the PPARγ2 variant was spliced and when terminal differentiation occurs The appearance of PPARγ2 coordinates with the PPARγ1 variant to drive differentiation of adipocytes. SiRNA used to deplete NEAT1 resulted in the inability of cells to phosphorylate the serine/arginine-rich splicing protein, SRp40. SiRNA treatment for SRp40 resulted in dysregulation of PPARγ1 and, primarily, PPARγ2 mRNA levels. SRp40 associated with NEAT1, as shown by RNA-IP on days 0 and 8, but decreased on day 4, and concentrations increased over that of IgG control. Overexpression of SRp40 increased PPARγ2, but not γ1. Although lncRNA MALAT1 has been investigated in SR protein function, NEAT1 has not been shown to bind SR proteins for phosphorylation such that alternative splicing results. The ability of cells to increase phosphorylated SR proteins for PPARγ2 splicing suggests that fluxes in NEAT1 levels during adipogenesis regulate alternative splicing events.  ;arginine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
25972551;Comparable Antigenicity and Immunogenicity of Oligomeric Forms of a Novel, Acute HIV-1 Subtype C gp145 Envelope for Use in Preclinical and Clinical Vaccine Research.;"Eliciting broadly reactive functional antibodies remains a challenge in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vaccine development that is complicated by variations in envelope (Env) subtype and structure. The majority of new global HIV-1 infections are subtype C, and novel antigenic properties have been described for subtype C Env proteins. Thus, an HIV-1 subtype C Env protein (CO6980v0c22) from an infected person in the acute phase (Fiebig stage I/II) was developed as a research reagent and candidate immunogen. The gp145 envelope is a novel immunogen with a fully intact membrane-proximal external region (MPER), extended by a polylysine tail. Soluble gp145 was enriched for trimers that yielded the expected ""fan blade"" motifs when visualized by cryoelectron microscopy. CO6980v0c22 gp145 reacts with the 4E10, PG9, PG16, and VRC01 HIV-1 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), as well as the V1/V2-specific PGT121, 697, 2158, and 2297 MAbs. Different gp145 oligomers were tested for immunogenicity in rabbits, and purified dimers, trimers, and larger multimers elicited similar levels of cross-subtype binding and neutralizing antibodies to tier 1 and some tier 2 viruses. Immunized rabbit sera did not neutralize the highly resistant CO6980v0c22 pseudovirus but did inhibit the homologous infectious molecular clone in a peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) assay. This Env is currently in good manufacturing practice (GMP) production to be made available for use as a clinical research tool and further evaluation as a candidate vaccine. At present, the product pipeline for HIV vaccines is insufficient and is limited by inadequate capacity to produce large quantities of vaccine to standards required for human clinical trials. Such products are required to evaluate critical questions of vaccine formulation, route, dosing, and schedule, as well as to establish vaccine efficacy. The gp145 Env protein presented in this study forms physical trimers, binds to many of the well-characterized broad neutralizing MAbs that target conserved Env epitopes, and induce cross-subtype neutralizing antibodies as measured in both cell line and primary cell assays. This subtype C Env gp145 protein is currently undergoing good manufacturing practice production for use as a reagent for preclinical studies and for human clinical research. This product will serve as a reagent for comparative studies and may represent a next-generation candidate HIV immunogen. ";lysine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
504074;Zone precipitation chromatography: its use in the isolation of different collagen types.;Zone Precipitation Chromatography is a useful technique for the initial isolation of the different collagen types in their native configuration. Small quantities of collagen mixtures can be rapidly separated into different collagen types with a relatively high degree of purity, based upon stained protein patterns on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) slab gels. In the commonly used bulk salt preparative method for isolating the different collagens, 50 mg of starting material was needed. Three days were required to complete the procedure. The stained protein patterns on SDS-PAGE slab gels showed about 25% contamination with the bulk purified Type III fraction and 20% contamination with the bulk purified type AB collagen. With Zone Precipitation Chromatography 5 mg of starting material was used and in less than 4 hours the mixture was separated with Types III and AB fractions showing less than 10% contamination from other collagen types. The technique is patterned after the Zone Precipitation method reported by Porath seventeen years ago and utilizes a step-wise sodium chloride gradient to precipitate and redissolve the collagens, eluting from the interbead spaces of a molecular sieve column.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1

On the basis of low values for circulating iodothyronines, hypothyroidism was suspected in 3 dogs in the pyoderma group.

A 20-year retrospective review from two trauma centers of survival outcome for patients with TAL was performed to assess the effects of surgical therapy in the elderly cohort. Seventy-five cases were identified. Patients were assigned to one of two groups (Young < 55 or Old > or = 55) and data were analyzed for differences between them. There was a significantly higher mortality rate in the elderly patients (82.4% Old vs. 12.1% Young; p < 0.001). Moreover, surgical treatment in the Old group had up to a 163-fold increased likelihood of mortality compared with surgical treatment in the Young group (p < 0.001). We conclude that Old patients have higher mortality associated with surgical repair of TAL. Because of the increased risk of surgical intervention for TAL, elderly patients may be candidates for nonsurgical management as has been advocated for patients with asymptomatic peripheral traumatic pseudoaneurysms.";-;-;-;hard_0
3955541;Updating lung cancer mortality among a cohort of man-made mineral fibre production workers in seven European countries.;A historical cohort of 21,967 workers ever employed in 13 European factories manufacturing various types of man-made mineral fibres (MMMF) was observed until 1982. Overall there were 2719 deaths (standardised mortality ratio (SMR) = 111) of which 189 were from lung cancer (SMR = 125). For the glasswool and rockwool/slagwool production subcohorts the lung cancer SMRs rose with time since first exposure, exceeding 170 for the period of 30 or more years. Adjustment for regional variations in mortality substantially reduced the excess in the glasswool group, but not in the rockwool/slagwool. In neither subgroup was there any relationship of lung cancer mortality with length of employment. During the early years of rockwool/slagwool production there was the potential for much higher fibrous dust exposure than at present, because of the absence of dust suppressing oil and/or the use of a batch production process. In addition slag was widely used as a raw material. Amongst workers employed during the early phase, there were 10 lung cancer deaths giving SMRs of 270 and 244 for the periods 20-29 and 30 or more years since first exposure. This group accounts for most of the absolute excess of lung cancer for the rockwool/slagwool plants.;-;-;-;hard_0
8179312;Cleavage of epitectin, a mucin-type sialoglycoprotein, from the surface of human laryngeal carcinoma cells by a glycoprotease from Pasteurella haemolytica.;In this study we have assessed the action of a novel glycoprotease, secreted by the bovine pneumonia pathogen Pasteurella haemolytica, on epitectin expressed on the surface of human laryngeal carcinoma (H.Ep.2) cells. Epitectin has been previously characterized as a high buoyant density glycoprotein of mass of over 350 kDa extensively glycosylated on serine and threonine by small oligosaccharides. Purified metabolically labeled epitectin was very effectively hydrolyzed by the glycoprotease. However, short- and long-term treatments yielded a complex mixture of products which could not be resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) or column chromatography, probably because of the heterogeneity of the structure and the distribution of the saccharides. Treatment of H.Ep.2 cells with glycoprotease followed by flow cytometric analysis revealed a significant loss in the cell surface epitopes detected by the anti-epitectin Ca2 monoclonal antibody. The action of the glycoprotease on cell surface epitectin was blocked by anti-glycoprotease antisera and was absent in an extract of a glycoprotease-negative strain of P. haemolytica. When extracts of cells treated with glycoprotease for 4 h were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by 125I-wheat germ agglutinin overlay and autoradiography, the intensity of the characteristic epitectin bands was found to be drastically reduced compared to controls. H.Ep.2 cells metabolically labeled with [3H]glucosamine were also incubated with or without the glycoprotease and the released products were fractionated and analyzed. The enzyme-released products were found to be enriched in mucin-type glycopeptides. Thus the P. haemolytica glycoprotease could be used to selectively degrade mucin glycoproteins on cancer cell surface.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1

The GAL4-DBD alone had no transcriptional activation function. However, a mutant of the GAL4-DBD/NS5A fusion protein, in which 129 amino acid residues were deleted from the N-terminus of NS5A, exhibited strong transcriptional activation in yeast cells, bearing the Escherichia coli lacZ reporter gene encoding the beta-galactosidase under the transcriptional control of GAL4 promoter and TATA box. Further mutational analysis of NS5A revealed that the region between the amino acid residues 130 to 352 were critical for optimal level of transactivation. This region includes two acidic domains and one proline-rich region which have been shown to be involved in the function of several transcriptional activators.;proline;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
522129;Partial purification of the sugar carrier of intestinal brush border membranes. Enrichment of the phlorizin-binding component by selective extractions.;The [3H] phlorizin-binding component of brush border vesicles was enriched in situ by negative purification. Several procedures, known to effect selective solubilization of membrane components, were used separately or in combination to remove proteins unrelated to the binding. Deoxycholate ruptured the vesicles and released 67% of their protein, thereby increasing the specific [3H] phlorizin-binding activity of the pellet three-to fourfold. Extracting the deoxycholate-pellets with either NaI or alkaline solutions released up to 38% of the deoxycholate-insoluble protein without significantly affecting phlorizin binding. The polypeptide composition of the membranes at the different stages was analyzed by NaDodSO4-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A number of polypeptides present in the original vesicles could be ruled out as essential components of the [3H] phlorizin binding entity. Intact and deoxycholate-treated vesicles were subjected to proteolytic attack. Papain liberated sucrase and isomaltase from intact vesicles, but affected neither other Coomassie-stained bands nor phlorizin binding. Neither the protein composition nor the binding properties of sealed vesicles were influenced by trypsin or chymotrypsin. However, all the proteolytic enzymes tested on deoxycholate-treated membranes substantially reduced [3H] phlorizin binding and produced concomitantly the disappearance of several bands from the electrophoretic profile. Pretreatment of vesicles with papain, followed by deoxycholate extraction and incubation in alkaline media, increased the specific binding activity of the membranes up to ninefold by removing close to 90% of the protein. A limited number of polypeptides are suggested as possible candidates for the glycoside-binding site of intestinal brush borders.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1

The 3' end terminates at an internal EcoRI site before the polyA tail. Due to the arrangement of the cDNA insert in the lambda gt11 vector, the MAP2 fragment is not fused to beta-galactosidase when expressed. The Chou Fasman algorithm for the initial 58 amino acids from the first in-frame methionine predicts an alpha helix. Beyond this point, a series of turns is predicted until amino acid 160. The frequent presence of basic residues in proximity to serines or threonines is consistent with multiple phosphorylation sites. The minimum specificity determinant for Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase is repeated 13 times. The sequence of a region containing a MAP2 epitope that is shared with the Alzheimer neurofibrillary tangle was determined by DNase treatment of the cDNA and antibody selecting the small resultant clones in a lambda gt11 sublibrary. Likewise, a MAP2 epitope that is not shared with the neurofibrillary tangle also has been located. Both epitopes are in the projection portion of the molecule. A bovine MAP2 cyanogen bromide fragment, which contains the epitope shared with the neurofibrillary tangle, is partially insoluble under aqueous conditions, probably due to the aggregation of oppositely charged residues. Thus, rapid cleavage of MAP2 to small peptides is probably necessary in vivo to prevent the aggregation of larger cleavage fragments.;alanine;helix;-;LCR_with_function

A fluorescent intercalator displacement (FID) assay conducted on p[dA]-p[dT] DNA to obtain C(50) values and a hairpin deoxyoligonucleotide containing an A/T-rich binding site was used to evaluate DNA binding affinity.

1068475;Structural heterogeneity of mitochondrial DNA molecules within the genus Drosophila.;We have determined by electron microscopy the molecular weight of circular mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecules from 39 species representing 13 groups of five subgenera of the genus Drosophila. mtDNA molecules of all species examined, other than members of the melanogaster group, had, with one exception, molecular weights in the rather narrow range 9.90 X 10(6). The one exception was D. robusta, which had a molecular weight of 10.61 X 10(6). In contrast, mtDNA molecules from species within the melanogaster group had molecular weights covering the considerably greater range 9.92 X 10(6) to 12.35 X 10(6). Applying the electron microscope denaturation mapping technique of Inman to mtDNA molecules of eight species of the melanogaster group, we found each of them to contain a region [presumably rich in adenine and thymine (A+T)] which denatured at a specific temperature (40 degrees) at which most of the remainder of the molecule remained undenatured. The size of the A+T-rich region was constant for mtDNA molecules of a species, but varied from 0.62 X 10(6) to 3.41 X 10(6) for mtDNA molecules of different species. It was demonstrated that the differences in molecular weights of the A+T-rich regions can almost completely account for the differences in total molecular weights of the mtDNA molecules from species of the melanogaster group.;threonine;-;-;LCR_without_function
7957917;Identification of amino acid residues associated with the [2Fe-2S] cluster of the 25 kDa (NQO2) subunit of the proton-translocating NADH-quinone oxidoreductase of Paracoccus denitrificans.;In order to identify the ligand residues of the [2Fe-2S] cluster of the 25 kDa (NQO2) subunit of the proton-translocating NADH-quinone oxidoreductase of Paracoccus denitrificans, we mutated individually all seven cysteine residues (C61, C96, C101, C104, C113, C137, and C141) and one conserved histidine residue (H92) to Ser or Ala and expressed them in E. coli. After purification of the mutated 25 kDa subunits, the effect of mutations on the iron-sulfur cluster were characterized by chemical analyses and UV-visible and EPR spectroscopy. All mutated subunits, especially mutants of conserved cysteines, contained lower amounts of non-heme iron than wild-type. The subunits of three non-conserved cysteine residues (C61, C104, and C113) mutated to Ser and a histidine residue (H92) mutated to Ala exhibited essentially the same spectroscopic properties as those of the wild-type subunit. In contrast, mutation of the four conserved cysteine residues (C96, C101, C137, and C141) to Ser or Ala considerably altered the UV-visible and EPR spectra from the wild-type subunit. These results indicate that the four conserved cysteine residues coordinate the [2Fe-2S] cluster in the P. denitrificans 25 kDa subunit.;-;-;-;hard_0
30057901;3' RNA Uridylation in Epitranscriptomics, Gene Regulation, and Disease.;Emerging evidence implicates a wide range of post-transcriptional RNA modifications that play crucial roles in fundamental biological processes including regulating gene expression. Collectively, they are known as epitranscriptomics. Recent studies implicate 3' RNA uridylation, the non-templated addition of uridine(s) to the terminal end of RNA, as a key player in epitranscriptomics. In this review, we describe the functional roles and significance of 3' terminal RNA uridylation that has diverse functions in regulating both mRNAs and non-coding RNAs. In mammals, three Terminal Uridylyl Transferases (TUTases) are primarily responsible for 3' RNA uridylation. These enzymes are also referred to as polyU polymerases. TUTase 1 (TUT1) is implicated in U6 snRNA maturation via uridylation. The TUTases TUT4 and/or TUT7 are the predominant mediators of all other cellular uridylation. Terminal uridylation promotes turnover for many polyadenylated mRNAs, replication-dependent histone mRNAs that lack polyA-tails, and aberrant structured noncoding RNAs. In addition, uridylation regulates biogenesis of a subset of microRNAs and generates isomiRs, sequent variant microRNAs that have altered function in specific cases. For example, the RNA binding protein and proto-oncogene LIN28A and TUT4 work together to polyuridylate pre-let-7, thereby blocking biogenesis and function of the tumor suppressor let-7 microRNA family. In contrast, monouridylation of Group II pre-miRNAs creates an optimal 3' overhang that promotes recognition and subsequent cleavage by the Dicer-TRBP complex that then yields the mature microRNA. Also, uridylation may play a role in non-canonical microRNA biogenesis. The overall significance of 3' RNA uridylation is discussed with an emphasis on mammalian development, gene regulation, and disease, including cancer and Perlman syndrome. We also introduce recent changes to the HUGO-approved gene names for multiple terminal nucleotidyl transferases that affects in part TUTase nomenclature (TUT1/TENT1, TENT2/PAPD4/GLD2, TUT4/ZCCHC11/TENT3A, TUT7/ZCCHC6/TENT3B, TENT4A/PAPD7, TENT4B/PAPD5, TENT5A/FAM46A, TENT5B/FAM46B, TENT5C/FAM46C, TENT5D/FAM46D, MTPAP/TENT6/PAPD1). ;-;nucleic acid binding;-;hard_2
9792408;A frequent TG deletion near the polyadenylation signal of the human HEXB gene: occurrence of an irregular DNA structure and conserved nucleotide sequence motif in the 3' untranslated region.;While screening for new mutations in the HEXB gene, which encodes the beta-subunit of beta-hexosaminidase, a TG deletion (deltaTG) was found in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the gene, 7 bp upstream from the polyadenylation signal. Examination of DNA samples of 145 unrelated Argentinean individuals from different racial backgrounds showed that the deltaTG allele was present with a frequency of approximately 0.1, compared with the wild-type (WT) allele. The deletion was not associated with infantile or variant forms of Sandhoff disease when present in combination with a deleterious allele. Total Hex and Hex B enzymatic activities measured in individuals heterozygous for deltaTG and a null allele, IVS-2 + 1G-->A (G-->A), were approximately 30% lower than the activities of G-->A/WT individuals. Analysis of the HEXB mRNA from leukocytes of deltaTG/WT individuals by RT-PCR of the 3'UTR showed that the deltaTG allele is present at lower level than the WT allele. By polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, it was determined that a PCR fragment containing the +TG version of the 3'UTR of the HEXB gene had an irregular structure. On inspection of genes containing a TG dinucleotide upstream from the polyadenylation signal we found that this dinucleotide was part of a conserved sequence (TGTTTT) immersed in a A/T-rich region. This sequence arrangement was present in more than 40% analyzed eukaryotic mRNAs, including in the human, mouse and cat HEXB genes. The significance of the TG deletion in reference to Sandhoff disease as well as the possible functional role of the consensus sequence and the DNA structure of the 3'UTR are considered.;threonine;-;polyacrylamide;LCR_with_hard
8455148;Blood transfusion as a major risk factor for HTLV-I infection among hospitalized children in Gabon (Equatorial Africa).;To study the risk factors for HTLV-I infection of African infants living in a high seroprevalence area, a survey was conducted among hospitalized children and their mothers in Franceville, southern Gabon. A total of 610 children (6 months to 14 years old) from 555 families and 434 mothers participated in the study. HTLV-I seroprevalence was 7.1% in the mothers and 2.8% in the children. No increase by age was observed in the children. Significantly more children with sickle cell anemia (11 of 57, or 19.2%) were infected than others (1%) (Fisher's exact test p < 0.001). Of the 13 seropositive infants (C+) whose mothers were tested, six (43%) had a seropositive mother (M+) [p < 0.001, prevalence ratio (PR) 10.12, 95% CI 3.40-30.35, attributable risk (AR) 0.55]. Risk factors for nonmaternally acquired HTLV-I infection were previous blood transfusion (Fisher's exact test p < 0.001, PR 15.74, CI 5.20-47.60, AR 0.71) and hospital admission. In a hospitalized pediatric population in Gabon mother-to-child transmission and blood transfusion (because of sickle cell disease) were equally implicated in HTLV-I infection. Control of HTLV-I infection in children in Africa requires prevention of both vertical and transfusion-associated transmission, which may be exceedingly difficult in developing countries.;-;-;-;hard_0
16047153;The weak bases NH(3) and trimethylamine inhibit the medium and slow afterhyperpolarizations in rat CA1 pyramidal neurons.;The weak bases NH(3) and trimethylamine (TMeA), applied externally, are widely used to investigate the effects of increasing intracellular pH (pH(i)) on neuronal function. However, potential effects of the compounds independent from increases in pH(i) are not usually considered. In whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from rat CA1 pyramidal neurons, bath application of 1-40 mM NH(4)Cl or TMeA HCl reduced resting membrane potential and input resistance, inhibited the medium and slow afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs) and their respective underlying currents, mI(ahp) and sI(ahp), and led to the development of depolarizing current-evoked burst firing. Examined in the presence of 1 microM TTX and 5 mM TEA with 10 mM Hepes in the recording pipette, NH(3) and TMeA increased pH(i) and the magnitudes of depolarization-evoked intracellular [Ca(2+)] transients, Ca(2+)-dependent depolarizing potentials, and inward Ca(2+) currents but reduced the slow AHP and sI(ahp). When internal H(+) buffering power was raised by including 100 mM tricine in the patch pipette, the effects of NH(3) and TMeA to increase pH(i) and augment Ca(2+) influx were attenuated whereas the reductions in the slow AHP and sI(ahp) (as well as membrane potential and input resistance) were maintained. The findings indicate that increases in pH(i) contribute to the increases in Ca(2+) influx observed in the presence of NH(3) and TMeA but not to the reductions in membrane potential, input resistance or the magnitudes of AHPs. The results have implications for the interpretation of data from experiments in which pH(i) is manipulated by the external application of NH(3) or TMeA.;-;-;-;hard_0

1727862;MHC class I-restricted presentation of exogenous antigen by thymic antigen-presenting cells in vitro and in vivo.;We have used a T-T hybridoma, RF33.70, to detect the MHC class I-restricted presentation of exogenous native OVA by thymic APC in vitro. Presentation of OVA with class I molecules by thymic APC requires intracellular processing. Phenotypic analyses indicated that low bouyant density, MHC class II+, FcR+ cells are capable of using this presentation pathway. In order to determine whether thymic APC have this function in vivo, thymic APC were isolated from mice after i.v. injection of native OVA. We find that OVA is presented in association with MHC class I, but not class II, molecules in the thymus. This is in contrast to splenic APC, which present exogenous OVA with both class I and class II molecules under these conditions. Our findings have implications for the repertoire of self-peptides that might be presented by thymic APC to developing T lymphocytes.;-;antigen;-;hard_2

The speed of the reaction was evaluated according to the increase of the content of citrullin (the combination of carbamate kinase and ornithine transcarbamoylase). The representatives of different serological groups were found to have quantitative differences in carbamate kinase activity: the highest specific activity (13 nmol of citrullin per minute in 1 mg of dried microbial biomass) was detected in group A streptococci, while group D streptococci showed the lowest specific activity (0.5 nmol).;-;kinase activity;-;hard_2
3250226;The H1 and core histone subtypes: differential gene expression and varied primary structures.;The patterns of chromosomal proteins reflect in many cases the functional state of the respective cell type. The H1 histone group is particularly important in this respect, since these histones are involved in the higher order chromatin organization above the level of chains of nucleosomes. In mammals, the H1 histone family comprises at least five main subtypes (H1a-H1e), a testicular variant (H1t) and, thirdly, a subtype H1(0), which is found only in terminally differentiated cells. The H1(0) variant is structurally related to the avian red blood cell specific histone H5, which was the basis for our recent isolation of the human H1(0) gene. Changes of H1 histone patterns may be crucial events in modulating local chromatin arrangements, since the formation of higher order chromatin structures depends on a cooperative interaction of the H1 histones. Variations in their patterns can be studied in vivo during several developmental processes (such as spermatogenesis, erythropoiesis, maturation of several cell types) or in vitro in several tumor cell lines upon treatment with several inducers or upon inhibition of cell division. The differential regulation of the individual H1 subtypes is reflected in the gene and mRNA structures coding for the respective proteins. The cell cycle regulated histones are mostly encoded by non-polyadenylated mRNAs, whereas H5 as well as H1(0) mRNA shows a poly(A) tail at its 3' end. In conclusion, gene activity may not only be controlled at the level of RNA polymerases and their regulatory transcription factors. The varied patterns of chromosomal proteins at different stages during development and differentiation suggest that the local or overall organization of chromatin plays an additional role in these regulatory programs. Hence, the analysis of variations in patterns of chromosomal proteins is an integral part of the investigation of gene regulation mechanisms. ;alanine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
20685276;Crystal Structure of the 2-Oxoglutarate- and Fe(II)-Dependent Lysyl Hydroxylase JMJD6.;Lysyl and prolyl hydroxylations are well-known post-translational modifications to animal and plant proteins with extracellular roles. More recent work has indicated that the hydroxylation of intracellular animal proteins may be common. JMJD6 catalyses the iron- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent hydroxylation of lysyl residues in arginine-serine-rich domains of RNA-splicing-related proteins. We report crystallographic studies on the catalytic domain of JMJD6 in complex with Ni(II) substituting for Fe(II). Together with mutational studies, the structural data suggest how JMJD6 binds its lysyl residues such that it can catalyse C-5 hydroxylation rather than N(varepsilon)-demethylation, as for analogous enzymes.;serine;-;-;LCR_without_function
1750519;Localization of ral, a small Mr GTP-binding protein, to collecting duct cells in bovine and rat kidney.;Plasma membranes from bovine kidney cortex were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blotting with [alpha-32P]GTP and [35S]GTP gamma S demonstrated specific binding to three and six distinct protein bands, respectively, in the 20,000- to 29,000-Mr range. This indicated the presence of small Mr GTP binding proteins (smg) in bovine kidney cortex. Only one smg with 28,000 Mr was labeled with hydrolysis-resistant GTP photoaffinity probe p3-(4-azidoanilido)-p1-5GTP (AAGTP). The major smg in platelet membranes that binds GTP on nitrocellulose blots has been identified as ral-Mr 29,000. With the use of an antiserum against the ral A gene product, one of the smg with Mr of 29,000 present in bovine renal cortical plasma membranes was identified as ral. Ral was absent from glomerular homogenate, suggesting that it is localized to the tubular segments of the nephron. Ral was detected only in the particulate fraction and not the cytosol. Further subcellular localization of ral was investigated by immunohistochemical staining. Anti-ral antibody immunostained the apical and basolateral membranes of cells in the cortical and medullary collecting ducts in a speckled pattern in the bovine kidney. In the rat kidney, however, uniform linear staining of cortical and medullary collecting ducts predominantly localized to the apical membrane was observed. To date, no function has been assigned to ral. Localization of the ral gene product to the collecting duct suggests a specific functional role for this GTP-binding protein.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
2439064;Identification and characterization of the 2D6 and Mr 23,000 antigens on the plasma membrane of rat spermatozoa.;Previous investigations [Jones, Brown, von Glos & Gaunt (1985) Exp. Cell Res. 156, 31-44] have demonstrated the appearance of a new antigenic determinant (recognized by monoclonal antibody 2D6) on the plasma membrane of rat spermatozoa during post-testicular maturation in the epididymis. Identification of the 2D6 antigen on Western blots from one-dimensional SDS/polyacrylamide gels revealed that it co-migrated with a membrane protein (designated Mr 23,000 antigen) present on testicular and immature germ cells, suggesting that one antigen might be a modified version of the other. In the present work, however, we demonstrate that, although they have similar Mr and are present in soluble and membrane-bound forms, the 2D6 and Mr 23,000 antigens are biochemically and immunologically distinct molecules. The properties of the antigens are described and compared. The Mr 23,000 antigen is present on both testicular and cauda epididymidal spermatozoa, has a pI of 6.1, contains no detectable carbohydrate, is not tissue-specific and is degraded by V8 protease. By contrast, the 2D6 antigen is glycosylated, has a broad pI from 4.5 to 6.1, is tissue- and species-specific and is resistant to digestion with V8 protease.

2464926;Characterization of mutations in Gaucher patients by cDNA cloning.;Mutated cDNA clones containing the entire coding sequence of human glucocerebrosidase were isolated from libraries originated from Gaucher patients. Sequence analysis of a mutated cDNA derived from a type II Gaucher patient revealed a C-to-G transversion causing a substitution of an arginine for a proline at residue 415. This change creates a new cleavage site for the enzyme HhaI in the mutated cDNA. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization made it possible to show that this mutation exists in the genomic DNA of the patient. From a cDNA library originated from a type I Gaucher patient, a mutated allele was cloned that contains a T-to-C transition causing a substitution of proline for leucine at residue 444 and creating a new NciI site. This mutation is identical to that described by S. Tsuji and colleagues in genomic DNA from type I, type II, and type III patients. Since the new NciI site generates RFLP, it was used to test the existence of this mutated allele in several Gaucher patients by Southern blot analysis. This allele was found in type I (Jewish and non-Jewish), type II, and type III Gaucher patients. These findings led us to conclude that the patient suffering from type II disease (denoted GM1260) carried both mutations described above. Any one of the amino acid changes described reduces the glucocerebrosidase activity as tested by transfection of COS cells with expression vectors harboring the mutated cDNAs. The base changes in the two mutated cDNAs do not affect the electrophoretic mobility of the corresponding polypeptides on an SDS polyacrylamide gel.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
7130928;Characterization of spermatid/sperm basic chromosomal proteins in the genus Xenopus (Anura, Pipidae).;Spermatid/sperm basic chromosomal proteins from 17 species and subspecies of the genus Xenopus (Anura, Pipidae) were compared. Electrophoresis on acetic acid/urea/Triton X-100 polyacrylamide gels revealed that each Xenopus species with a diploid chromosome number of 36, 72, or 108 showed multiple, diverse spermatid/sperm-specific basic chromatin proteins with mobilities greater than the somatic histones. The numbers and mobilities of these proteins were characteristic of each Xenopus species and each subspecies of Xenopus laevis. Cytochemical tests revealed that the sperm basic nuclear proteins of these Xenopus species and subspecies were rich in arginine and lysine and contained more arginine than the nuclear proteins of somatic cells. X. tropicalis (2n = 20) and X. sp. n. (Zaire) displayed spermatid/sperm-specific basic chromatin proteins which migrated within the histone H1 region of acetic acid/urea/Triton X-100 polyacrylamide gels. Cytochemically the sperm nuclei of these species resembled those of somatic cells.

8378324;Genomic organization of the melanoma-associated glycoprotein MUC18: implications for the evolution of the immunoglobulin domains.;The cell surface glycoprotein MUC18, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and homologous to several cell adhesion molecules, is associated with tumor progression and the development of metastasis in human malignant melanoma. Immunohistochemical and Northern blot analysis revealed that expression of the antigen is restricted to advanced primary and metastatic melanomas and to cell lines of the neuroectodermal lineage. The genomic sequence encoding the cell surface antigen spans approximately 14 kb and consists of 16 exons. The organization of the gene, which is related to that of the neural cell adhesion molecule N-CAM, shows a structure where each immunoglobulin-related domain is encoded by more than one exon. Sequencing of the putative MUC18 promoter region revealed a G + C-rich promoter lacking conventional TATA and CAAT boxes. Several motifs for binding of transcription factor Sp1 are present in the regulatory region, and only a single transcription start site within a presumed initiator sequence was identified. Sequence elements which might confer melanocyte-specific expression were not detected. Instead, recognition sequences for the transcription factors CREB, AP-2, and c-Myb, as well as CArG-box motifs, were observed. These elements may contribute to the differential regulation of the MUC18 gene in normal and malignant tissues and suggest a role for this putative adhesion molecule in neural crest cells during embryonic development.;cysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

Evidence for the interaction was obtained by ultrafiltration, chromatography on Sepharose 4B, and sedimentation velocity ultracentrifugation.

The electrophoretic mobility of the main protein components in the isolated preparation of LAP coincides with that of endotoxin components. The dissociation of proteins and lipopolysaccharide in the process of boiling the endotoxin in 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate is indicative of the noncovalent binding of these components. LAP contained in the endotoxin, in contrast to isolated LAP, is resistant to trypsin and proteinase K. The enzyme immunoassay (EIA) system with the use of LAP as a component of its solid phase has been developed, which makes it possible to carry out the quantitative determination of antibodies to this protein. The EIA system shows high sensitivity in the determination of anti-LAP IgG antibodies: in hyperimmune rabbit sera their titer is 1:250,000-1:800,000. As shown by the method of competitive EIA, the antigenic affinity of LAP of different origin corresponds to the degree of taxonomic propinquity of microorganisms: the maximal degree of cross reactions is observed between LAP obtained from S. sonnei, S. flexneri and Escherichia coli, while their affinity to Salmonella typhi is considerably less; remote microbial species (Bacterium bifidum and Sarcina marcescens) give practically no cross reactions.";-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3

Initial parasitemias were eradicated by a curative treatment with quinine, a drug with a short elimination half-life, to minimize the effects of residual drug on reinfection. The seroreactivities to seven oligopeptides, representing T and B cell epitopes from the ring erythrocyte surface antigen (Pf155/RESA), the clustered arginine-rich protein antigen (CARP), and the circumsporozoite (CS) proteins were determined in the children at the start of the study and after 28 days. All children were reinfected within 42 days (mean 27 days). The geometric mean maximum parasite density at reinfection was 308 parasites per microliter (range 4-13, 920). The antipeptide antibody levels showed high interindividual variation, with a significant mean decrease (16%) between days 0 and 28 for the blood stage antigens, but not for the (NANP)6 peptide from the CS protein. This suggests that the absence of blood stage antigenic stimulation had already influenced the antibody levels within this short period of time. The mean reinfection day was not influenced by the levels of antibodies to any of the peptides. However, the children with higher antibody levels to (EENVEHDA)2(EENV)2 developed significantly lower parasitemias than those with lower antibody levels (P less than 0.05).

8064854;Structure-function relationship of the Lrp-binding region upstream of lysU in Escherichia coli.;In Escherichia coli, one of the two genes encoding lysyl-tRNA synthetase, lysU, belongs to the regulon controlled by the leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp). To map the site of Lrp action, mutants escaping regulation in rich medium were generated through random mutagenesis of the lysU promoter region. The mutations showed parallel effects on the strength of Lrp-DNA association, as measured in vitro by gel retardation experiments, and on the degree of repression of lysU expression by Lrp in vivo. In addition, DNase I and hydroxyl radical footprinting experiments indicated that several Lrp molecules bind to a DNA region of over 110 bp in a highly cooperative manner. This region, which encompasses the -35 box of the lysU promoter, was the target of all the mutations affecting the strength of the Lrp-DNA association. These mutations are frequently located in short A + T-rich runs distributed along the Lrp binding region with a periodicity of one helix turn. Because we could find such a regular alternance of A + T runs upstream of several other Lrp-regulated genes, we suggest that this pattern is one feature indicative of the binding of Lrp. ;threonine;helix;-;LCR_with_function

Over the range of the matrix concentration examined (Cp = 0.1-10 mg/ml), the diffusivities of the PS spheres and the large multilamellar vesicles exhibited the Stokes-Einstein (SE) relation, while the diffusivity of the unilamellar vesicles did not follow the increase of the solution's viscosity caused by the presence of the matrix molecules. The difference between the diffusion behaviors of unilamellar vesicles and hard PS spheres of similar size is possibly due to the flexibility of the lipid bilayer of the vesicles. The unilamellar vesicles are capable of changing their shape to move through the entangled polymer solution so that the hindrance to their diffusion due to the presence of the polymer chains is reduced, while the rigid PS spheres have little flexibility and they encounter greater resistance. The multilamellar vesicles are less flexible, thus their diffusion is similar to the hard PS spheres of similar diameter.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
2835508;Rapid selection of genetic and antigenic variants of foot-and-mouth disease virus during persistence in cattle.;"Rapid evolution of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is documented during persistent infections of cattle. The carrier state was established experimentally with plaque-purified FMDV of serotype C3. Virus was recovered from the esophageal pharyngeal area of the animals up to 539 days postinfection. Analysis of capsid proteins by electrofocusing and by electrophoretic mobility of the genomic poly(C)-rich tract suggested heterogeneity in several isolates and sequential dominance of viral subpopulations. Nucleotide sequences of the VP1-coding region of the parental FMDV C3 clones and of seven isolates from the carrier cattle showed point mutations that represented rates of fixation of mutations of 0.9 X 10(-2) to 7.4 X 10(-2) substitutions per nucleotide per year; 59% of the base changes led to amino acid substitutions, some of which were located within residues 135 to 151, a region involved in neutralization of FMDV. In the esophageal pharyngeal fluid samples, FMDV C3-neutralizing activity was present. Antigenic variation was demonstrated with monoclonal antibodies raised against FMDV C3. Two isolates from carrier cattle differed from the parental virus by 10(2)- or 10(3)-fold decreased reactivity with neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. We suggest that persistent, inapparent infections of ruminants, in addition to being a reservoir of virus, may promote the rapid selection of antigenically variant FMDVs.";cysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

1383321;Activation of human basophils through the IL-8 receptor.;IL-8 and its structural analogs derived from blood platelets have been proposed as stimuli of IgE-independent basophil activation. In order to clarify the mechanism of action of these peptides, we examined the effects of pure IL-8, connective tissue-activating peptide III (CTAP-III), neutrophil-activating peptide 2 (NAP-2), and platelet factor 4 (PF-4) on blood basophils with and without pretreatment by IL-3, which modulates mediator release. After pretreatment with IL-3, significant histamine release was observed with 10(-8) M and 10(-7) M IL-8 and 10(-7) M NAP-2, but not with the other peptides. At higher concentrations (10(-6) M), however, all IL-8 analogs, as well as the unrelated cationic peptides poly-D-lysine, histone VS, and lysozyme, induced histamine release to variable degrees. Binding and competition studies with [125I]IL-8 revealed specific IL-8R on basophils from a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia and normal individuals. From 3500 to 9600 receptors with a mean Kd value of 0.15 nM were found on average per chronic myelogenous leukemia and normal basophil, respectively. NAP-2 weakly competed for IL-8 binding. IL-8 and, to a lesser extent, NAP-2 led to a transient rise of cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i), which was independent of a preexposure to IL-3. IL-8 prevented the [Ca2+]i rise induced by NAP-2, but did not influence [Ca2+]i responses to other agonists, e.g. C5a, C3a, or platelet-activating factor. IL-8 induced [Ca2+]i changes and histamine release in IL-3-primed basophils were pertussis toxin sensitive. CTAP-III or PF-4 did not compete for IL-8 binding, did not induce [Ca2+]i changes, and did not influence the [Ca2+]i response to IL-8 and NAP-2. This study shows that IL-8 and NAP-2 activate human basophils by a receptor-mediated mechanism similar to that operating in neutrophils. At high concentrations histamine release can also be induced by cationic peptides by a mechanism that does not involve the IL-8R, and probably depends on cationic interactions.;aspartic_acid;-;-;LCR_without_function
1454060;Refined definition of the 56K and other autoantigens in the 50-60 kDa region.;"Alteration of the acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel used for Western blotting strongly improved the unambiguous detection of antibodies against 50-60 kDa autoantigens present in autoimmune patient sera. The relative migration of Ro52, the 56K autoantigen and calreticulin increased with reduced acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratios in contrast to that of Ro60, La and Jo-1. These analyses indicated that these six autoantigens correspond to six distinct polypeptides. Further analyses using recombinant calreticulin showed that (i) the 56K autoantigen is neither identical nor related to calreticulin and (ii) calreticulin is not a Ro autoantigen. A series of experiments designed to better characterize the 56K autoantigen showed that (i) the antigen is not detectable in fixed cells, presumably due to masking of the epitopes; (ii) about equal amounts of the antigen were recovered in nuclear and cytoplasmic cell fractions after enucleation of the cells; (iii) the 56K autoantigen is not stably associated with either RNA or other proteins.";-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
2404021;Purification of profilin from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and analysis of profilin-deficient cells.;"We have isolated profilin from yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and have microsequenced a portion of the protein to confirm its identity; the region microsequenced agrees with the predicted amino acid sequence from a profilin gene recently isolated from S. cerevisiae (Magdolen, V., U. Oechsner, G. Müller, and W. Bandlow. 1988. Mol. Cell. Biol. 8:5108-5115). Yeast profilin resembles profilins from other organisms in molecular mass and in the ability to bind to polyproline, retard the rate of actin polymerization, and inhibit hydrolysis of ATP by monomeric actin. Using strains that carry disruptions or deletions of the profilin gene, we have found that, under appropriate conditions, cells can survive without detectable profilin. Such cells grow slowly, are temperature sensitive, lose the normal ellipsoidal shape of yeast cells, often become multinucleate, and generally grow much larger than wild-type cells. In addition, these cells exhibit delocalized deposition of cell wall chitin and have dramatically altered actin distributions.";proline;-;-;LCR_without_function
2364499;[Ultrastructural localization of Leishmania donovani antigen by immunogold labeling technique].;By using Lowicryl K4M, a kind of low temperature embedding resin, to embed promastigotes of Leishmania donovani at -30 degrees C, the protozoal structure was well preserved when visualized by electron microscope. We have determined the distribution of the promastigote antigen of human and canine isolates of Leishmania donovani from Sichuan using two monoclonal antibodies combined with biotinylated goat antimouse IgG and streptavidin/colloidal gold conjugates. The results showed that the antigen recognized by the protective monoclonal antibody 2H6-E3 was mainly distributed in the outer side of promastigote membrane of Leishmania donovani Sichuan canine isolate. According to the high density of localized gold particles this antigen might be abundant in the promastigote membrane. This result facilitates further research on the component, property and function of this antigen. Monoclonal antibody 1H7-C2-E7 recognized the promastigote antigen of both human and canine isolates of Leishmania donovani from Sichuan, suggesting that these two isolates might share a common antigen, and 1H7-C2-E7 antibody might be used to diagnose the leishmaniasis caused by these two isolates.;-;antigen;-;hard_2

20674465;MYB transcription factors in Arabidopsis.;The MYB family of proteins is large, functionally diverse and represented in all eukaryotes. Most MYB proteins function as transcription factors with varying numbers of MYB domain repeats conferring their ability to bind DNA. In plants, the MYB family has selectively expanded, particularly through the large family of R2R3-MYB. Members of this family function in a variety of plant-specific processes, as evidenced by their extensive functional characterization in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). MYB proteins are key factors in regulatory networks controlling development, metabolism and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. The elucidation of MYB protein function and regulation that is possible in Arabidopsis will provide the foundation for predicting the contributions of MYB proteins to the biology of plants in general.;-;transcription factor;-;hard_2
4159250;Isolation of rabbit IgA antihapten antibody and demonstration of skin-sensitizing activity in homologous skin.;Multiple antibody components of rabbit antisera against p-azobenzenearsonate (R(p)) were studied with respect to their globulin nature and skin-sensitizing activity. IgA antibody was characterized by isolating two IgA-rich fractions from a specifically purified antibody preparation. Examination of these fractions showed that IgA antibodies existed in two molecular forms, one with a sedimentation constant of 7S and the other 9S. Skin-sensitizing activity was examined by a P-K type test and a PCA test with R(p)-rabbit serum albumin in homologous (rabbit) species. Only the 7S but not 9S IgA antibody sensitized rabbit skin. IgM antibody showed no activity and IgG antibody showed very low activity. In contrast, only IgG antibody was active in the P-K type test to sensitize a heterologous species (guinea pig). None of the antibodies of other classes showed sensitizing activity in heterologous skin. The 7S IgA antibody lost its sensitizing activity upon reduction and alkylation, although no change in its molecular size could be observed. The loss of sensitizing activity was not due to the destruction of antigen-binding activity since the treated 7S IgA antibody retained this activity as shown by radioimmunoelectrophoresis and by binding to the specific immunoadsorbent. The 9S IgA antibody was more resistant to these treatments than the IgM antibody and showed no indication of dissociation. The treated 9S IgA also retained antigen-binding activity. Both the P-K type and PCA reactions were considerably stronger when the interval between injections of antibody and antigen was 24 hr rather than 4 to 5 hr. ;-;antigen;-;hard_2
36038349;[Sorafenib regulates vascular endothelial growth factor by runt-related transcription factor-3 to inhibit angiogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma].;Objective: To investigate the molecular mechanism of sorafenib against hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: Sorafenib efficacy was screened and verified by the hepatocellular carcinoma patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) model. Veterinary B-mode ultrasonography and in vivo confocal laser scanning microscopy were used to observe PDX angiogenesis. Immunohistochemistry was used to observe the expression of proliferation and angiogenesis-related proteins in PDX tissue. Real-time quantitative PCR technology was used to observe the RUNX3 gene in PDX tissues. SPSS 17.0 statistical software was used for statistical analysis. Results: Four cases of PDX were used to screen the efficacy of sorafenib. PDX1 had a significant response to sorafenib, with an inhibition rate of 68.07%. Compared with the control group, sorafenib had significantly inhibited PDX1 relative tumor volume (5.76±2.14 vs. 11.71±2.87, P<0.05). Cell division index (39.50±7.72 vs. 67.10±9.14, P<0.05) and Ki67 expression (288.6±43.40 vs. 531.70±55.60, P<0.05) were significantly decreased. Veterinary B-mode ultrasonography showed evident blood flow signals in PDX1 tumors. In vivo confocal laser scanning microscopy results showed that sorafenib had significantly reduced the total vessel length (1573.00±236.21 vs. 2675.03±162.00, P<0.05) and area (11 145.33±1931.97 vs. 20 105.37±885.93, P<0.05)) of PDX1 tumors. Immunohistochemical results showed that sorafenib had significantly down-regulated the protein expressions of CD34 (27.55±3.76 vs. 45.47±5.57, P<0.05), VEGF (16.33±2.86 vs. 22.77±3.20, P<0.05) and MVD (38.75±6.01 vs. 55.50±8.61, P<0.05). Real-time PCR results showed that sorafenib had significantly up-regulated RUNX3 gene expression (2.14±0.71 vs. 1.00±0.36, P<0.05). However, there was a negative correlation between the expression of RUNX3 gene and the ratio of VEGF-positive cells in sorafenib group (R2=0.509 7). Conclusion: Sorafenib may inhibit the PDX angiogenesis and the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma by regulating the RUNX3-VEGF pathway.;-;transcription factor;-;hard_2
11279146;Positive regulatory domain I binding factor 1 silences class II transactivator expression in multiple myeloma cells.;The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II transactivator (CIITA) acts as a master switch to activate expression of the genes required for MHC-II antigen presentation. During B-cell to plasma cell differentiation, MHC-II expression is actively silenced, but the mechanism has been unknown. In plasma cell tumors such as multiple myeloma the repression of MHC-II is associated with the loss of CIITA. We have identified that positive regulatory domain I binding factor 1 (PRDI-BF1), a transcriptional repressor, inhibits CIITA expression in multiple myeloma cell lines. Repression of CIITA depends on the DNA binding activity of PRDI-BF1 and its specific binding site in the CIITA promoter. Deletion of a histone deacetylase recruitment domain in PRDI-BF1 does not inhibit repression of CIITA nor does blocking histone deacetylase activity. This is in contrast to PRDI-BF1 repression of the c-myc promoter. Repression of CIITA requires either the N-terminal acidic and conserved PR motif or the proline-rich domain. PRDI-BF1 has been shown to be a key regulator of B-cell and macrophage differentiation. These findings now indicate that PRDI-BF1 has at least two mechanisms of repression whose function is dependent on the nature of the target promoter. Importantly, PRDI-BF1 is defined as the key molecule in silencing CIITA and thus MHC-II in multiple myeloma cells. ;proline;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
9702211;Molecular modelling and footprinting studies of DNA minor groove binders: bisquaternary ammonium heterocyclic compounds.;We report new quantitative footprinting data which reveal differences in binding constants of bisquaternary ammonium heterocyclic compounds (BQA) with AT-rich DNA sites depending on the ligand structure and on the size and sequence of the DNA binding site. In an attempt to understand the dependence of binding affinity on the ligand structure we have performed quantum-chemical AM1 calculations on the BQA compounds and on subunits to explore the conformational space and to calculate the electronic and structural features of individual ligand conformations. Due to the properties of the rotatable backbone bonds, there is a large number of possible conformations with almost equal energy. We present a new method for the calculation of the radius of curvature of molecular structures. Assuming that strong binders should have a shape complementary to the DNA minor groove, this measure is used to select the optimum conformations for DNA-drug binding. The approach yields the correct ligand conformation for SN6999, for which an X-ray DNA-drug structure is known. The curvature of the optimum conformations of all ligands is compared with the experimental binding constants. A correlation is found between curvature and binding constant provided other structural factors do not vary. Therefore, we conclude that within structurally similar BQA compounds the extent of curvature is the relevant quantity which modulates the binding affinity.;threonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
1976569;RNA pseudoknot domain of tobacco mosaic virus can functionally substitute for a poly(A) tail in plant and animal cells.;The genomes of many RNA viruses terminate in a tertiary structure similar to the L-conformation of tRNAs and this structure is recognized by many tRNA-specific enzymes such as aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. Virtually the entire 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) RNA is involved in an extended tertiary structure containing, in addition to a tRNA-like structure, a pseudoknot domain that lies immediately upstream. Although the functions of these structures are not well understood, they are essential to the virus. We demonstrate that the addition of the 204-base TMV 3'-untranslated region to foreign mRNA constructs can increase gene expression up to 100-fold compared to nonadenylated mRNA. The 3'-UTR of TMV was equal to or greater than a polyadenylated tail in enhancing gene expression in electroporated dicot and monocot protoplasts. The TMV 3'-UTR is functionally similar to a polyadenylated tail in that it increases mRNA stability and translation and must be positioned at the 3' terminus to function efficiently. Similar effects on expression were observed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, demonstrating that the sequence functions in a wide range of eukaryotes. When the extended tertiary structure was dissected, the upstream pseudoknot domain was found to be largely responsible for increasing expression. The inclusion of the tRNA-like structure, however, was important for full regulation.;alanine;-;-;LCR_without_function
1577011;The effect of polylysine on casein-kinase-2 activity is influenced by both the structure of the protein/peptide substrates and the subunit composition of the enzyme.;The mechanism by which polybasic peptides stimulate the activity of casein kinase 2 (CK2) has been studied by comparing the effect of polylysine on the phosphorylation of a variety of protein and peptide substrates by the native CK2 holoenzyme and by its recombinant catalytic alpha subunit, either alone or in combination with the recombinant non-catalytic beta subunit. Calmodulin is not phosphorylated by the CK2 holoenzyme, in either the native or the reconstituted form, unless polylysine is added. In the presence of polylysine, it becomes a good substrate for CK2 (Km 14.2 microM, Kcat 4.6 mol.min-1.mol CK2-1). The recombinant alpha subunit, however, spontaneously phosphorylates calmodulin, this phosphorylation being actually inhibited rather than stimulated by polylysine. The calmodulin tridecapeptide, RKMKDTDSEEEIR, reproducing the phosphorylation site for CK2, is spontaneously phosphorylated by either CK2 holoenzyme or the recombinant alpha subunit with 5.8-fold and 2.8-fold stimulation by polylysine, respectively. The recombinant beta subunit of CK2 is itself a good exogenous substrate for the enzyme, its phosphorylation, however, is inhibited rather than enhanced by polylysine. On the contrary, the phosphorylation of the nonapeptide, MSSSEEVSW, reproducing the beta-subunit phosphoacceptor site, is dramatically stimulated by polylysine. Using a variety of small peptide substrates, it was shown that phosphorylation rate is diversely stimulated by polylysine. The observed stimulation, moreover, is variably accounted for by changes in Vmax and/or Km, depending on the structure of the peptide substrate. Maximum stimulation with all protein/peptide substrates tested requires the presence of the beta subunit, since the recombinant alpha subunit is much less responsive than CK2 holoenzyme, either native or reconstituted. While the phosphorylation of the peptide RRRDDDSDDD by CK2 is stimulated 2.8-fold, with 15 nM polylysine being required for half-maximal stimulation, a stimulation of only 1.9-fold, with 80 nM polylysine required for half-maximal stimulation, is attained with recombinant alpha subunit. The concentration of polylysine required for half-maximal stimulation is comparable to CK2 concentration and increases by increasing CK2 concentration, suggesting that polylysine primarily interacts with the enzyme, rather than with the peptide substrate.;lysine;-;-;LCR_without_function

7838376;Dephosphorylation of Alzheimer's disease abnormally phosphorylated tau by protein phosphatase-2A.;Microtubule-associated protein tau is abnormally hyperphosphorylated in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease, and is the major protein subunit of paired helical filaments. There is also a significant pool of non-paired helical filament abnormally phosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease brain. In the present study, the site-specific dephosphorylation of this Alzheimer's disease abnormally phosphorylated tau by protein phosphatase-2A was studied and compared with that by protein phosphatase-2B. The dephosphorylation was detected by its interaction with several phosphorylation-dependent antibodies to various abnormal phosphorylation sites. Protein phosphatase-2A was able to dephosphorylate the abnormally phosphorylated tau at Ser-46, Ser-199, Ser-202, Ser-396 and Ser-404, but not at Ser-235 (the amino acids are numbered according to the largest isoform of human tau, tau441). Two major types of protein phosphatase-2A, protein phosphatase-2A1 and -2A2, dephosphorylated the abnormally phosphorylated tau at approximately the same rate. After the abnormally phosphorylated tau was dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase-2A, its relative mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis increased. The dephosphorylation of the abnormal tau by protein phosphatase-2A1 and -2A2 was markedly stimulated by Mn2+. These results suggest that tau dephosphorylation is catalysed by protein phosphatase-2A in addition to protein phosphatase-2B. A deficiency of either protein phosphatase-2A or -2B, or both, may be involved in abnormal phosphorylation of tau in Alzheimer's disease.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1

11831708;Domains in middle-T antigen that cooperate in polyomavirus-mediated oncogenic transformation.;Middle-T antigen is the oncogenic protein of Polyomavirus and associates with several cellular enzymes involved in signal transduction, e.g., Src tyrosine kinases, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and Shc, an SH2 domain-containing adapter protein. We have shown earlier that middle-T is a target of a cell cycle-regulated serine/threonine-specific kinase, presumably p34cdc2. Phosphorylation of middle-T by p34cdc2 results in increased apparent M, weight of the protein on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Two threonine residues in positions 160 and 291, respectively, were identified in the middle-T sequence as putative targets of a cyclin-dependent kinase. Replacement of threonine 160 by alanine resulted in a transformation-defective mutant protein that was still capable of forming all the complexes with cellular proteins, suggesting that additional characteristics of middle-T are required for cell transformation. In the present study we report that the defect of the T160A middle-T mutant is compensated by mutations introduced into a domain encompassing amino acids 253 to 302. In particular, mutating serine 283, a canonical phosphorylation site for a cyclin-dependent kinase, to an alanine residue rendered the T160A middle-T mutant wild type. Based on these results we suggest that cell cycle-specific phosphorylation of specific serine and threonine residues by cyclin-dependent kinases regulates middle-T function.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
11120828;Delineation of the human systemic lupus erythematosus anti-Smith antibody response using phage-display combinatorial libraries.;The anti-Smith (Sm) autoantibody response is highly specific for systemic lupus erythematosus and is predominantly targeted to the Sm-B/B' and -D1 polypeptides. In all animal species thus far studied, anti-Sm Abs initially recognize proline-rich epitopes in the carboxyl terminus of the Sm-B/B' protein and subsequently to multiple other epitopes in B/B' and D. The absence of appropriate mAbs has limited our understanding of the genetic and structural basis of this autoimmune response. Using phage-display technology and lymphocytes from a systemic lupus erythematosus patient we have generated the first and only panel of human IgG anti-Sm mAbs thus far available. These Abs reproduced to a remarkable extent the serological reactivity of the patient. Epitope mapping and genetic studies revealed that the anti-Sm response is produced by distinct B cell clones with restricted epitope reactivity. All of the Abs in our study were exclusively encoded by different members of the V(H)4 gene family. On the aggregate, our results demonstrate that combinatorial libraries can recapitulate the immune repertoire of peripheral blood B memory cells and that epitope spreading appears to occur through the sequential recruitment of nonclonally related autoreactive B cell clones. ;proline;-;-;LCR_without_function

In a murine model a combined though not a single application of antibodies against LFA-1 and ICAM-1 can induce tolerance towards heart transplants. No information regarding a possible synergistic action in man is as yet available. To fill this blank we tested the immunosuppressive capacity of ANTILFA (alpha-LFA-1)- and BIRR1 (alpha-ICAM-1) on human cells in vitro alone and in combination. Allogeneic venous endothelial cells, the lymphoblastoid cell line MSAB or peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used as stimulation. DNA synthesis, IL-2 production and cytotoxic T cell lysis were measured to assess T cell response. The strongest antibody effects were seen when endothelial cells were used as stimulators with the T cell response being assessed by IL-2 production. Most assays showed a similar immunosuppressive effect of LFA-1 and ICAM-1 blocking while the combination of both antibodies was not significantly more effective than each antibody alone. Thus our data do not provide a rationale for clinical trials using a combination of these antibodies.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
6733803;Macromolecular covalent binding of [14C]nitrobenzene in the erythrocyte and spleen of rats and mice.;"Nitrobenzene exposure is known to produce red blood cell damage as well as engorgement and sinusoidal congestion of the spleen in male Fischer-344 (F-344) rats but not in male B6C3F1 mice. These studies were conducted to investigate the species differences in the covalent binding of [14C]nitrobenzene in the erythrocyte and spleen and to assess the contribution of nitrobenzene-induced erythrocytic damage to the splenic effects. Total and covalently bound 14C concentrations in erythrocytes of rats were 6-13 times greater than those of mice following a single oral dose of 75, 150, 200 or 300 mg/kg [14C]nitrobenzene, suggesting that species differences in nitrobenzene-induced red blood cell toxicity may be related to differences in erythrocytic accumulation of nitrobenzene and its metabolites. Covalently bound 14C in erythrocytes of rats peaked 24 h following administration of 200 mg [14C]nitrobenzene/kg; in contrast, bound radiolabel in erythrocytes from mice plateaued at 10 h. Splenic engorgement increased in a time-related manner in treated rats but not in mice. Species specificity was also observed in the accumulation of bound radiolabel in the spleen. Gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of lysed, dialyzed erythrocytes from treated rats revealed that hemoglobin was the primary, if not the exclusive, site of macromolecular covalent binding following nitrobenzene treatment. SDS-PAGE of dialyzed rat spleens revealed that 82% of total bound 14C migrated identically to hemoglobin. These data indicate that covalent binding of [14C]nitrobenzene and its metabolites in the spleen is primarily derived from bound 14C from scavenged erythrocytes. Therefore, the species differences in splenic engorgement and accumulation of [14C]nitrobenzene may be related to differences in susceptibility to nitrobenzene-induced red blood cell damage.";-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
8011618;Evidence of novel secondary structure in DNA-bound protamine is revealed by Raman spectroscopy.;Raman spectroscopy studies of protamine-DNA complexes are reported for samples in the solid state at 98% relative humidity. Previous reports utilizing other physical techniques have indicated the presence of B-form DNA in protamine-DNA complexes. The present Raman data support the assignment of a modified B-form which is characterized by appreciable unstacking of the bases. The quality of the present spectra has made it possible, for the first time, to obtain the Raman spectrum of DNA-bound protamine by digital spectral subtraction. The difference spectrum indicates that protamine adopts an unusual secondary structure upon binding to DNA. A dominant amide I band is observed at 1683 cm-1 which is indicative of neither an alpha-helix or beta-sheet conformation. An amide I band at this position has been associated with the 1-->3 hydrogen bond that occurs within a gamma-turn [Bandekar, J., & Krimm, S. (1985) Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 26, 158-165]. On the basis of this assignment, as well as preliminary results obtained by computer modeling, we propose a new model for the secondary structure of DNA-bound protamine that is rich in 1-->3 hydrogen bonding. Spectral data demonstrate that this structure is absent in protamine molecules in solution. Analyses of spectra of polyarginine-DNA complexes suggest that polyarginine, although similar to protamine in primary structure, assumes a conformation when bound to DNA that is distinct from that adopted by protamine. ;arginine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
18481301;Gene cloning and expression analysis of ubiquitin derived from Musca domestica.;Ubiquitin (Ub) is a highly conserved 8-kDa protein that was first identified as a tag for protein degradation. Recently, its role in nonproteolytic cellular processes such as DNA repair and endocytosis has also been reported. An ubiquitin-fusion gene was cloned from Musca domestica. The complete length of this ubiquitin-fusion gene is 531 bp, of which 471 bp is an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 156-amino acid peptide, and 60 bp is a 3'-untranslated region with the polyadenylation sequence AATAAA and a poly(A) tail. The ubiquitin-fusion protein includes an ubiquitin monomer of 76 amino acids with a 6-amino acid motif (LRLRGG) and 3 conserved lysine functional sites, which participate in the formation of the ubiquitin-protease complex. The ubiquitin-fusion protein also contains an 80-amino acid carboxyl extension protein, namely, ribosomal protein S27 with a classical zinc finger motif C-X(4)-C-X(14)-C-X(2)-C. Because of its carboxyl extension protein S27, the M. domestica ubiquitin-fusion protein was named Mub(S27). It has a predicted molecular weight of 18 kDa and a theoretical isoelectric point of 9.82. No signal peptides were predicted for the protein. Northern blot analysis revealed that Mub(S27) transcript level is higher at the embryo stage than that at any other developmental stages. When houseflies develop into 5-day pupae, the Ub mRNA level is relatively low. After infection with gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, Mub(S27) transcript level was upregulated. Mub(S27) transcript level was also regulated by heat or cold stress. ;alanine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
1654338;Connective tissue growth factor: a cysteine-rich mitogen secreted by human vascular endothelial cells is related to the SRC-induced immediate early gene product CEF-10.;Human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells have been previously reported to express the genes for the A and B chains of PDGF and to secrete PDGF-related factors into culture media. Antihuman PDGF IgG affinity chromatography was used to purify PDGF-related activity from HUVE cell-conditioned media. Immunoblot analysis of the affinity-purified proteins with anti-PDGF IgG and antibodies specific for the A or B chain peptides of PDGF combined with chemotactic and mitogenic assays revealed that the major PDGF immunorelated molecule secreted by HUVE cells is a monomer of approximately 36-38 kD and that less than 10% of the purified biologically active molecules are PDGF A or B chain peptides. Screening of an HUVE cell cDNA library in the expression vector lambda gtl 1 with the anti-PDGF antibody resulted in the cloning and sequencing of a cDNA with an open reading frame encoding a 38-kD cysteine-rich secreted protein which we show to be the major PDGF-related mitogen secreted by human vascular endothelial cells. The protein has a 45% overall homology to the translation product of the v-src-induced CEF-10 mRNA from chick embryo fibroblasts. We have termed this new mitogen connective tissue growth factor.;cysteine;-;-;LCR_without_function

The latency periods ranged from 6 to 18 months. The BKV etiology of tumors was supported by detection of BKV T antigen in cells of established tumor lines by means of indirect immunofluorescence. No tumors appeared in animals given injections of saline instead of virus. BKV T antibodies were detected in sera of 100 per cent of animals bearing tumors but no in sera of control animals. Only 3 of 77 BKV infected and none of the control animals developed spontaneous tumors (adenomas).;-;antigen;-;hard_2

26366920;Omnidirectional absorption and off-resonance field enhancement in dielectric cylinders coated with graphene layers.;We investigate electromagnetic scattering and absorption by dielectric cylinders coated with a concentric plasmonic shell at arbitrary incidence angles. Exploiting bulk and surface plasmon resonances in the long wavelength regime, we obtain an analytical condition to achieve wide-angle enhanced absorption for both TE and TM polarizations. By using the Lorenz-Mie theory, we apply this result to investigate electromagnetic absorption in a silicon cylinder coated with a graphene monolayer epitaxially grown on silicon carbide. Our theoretical results show that enhanced absorption occurs for a broad frequency range in the terahertz, and that omnidirectional absorption exists at a frequency in between the bulk and localized surface plasmon resonances. By showing that omnidirectional absorption does not correspond to an extinction resonance, we associate this phenomenon with off-resonance field enhancement in this system, which in turn is explained in terms of Fano resonances in the graphene layer.;-;-;-;hard_0
7400035;Intracellular processing of procollagen induced by the action of colchicine.;Corium fragments incubated in vitro with colchicine or obtained from chick embryos 11 days old after in vivo injection of this alkaloid were studied with the electron microscope. The well known effect of colchicine in producing an accumulation of procollagen was demonstrated by electrophoretic separation of the collagenous products in polyacrylamide gels after incubation of corium fragments in vitro with labelled amino acids. Electron microscopical studies showed various types of cytoplasmic vacuoles containing collagenous fibrillar structures. Some of these vacuoles contained non-striated filaments, fibres with the periodicity of native collagen, and segment long spacing (SLS) crystallites, embedded in an electrondense substance. The central aspect of this communication is the finding of intracellular SLS in cytoplasmic vacuoles. These crystallites were morphologically intact, and had no additional bands at the NH2 or COOH ends, suggesting that they were formed by the aggregation of tropocollagen molecules. Since the presence of intact SLS in cytoplasmic vacuoles suggests that these are secretory, we believe that inhibition of the transcellular transport system by colchicine permitted the visualization of vacuoles containing the products of tropocollagen interconversions. We interpret these findings as an example of autophagocytosis, with intracellular processing of procollagen, occurring in chick embryo fibroblasts when the secretion of procollagen is inhibited by colchicine.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
11691940;Evaluation of complexation of metal-mediated DNA-binding drugs to oligonucleotides via electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.;The interactions of self-complementary oligonucleotides with a group of metal-mediated DNA-binding drugs, including chromomycin A(3), mithramycin and the novel compound UK-1, were examined via electrospray ionization quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometry. Both chromomycin and mithramycin were shown to bind preferentially to GC-rich oligonucleotide duplexes in a 2:1 drug:metal ratio, while UK-1 was shown to bind in a 1:1 drug:metal stoichiometric ratio without a strong sequence preference. These trends were observed in the presence of Co(2+), Ni(2+) and Zn(2+), with the exception that chromomycin-Zn(2+) complexes were not readily observed. The binding stoichiometries as well as the sequence specificities are in agreement with literature reports for solution studies. Binding selectivities and stabilities of the complexes were also probed using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Both of the GC-rich oligomers 5'-GCGCGC-3' and 5'-GCGCATGCGC-3' exhibited a binding preference for chromomycin over mithramycin in the presence of Co(2+) and Ni(2+). Energy-variable collisionally activated dissociation of the complexes was employed to determine the stabilities of the complexes. The relative metal-dependent binding energies were Ni(2+) > Zn(2+) > Co(2+) for UK-1-oligomer complexes and Ni(2+) > Co(2+) for both mithramycin and chromomycin complexes. ;cysteine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
6179947;Mouse DNA replicase. DNA polymerase associated with a novel RNA polymerase activity to synthesize initiator RNA of strict size.;"De novo DNA synthesis on poly(dT) by a novel mouse DNA polymerase, here named ""DNA replicase,"" was examined for the synthesis of RNA which functions as a primer in the subsequent synthesis of DNA. As has been reported previously (Yagura, T., Kozu, T., and Seno, T. (1982) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 91, 607-618), a novel RNA polymerase activity, which is distinguished from those of classical RNA polymerases, is associated with DNA replicase. The synthesis of RNA and DNA by DNA replicase (Mr = 16 X 10(4), by glycerol gradient sedimentation analysis) was greatly stimulated by a specific stimulating factor (Mr = 13 X 10(4), by glycerol gradient sedimentation analysis) which was found to consist of two subunits (Mr = 63 X 10(3), by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). Nearest neighbor analysis in which transfer of 32P from alpha-labeled nucleoside triphosphates to ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides was examined, showed th at RNA of 8-10 nucleotides long was covalently linked to the 5'-end of the DNA product molecule. This RNA, named initiator RNA, had a triphosphate group at its 5' terminus and its size and synthesis were little affected by the addition of high concentrations of deoxynucleoside triphosphate, while in these conditions deoxyribonucleotides were incorporated into initiator RNA to a limited extent. The characteristics of the DNA replicase and stimulating factor that cooperate to synthesize initiator RNA for subsequent DNA synthesis on single-stranded DNA are important because these components seem to be involved in a reaction required to initiate the synthesis of discontinuous earliest DNA intermediates (Okazaki fragments) in chromosomal DNA replication of eukaryotic cells.";-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
3515176;Biochemical properties of larval excretory-secretory glycoproteins of the parasitic nematode Toxocara canis.;Toxocara canis larvae, infective to Man, secrete a number of antigenic macromolecules into culture medium over prolonged periods of time. These antigens have been collected and characterised with respect to molecular weight by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis following extrinsic and intrinsic radiolabelling, or electrophoresis followed by gel staining or immunoblotting. Panels of enzymes and lectins have been applied to examine protease sensitivity and carbohydrate composition, respectively, and a number of other biochemical data have been noted. Taken together, the excretory-secretory molecules contain more than 40% carbohydrate of which the majority is N-acetylgalactosamine and galactose. The individual antigens may readily be separated by gel filtration on a Sepharose 6B column, and it is shown that the major excretory-secretory macromolecules are all glycoproteins which differ in essential characteristics. For example, the 32 kDa antigen (TES-32) binds concanavalin A, is sensitive to a range of proteases and is the band most readily stained by silver and Coomassie blue. Both TES-120 and TES-400 components are resistant to tryptic or peptic cleavage, bind to Helix pomatia lectin and stain with periodic acid-Schiff, yet unlike TES-120, TES-400 does not incorporate radioactive methionine nor can it be stained by silver stain techniques. Finally, one protease, staphylococcal V8, reveals cleavage sites only in the TES-70 and TES-400 molecules.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
3259722;Biochemical purification of various receptor molecules involved in human T lymphocyte activation. Separation of 9.3 antigen from the T cell receptor for antigen.;The now classical major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted receptor for antigen on human T lymphocytes has been identified as a 90 kDa disulphide-linked heterodimer composed of two glycoproteins termed alpha and beta. More recently, another type of T cell receptor for antigen has been described, which seems to mediate killing of target cells without any obvious requirement for MHC recognition. This T cell receptor for antigen is also a heterodimer composed of gamma, delta chains non-covalently associated with the three mon morphic CD3 subunits. Another disulphide-linked dimer capable of triggering T lymphocytes has been defined recently by a monoclonal antibody: the anti-human 9.3 antigen. In order to generate monoclonal or polyclonal reagents against variable and constant regions of the T cell receptor chains and against new epitopes of the 9.3 antigen, we have developed a biochemical method of purification of T lymphocyte disulphide-linked dimers. Our method relies on two biochemical properties of the 9.3 surface molecule and the T cell receptor for antigen. (1) They are disulphide-linked dimers and thus can be separated from the vast majority of the cell surface molecules by two-dimensional (non-reduced versus reduced) sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). (2) T cell receptor chains are less hydrophobic than the 9.3 antigen, and thus can be isolated from it on reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) at a lower concentration of acetonitrile. Microsomal preparations from T cell clones and leukaemia lines were prepared by nitrocavitation and lysed in sodium deoxycholate. After concentration, this lysate was electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE in non-reducing conditions. The gel slice corresponding to the molecular weight of the T cell receptor was cut out and run in reducing conditions in the second dimension. The T cell receptor spots were easily located on the gel by autoradiography as the microsomal lysate had been mixed with iodinated glycoproteins. The T cell receptor was eluted from the gel with about 85% yield. At this stage, the T cell receptor preparations also contained the 9.3 antigen, another disulphide-linked dimer. The separation of this antigen from the T cell receptor chains had been achieved on reverse-phase HPLC. This procedure allows the purification and separation of two disulphide-linked dimers which are both involved in T cell activation. The obtention of antibodies against new epitopes of these important molecules would be extremely useful for analysing their role in T cell function and ontogeny.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
6190419;An improved method for separation of low-molecular-weight polypeptides by electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel.;An improved system for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, capable of analyzing polypeptides having molecular weights from 1500 to 100,000 (especially showing high resolving power in the 1500 to 25,000 molecular weight range) is described. The 10 to 18% linear gradient gel containing 7 M urea with an acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio of 20:1 and the Laemmli discontinuous buffer was used. The use of the gel with a high crosslinkage ratio is shown to be effective in lowering the leakage of low-molecular-weight polypeptides from the gel. This method has facilitated rapid detection of small amounts of low-molecular-weight polypeptides in body fluids by the use of silver stain. A procedure is presented for the elimination of false bands on the gel frequently encountered during silver staining. The separation patterns of enzymatic cleavage products of proteins, uremic plasma, and urines from nephropathy patients are illustrated. This system is also applicable in the separation of lipopolysaccharides and also for the detection of phospholipids.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
9172722;[Positioning trauma in anesthesia and surgical intensive care medicine (2)].;Specific modes of positioning are essential for successful surgery. These are again critically assessed in this final part of our review. Technically correct execution can minimize the risk of damage caused by positioning, although the possibility of damage still exists. First of all, the position on the fracture table is discussed. Great care must be taken concerning the perineal post and leg holder. In the lateral decubitus position, the correct positioning of head and spine as well as that of the lower arm are of great importance. When using the Trendelenburg and reverse Trendelenburg position, the effect on the cardiopulmonary system and the intracranial pressure must to be taken into consideration. Prone position and its modifications (i.e. tuck position) demand diligent care concerning the positioning of the head. There must be absolutely no bulbus compression and the abdominal wall should not be under pressure. While employing the sitting position, the patient should be adequately monitored so that venous air embolism can be recognized and treated as soon as possible. Because of the increased occurrence of grave complications, the sitting position should be used only if this is absolutely necessary.;-;-;-;hard_0

Antigens were used that possess enzymic activities and the efficiency of antigen binding was determined from the enzymic activity of the matrix-bound immunocomplexes. High-performance immunoaffinity purification using Eupergit C beads proved to be highly specific, reproducible, free from protein leakage and possessed a low degree of non-specific adsorption of tissue proteins. These characteristics of the system were illustrated by the isolation of immunoglobulin G from serum and of human decidua proteins from the decidua tissue and from seminal plasma.

2185139;Analysis and nucleotide sequence of an origin of DNA replication in Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and its use for Escherichia coli shuttle plasmids.;A shuttle plasmid for Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Escherichia coli has been constructed from a cryptic A. calcoaceticus lwoffi plasmid and pBR322. It is transformed to A. calcoaceticus BD413 by natural competency, yielding about 10(6) transformants per microgram of plasmid DNA. The ApR and TcR genes of pBR322 are functional in A. calcoaceticus. A gene bank was constructed from chromosomal A. calcoaceticus DNA and the shuttle plasmid. Direct transformation to A. calcoaceticus yielded about 95% recombinants, indicating a sixfold enrichment of recombinant plasmids compared to E. coli. One clone complementing a trpE mutation carried a 20-kb insertion and transformed with a 30-fold higher efficiency when compared to the vector. A deletion analysis of the shuttle plasmid indicates that 2.2 kb is necessary for autonomous replication and stable maintenance in A. calcoaceticus. No rearrangements of the DNA or loss of plasmids are found in that organism, even in the absence of selective pressure, when this sequence is present. A further insertional inactivation analysis creating lacZ transcriptional fusions suggests that the origin of replication (ori) is contained within about 1350 bp. Analysis of beta-galactosidase production in A. calcoaceticus indicates that only a weak promoter activity is directed out of one end of this ori. Its sequence contains A + T-rich regions, an 18-bp element with nearly perfect palindromic symmetry and eleven repeats of the consensus sequence, AAAAAATAT, eight of which are clustered within 360 bp.

10448078;ZBP-99 defines a conserved family of transcription factors and regulates ornithine decarboxylase gene expression.;Among transcription factors that regulate ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) gene expression are those that interact with GC-rich promoters, including Sp1 and ZBP-89. Sp1 functions as a transactivator and ZBP-89 as a transrepressor of both the ODC and gastrin promoters. This study reports the cloning and characterization of a second member of the ZBP family that also binds GC boxes. ZBP-99 contains four Krüppel-type zinc fingers that collectively share 91% amino acid sequence similarity and 79% sequence identity with those found in ZBP-89. In addition, there are highly conserved amino acid sequences in the carboxy-terminal segments of the two genes. In spite of their structural similarities, the two proteins are encoded at distinct loci, ZBP-89 on chromosome 3q21 and ZBP-99 on 1q32.1. The predicted open reading frame of ZBP-99 cDNA encodes a 99-kDa protein. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that ZBP-99 protein specifically binds to the GC-rich promoter elements of gastrin and ODC genes. Northern blot analysis showed that a major ZBP-99 transcript of 5.6 kb is expressed ubiquitously at low levels, with elevated expression levels in placenta and in adult kidney, liver, and lymphocytes. Cotransfection of AGS gastric adenocarcinoma and HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma cells with a ZBP-99 expression construct and with an ODC reporter construct show that ZBP-99 repressed basal expression in the two cell lines by 80 and 60%, respectively. Collectively, the data suggest that ZBP-99 binds GC-rich promoters and may complement the activities mediated by ZBP-89. ;cysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
11825960;Diagnosis of human leptospirosis by monoclonal antibody-based antigen detection in urine.;Hybridomas secreting specific monoclonal antibodies (MAb) to all members of the genus Leptospira (clone LF9) and those that are specific only to the pathogenic species (clones LD5 and LE1) were produced. MAb LF9, which was immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1), reacted to a 38-kDa component of the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-separated whole-cell lysates of all Leptospira spp., while MAb LD5 and MAb LE1, which were IgG1 and IgG2a, respectively, reacted to the 35- to 36-kDa components of all serogroups of the pathogenic species of LEPTOSPIRA: The MAb LD5 was used in a dot blot-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dot-ELISA) for detecting Leptospira antigen in urine samples serially collected from two groups of patients diagnosed with leptospirosis, i.e., 36 clinically diagnosed patients and 25 Leptospira culture confirmed patients. Their serum samples were tested serologically by IgM Dipstick assay, indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and/or microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Urine samples of 26 patients diagnosed with other illnesses and 120 healthy individuals served as controls. For the first group of patients, who had been ill for an average of 3.4 days before hospitalization, the IgM Dipstick test, IFA, and MAT were positive for 69.4, 70.0, and 85.7% of patients, while the Leptospira antigenuria tested by the MAb-based dot-ELISA was positive for 75.0, 88.9, 97.2, 97.2, and 100% of patients on days 1, 2, 3, 7, and 14 of hospitalization, respectively. All but 1 of 11 patients whose serum samples collected on the first day of hospitalization were IgM seronegative, were positive by urine antigen test on day 1. This is strong evidence that detection of antigen in urine can provide diagnostic information that could be useful in directing early therapeutic intervention. The MAT was positive in 10 of 12 patients (83.3%) of the 25 culture-positive Leptospira patients who had been ill for an average of 5.04 days before hospitalization, and the Leptospira antigen was found in 64.0, 84.0, 96.0, 100, 100, 100, and 100% of the patients' urine samples collected on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of hospitalization, respectively. Leptospira antigenuria was found in 3 of the 26 patients diagnosed with other illnesses and 1 of the 120 healthy controls. The reasons for this positivity are discussed. The detection of antigen in urine by the monoclonal antibody-based dot-ELISA has high potential for rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnosis of leptospirosis at a low cost.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
1662409;Preparation and partial characterization of a pancreatic cancer-associated glycoprotein expressing CA50.;"In our previous study, two antigens associated with pancreatic cancer were prepared from ascites of the patients by using a newly developed affinity chromatography technique; one expressed CA19-9, CA50, Span-1, sialyl SSEA-1, and Dupan-2. This report describes the other part of the antigens, which was scarcely found in normal sera. This antigen was a glycoprotein with a high molecular weight of 1,000,000 in its native state, estimated by size exclusion chromatography on Sephacryl S400. After sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotting analysis, the antigenic activity was observed on the 200-Kd band, and monoclonal antibody of CA50 showed intense reactivity to it. By means of an enzyme immunoassay, CA19-9 determinant was also recognized on it to a lesser extent, although sialyl SSEA-1 and Dupan-2 determinants were scarcely observed. From these observations, the present antigen was considered to be a serum glycoprotein carrying type-1 polylactosamine determinant and differs from previously reported glycoprotein carrying CA19-9 in its insolubility in perchloric acid solution because of its lesser degree of glycosilation. Serum levels of the antigen measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated that highly positive rates were observed in 78% of pancreatic cancers, 82% of biliary tract cancers, and 96% of hepatocellular carcinomas.";-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
9349753;Partial purification and localization of platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase from bovine seminal plasma.;Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potent lipid mediator that is inactivated by platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH). Platelet-activating factor bioactivity has been detected in bovine sperm phospholipids and PAF-AH activity is extraordinarily high in bovine seminal plasma. The purpose of this study was to purify and characterize partially the PAF-AH in bovine seminal plasma. Platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase was partially purified from bovine seminal plasma using gelatin-agarose and ion-exchange chromatography and nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Enzyme activity was increased 11-fold over seminal plasma with a yield of 11%. Platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase activity was eluted from a single band with a R(f) of 0.258 from a nondenaturing preparative PAGE gel along with several other proteins of varying molecular weights. Following separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-PAGE under reducing conditions, PAF-AH was identified as a approximately 60-kD band by western blotting using antiserum directed against human blood PAF-AH. N-terminal sequencing of the approximately 60 kD band, followed by amino acid-sequence similarity searching, demonstrated a single-sequence match with PAF-AH from bovine blood. Based on western blotting, a approximately 60-kD band corresponding to PAF-AH was detected in seminal vesicle fluid but not in samples of washed, sonicated sperm or sperm plasma membranes where activity was low (<5% and <0.3%, respectively, of that in seminal plasma), suggesting that seminal plasma PAF-AH does not bind tightly to sperm. Specific PAF-AH activity measured in seminal vesicle fluid was in the lower range of that in seminal plasma. These results demonstrate that PAF-AH activity in bovine seminal plasma is due to PAF-AH secreted by the seminal vesicles with sequence homology to the enzyme in human blood.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
1663029;A secreted 80 x 10(3) Mr protein mediates sensing of cell density and the onset of development in Dictyostelium.;In submerged monolayer culture, Dictyostelium cells can differentiate into prespore and prestalk cells at high cell densities in response to cAMP but not at low cell densities. However, cells at low densities will differentiate in medium taken from developing cells starved at a high density. The putative factor in the medium was designated CMF for conditioned medium factor (Mehdy and Firtel, Molec. cell. Biology 5, 705-713, 1985). In this report, we size-fractionate conditioned medium and show that the activity that allows low density cells to differentiate can be separated into high and low Mr (relative molecular mass) fractions. Interestingly, the two fractions both have the same activity and do not need to be combined to allow differentiation. The large conditioned medium factor is a protein, as determined by trypsin sensitivity, that can be purified to a single 80 x 10(3) Mr band on a silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and has CMF activity at a concentration of approximately 4 pM (0.3 ng ml-1). Our results suggest that CMF is a secreted factor that functions in vivo as an indicator of cell density in starved cells. At high cell densities, the concentration of CMF is sufficient to enable cells to enter the multicellular stage of the developmental cycle. When present below a threshold concentration, cells do not initiate the expression of genes required for early development. This factor plays an essential role in the regulatory pathway necessary for cells to obtain the developmental competence to induce prestalk and prespore gene expression in response to cAMP.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
15955317;Entamoeba histolytica: cloning and expression of the poly(A) polymerase EhPAP.;In eukaryotes, polyadenylation of pre-mRNA 3' end is essential for mRNA export, stability, and translation. Here we identified and cloned a gene codifying for a putative nuclear poly(A) polymerase (EhPAP) in Entamoeba histolytica. Protein sequence alignments with eukaryotic PAPs showed that EhPAP has the RNA-binding region and the PAP central domain with the catalytic nucleotidyl transferase domain described for other nuclear PAPs. Recombinant EhPAP expressed in bacteria was used to generate specific antibodies, which recognized two EhPAP isoforms of 60 and 63kDa in nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts by Western blot assays. RT-PCR assays showed that EhPap mRNA expression varies in multidrug-resistant trophozoites growing in different emetine concentrations. Moreover, EhPap mRNA expression is about 10- and 7-fold increased in G1 and S phase, respectively, through cell cycle progression. These results suggest the existence of a link between EhPAP expression and MDR and cell cycle regulation, respectively. ;alanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
7764456;Kinetic resistance to anticancer agents.;Adherent epithelial cancer cells, such as colon cancer cells, are much more resistant to anthracyclines and to many other major anticancer agents when the cell population reaches confluence. Our purpose is to analyze the mechanisms of this confluence dependent resistance (CDR) that is probably the major cause of the natural resistance of solid tumors to chemotherapy. Some drugs (anthracyclines, etoposide and vincristine) but not others (cisplatin, melphalan and 5-fluorouracil) accumulate less in confluent than in nonconfluent cells. A decrease of the passive transmembrane drug transport in confluent cells is associated to a reduced membrane fluidity. However, the predominant mechanism of CDR is an increase in the intrinsic resistance of the DNA to the drug-induced damage. This mechanism is now relatively well understood for anthracyclines and etoposide that act mainly through an inhibition of the topoisomerase II: as the enzyme level is low in slowly proliferating confluent cells, the number of drug-induced DNA strand breaks is lower than in rapidly growing nonconfluent cells which highly express the topoisomerase II gene. Mechanisms of CDR for the other drugs are less clear and could involve an increase in the ability to repair damaged DNA. Attempts to circumvent CDR could consist in the stimulation of the cell proliferation by hormones or growth factors, or in the recruitment of quiescent cells into the S and G2 phases by previous treatment of confluent cells with infratoxic concentration of DNA-damaging agents.;-;-;-;hard_0
379978;Concanvalin-A-binding proteins on the surface of human malignant and normal lymphocytes.;The concanavalin-A-binding cell surface glycoproteins from normal and certain leukaemic human lymphocytes were radiolabelled and then solubilized with detergent, isolated by affinity chromatography on Con A insolubilized on agarose beads, and subsequently analysed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Leukaemic T cells from patients with Sezary syndrome were found to express major concanavalin-A-binding glycoproteins on their outer surface similar to those of normal T lymphocytes. Leukaemic B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia expressed Con-A-binding proteins similar to those of B-cell lines. HLA antigens were predominant among the major Con-A-binding proteins on the surface of the normal and the malignant T cells studied. Human Ia-like antigens, HLA antigens, and the cell surface immunoglobulins IgD and IgM represented the major Con-A-binding proteins on the B cells studied. beta 2-microglobulin was found associated with HLA antigens on both leukaemic and non-leukaemic T and B cells. The presence of additional Con-A-binding proteins expressed on the surface of the different cell types studied is discussed along with some physical characteristics of the human Ia-like antigens isolated.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
6794637;Fractionation of individual, biologically active factor VIII multimers.;We have designed an electrophoretic system for the fractionation of individual, biologically active multimers of factor VIII. Human factor VIII, purified by gel filtration on Sepharose CL-2B from plasma cryoprecipitate, was submitted to electrophoresis without SDS on 2.0% polyacrylamide gels in 0.04 M Tris/0.06 M Tes buffer, pH 7.5. Staining with Coomassie blue revealed a series of protein bands. Measurement of electrophoretic mobility showed constant size intervals between adjacent bands. Electrophoresis in a second dimension, in the presence of SDS, resulted in an identical order of mobilities, suggesting that the different migration rates of factor VIII proteins in the first electrophoretic system were size- and not charge-dependent. After electrophoresis in the absence of SDS both factor VIII coagulant and ristocetin cofactor activities as well as factor VIII-related antigen were recovered by elution from gel slices. The distribution of activity peaks resembled that of Coomassie-stained factor VIII proteins found in control gels. We thus demonstrate that an electrophoretic fractionation of factor VIII multimers is possible even at neutral pH where factor VIII activities are retained.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
19107569;Feed supplementation prevents post-conception decline in milk progesterone concentrations associated with production stress in dairy buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis).;"The onset of pregnancy may be associated with hormonal changes and decline in milk yield of buffaloes. To investigate this, forty lactating buffaloes from 1st to 23rd weeks post-conception were selected. The animals were assigned to three treatments: PRT, PRS, NPRT and three milk yielding groups HMY, 66 to 75 l/week, n = 12; MMY, 56 to 65 l/week, n = 16; LMY, 46 to 55 l/week, n = 12). Milk samples were collected on alternate weeks and analyzed with ultrasonic milk analyzer. EIA was used for milk progesterone concentrations. Group means were compared and correlation analysis was conducted. Progesterone concentrations increased in almost similar pattern with the advancing weeks post-conception. The high and low yielder showed greater progesterone concentrations in the supplemented than the animals on traditional ration (P < 0.001). Progesterone concentrations correlated positively with fat (%), negatively with milk yield, protein (%) and lactose (%). Decline in milk yield became drastic when progesterone concentrations rose above 6.44 ng/ml. The pregnant animals on traditional ration exhibited a sharper decline in milk yield with the increasing progesterone concentrations as compared to pregnant animals with supplemented ration. It is concluded that concentrates supplementation induced a raise in progesterone levels. Progesterone concentrations and milk yield showed an inverse relationship.";-;-;-;hard_0
2423817;The effect of aging on the structure and function of liver messenger RNA.;The size of the poly(A) segment of poly(A)+RNA extracted from hepatocytes isolated from 4- to 30-month-old rats was determined using polyacrylamide-agarose gel electrophoresis. The average size of the poly(A) segment isolated from newly synthesized poly(A)+RNA was 150 nucleotides, and the average size of the poly(A) segment isolated from the steady state pool of cytoplasmic poly(A)+RNA was 70 nucleotides. No significant age related change in either the size or the heterogeneity of the newly synthesized poly(A) segment was found. The translational activity of poly(A)+RNA isolated from livers of 4- to 30-month-old rats was determined using wheat germ extract and rabbit reticulocyte lysate cell-free systems. No age-related change in the translational activity of the poly(A)+RNA was observed. The effect of aging on the cap structure was also studied by measuring the inhibition of cell-free translation by 7-methyl guanosine-5'-monophosphate. No age-related change in the sensitivity of the poly(A)+RNA preparations to inhibition of translation by 7-methyl guanosine-5'-monophosphate was observed. Therefore, the results of this study demonstrate that no major age-related change occurs in the structure of the poly(A) segment, the translational activity, or the cap structure of poly(A)+RNA from rat liver.;alanine;-;polyacrylamide;LCR_with_hard
500205;Relationship of genotype of recombinants of influenza A/Hong Kong/68-ts-1[E]virus used as live virus vaccines to virulence in humans.;Influenza A/Hong Kong/68-ts-1[E] virus is a temperature-sensitive mutant developed for use as a live virus vaccine (B. R. Murphy, E. G. Chalhub, S. R. Nusinoff, J. Kasel, and R. M. Chanock, J. Infect. Dis. 128:479--487, 1973). This virus and temperature-sensitive recombinants derived by mating it with A/Udorn/72, A/Georgia/74, or A/Victoria/75 wild-type virus have been administered to volunteers in clinical trials on the assumption that the ts-1[E] temperature-sensitive genetic lesions on a polymerase gene (P3) and on the nucleoprotein gene (NP) would determine a satisfactory and reproducible level of attentuation regardless of the genetic constitution of ts-1[E] recombinants at other loci (B. R. Murphy, D. D. Richman, S. B. Spring, and R. M. Chanock, Postgrad. Med. 52:381--388, 1976). In this paper, the parental origin of genes in the ts-1[E] recombinants was determined by using the technique of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of virion ribonucleic acid segments in the presence of a denaturing agent (urea). When tested in individuals who lacked immunity to hemagglutinin antigen, attenuation of the ts-1[E] recombinants appeared to correlate with inheritance of the ts-1[E] temperature-sensitive genes at the P3 and NP loci and with the level of preinfection neuraminidase immunity. There was no evidence that other genes from the ts-1[E] donor virus played a role in attenuation.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3

In order to understand how these proteins are inserted and anchored in the bilayer, we have cloned several of the major A. laidlawii proteins in Escherichia coli: 900 recombinant clones containing 4-kbp DNA fragments, inserted into the BamHI site of the plasmid pAT 153, were screened with antibodies. With antimembrane antibodies, 26 positive clones were detected, and with a mixture of five different monospecific antibodies, another 7 clones were obtained. Immunological analysis of the colonies in situ verified that antigens for A. laidlawii membrane proteins D12, T2, T3, T4a, and unidentified proteins were produced in separate clones. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by immunoblotting showed several fragments [25 to 94 kilodalton (kDa)] for each of these proteins, some of which were even visible on Coomassie Blue-stained gels. It is concluded that A. laidlawii membrane proteins can be efficiently expressed in E. coli.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3

17996343;Atmospheric NH3 as plant nutrient: a case study with Brassica oleracea.;Nutrient-sufficient and nitrate- or sulfate-deprived plants of Brassica oleracea L. were exposed to 4 microl l(-1) NH3 (2.8 mg m(-3)), and effects on biomass production and allocation, N-compounds and root morphology investigated. Nitrate-deprived plants were able to transfer to atmospheric NH3 as nitrogen source, but biomass allocation in favor of the root was not changed by exposure to NH3. NH3 reduced the difference in total root length between nitrate-sufficient and nitrate-deprived plants, and increased the specific root length in the latter. The internal N status, therefore, might be involved in controlling root length in B. oleracea. Root surface area, volume and diameter were unaffected by both nitrate deprivation and NH3 exposure. In sulfate-deprived plants an inhibitory effect of NH3 on root morphological parameters was observed. These plants, therefore, might be more susceptible to atmospheric NH3 than nitrate-deprived plants. The relevance of the present data under field conditions is discussed.;-;-;-;hard_0
9366770;Increased intracellular cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate inhibits release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha from human vascular tissue and cultured smooth muscle cells.;"OBJECTIVES
We recently reported that bacterial lipopolysaccharide stimulates release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha from both human vascular tissue and cultured smooth muscle cells. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that increased intracellular cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) could inhibit TNF-alpha release.


DESIGN
Prospective, repeated-measures analysis.


SETTING
Academic research laboratory.


SUBJECTS
Segments of internal mammary artery and saphenous vein from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery.


MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS
Segments of saphenous vein and internal mammary artery and confluent smooth muscle cells cultured from these vessels were incubated in the presence of 20 micrograms/mL bacterial lipopolysaccharide, alone or with the addition of forskolin or 8-Br-cAMP. At 0, 1, 3, 6, 18, and 24 hrs, the incubation medium was removed from vessel segments or cells and was analyzed for biologically active TNF-alpha, using the L929 cell cytotoxicity assay. cAMP was extracted from tissue and cells with 0.1 N HCl and was analyzed by radioimmunoassay. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide stimulated the release of TNF-alpha from internal mammary smooth muscle cells at all time points. For example, at 6 hrs, TNF-alpha concentration in the medium from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cells was 20 +/- 1.6 U/mg of cell protein, compared with 0.9 +/- 0.5 U/mg of cell protein in control cell medium (p < .05). Forskolin-inhibited bacterial lipopolysaccharide stimulated TNF-alpha release. In the presence of lipopolysaccharide and forskolin, TNF-alpha release at 6 hrs was 8.6 +/- 1.5 U/mg of cell protein (p < .05 vs. in the presence of bacterial lipopolysaccharide alone). Bacterial lipopolysaccharide, alone, had no effect on intracellular cAMP. Forskolin increased intracellular cAMP levels to 74.0 +/- 12 pmol/mg of cell protein at 6 hrs from a control level of 7.7 +/- 0.4 pmol/mg (p < .05). The 8-Br-cAMP, an agent that mimics the action of intracellular cAMP, also inhibited TNF-alpha release stimulated by lipopolysaccharide. Similar inhibition by forskolin and 8-Br-cAMP on TNF-alpha release was obtained with smooth muscle cells from saphenous vein. Finally, in tissue segments from either internal mammary artery or saphenous vein, both forskolin and 8-Br-cAMP inhibited lipopolysaccharide-stimulated TNF-alpha release.


CONCLUSIONS
These results are consistent with the conclusion that vascular tissue, particularly the smooth muscle cell, is a source of TNF-alpha. Further, bacterial lipopolysaccharide-stimulated tumor TNF-alpha release can be inhibited by increased intracellular cAMP.";-;-;-;hard_0
9520495;The Black-Scholes pricing formula in the quantum context.;A natural explanation for extreme irregularities in the evolution of prices in financial markets is provided by quantum effects. The lack of simultaneous observability of relevant variables and the interference of attempted observation with the values of these variables represent such effects. These characteristics have been noted by traders and economists and appear intrinsic to market dynamics. This explanation is explored here in terms of a corresponding generalization of the Wiener process and its role in the Black-Scholes-Merton theory. The differentiability of the Wiener process as a sesquilinear form on a dense domain in the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions over Wiener space is shown and is extended to the quantum context. This provides a basis for a corresponding generalization of the Ito theory of stochastic integration. An extension of the Black-Scholes option pricing formula to the quantum context is deduced.;-;-;-;hard_0
7195381;Immunoglobulin E-containing cells in mouse lung following allergen inhalation and ozone exposure.;Cells containing immunoglobulin E (IgE) were enumerated and their location in mouse lungs was determined by direct immunofluorescence. Lungs were studied from mice that had been immunized with aerosolized ovalbumin as well as from normal mice and from mice that were exposed to ozone (0.5 or 0.8 ppm) prior to receiving aerosolized antigen. In addition, some mice were immunized intraperitoneally with ovalbumin precipitated in alum. IgE-containing cells were primarily airway-related in normal mice and in mice immunized by the intraperitoneal route. Lungs from aerosol-immunized, and aerosol-immunized ozone-exposed mice showed a more disseminated distribution of IgE-containing cells. Fluorescent cells were counted and numbers were expressed as total cells per square millimeter of lung tissue and as airway-associated cells per millimeter of airway. Total IgE cells increased 9.4-fold in mice that received aerosolized ovalbumin as compared to normal mice. When ozone exposure was added to the effects from aerosolized ovalbumin, the increase of IgE cells over normal was 34.2-fold. IgE cell counts correlated well with anaphylactic sensitivity to intravenous challenge with ovalbumin. The observed enhancement of allergic sensitization by ozone exposure has important implications for human health.;-;antigen;-;hard_2

In fetuses, euglobulin clot lysis time (ECLT) was significantly shortened, plasminogen level was low and histidine-rich glycoprotein undetectable. While t-PA and u-PA levels were slightly lower than in adult controls, a significant decrease in PAI activity was demonstrated and no PAI-2 could be detected in fetal plasma.

9407423;Are angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors superior to beta blockers in retarding progressive renal function decline?;We questioned the superiority of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to beta blocking drugs with regard to renal function outcome in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency and normal to moderately elevated blood pressure (BP). We therefore studied 89 patients in a prospective double-blind randomized trial comparing the effect of enalapril and atenolol on the slope of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Mean baseline GFR was 53 +/- 20 ml/min, untreated BP 152 +/- 20 mm Hg systolic and 90 +/- 11 mm Hg diastolic and median proteinuria 0.6 g/24 hr (interquartile range 0.0 to 2.5). After a run-in period without antihypertensives, the test drug was titrated to lower diastolic BP to a predefined goal of 10 mm Hg below baseline and/or below 95 mm Hg. The median follow up was 3.9 years. Antihypertensive therapy resulted in a comparable decrease of BP in both study groups. Filtration fraction and proteinuria decreased in both groups. The slope of GFR over time was not different between both groups (-1.39 +/- 2.82 and -1.97 +/- 3.38 ml/min/year on atenolol and enalapril, respectively). In multiple regression analysis a higher baseline GFR, a greater decrease in GFR and in proteinuria during titration and a lower proteinuria during follow up were independently related to a better GFR slope. We conclude that the use of ACE inhibitors is not imperative in all patients with non-diabetic nephropathy.;-;-;-;hard_0
6381502;Generation of monoclonal antibodies to RNA polymerase II for the identification of transcriptional factors.;"Monoclonal antibodies were raised against a partially purified RNA polymerase II preparation from hen oviduct. Hybridomas were screened using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and those producing antibodies against the RNA polymerase II preparation were cloned twice. The specificity of monoclonal antibodies for RNA polymerase II was determined by three types of assays: first, by immunoblot assay; second, by removal of enzyme activity using indirect immunoprecipitation; and third, by affinity column chromatography. Several monoclonal antibodies were identified. One of them, 4C3-21 was characterized in detail here. This monoclonal antibody recognized the native form of RNA polymerase II from chicken oviduct, calf thymus, and HeLa cells, but it did not recognize Escherichia coli RNA polymerase. In addition, after interacting with RNA polymerase, this antibody did not inhibit total RNA synthesis nor specific initiation of transcription on cloned ovalbumin fragments in vitro. Finally, since the antibody did not react with polymerase subunits separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we deduced that the antibody interacted with the native form of the enzyme at a site which is not involved in initiation or elongation of RNA synthesis. This allowed us to undertake an unique approach utilizing antibody affinity column chromatography for purification of transcriptional factors. Using this approach, we demonstrated that certain transcription factor(s) were associated with RNA polymerase II and could be absorbed to an affinity column as an RNA polymerase-transcriptional factor complex. Differential elution can be carried out subsequently. Therefore, this antibody column should prove to be very useful for the purification of transcriptional regulatory factor(s) which bind to RNA polymerase.";-;transcription factor;polyacrylamide;hard_3
8604027;Protein tyrosine kinases in activation signal of human basophils through the immunoglobulin E receptor type l.;Human basophils activated through high-affinity immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptors (Fc epsilon RI) are involved in the late phase of the allergic reaction. To investigate the possible involvement of protein-tyrosine kinases in this activation we used human acute basophilic leukemia (ABL) cells in culture as well as a pure population of normal basophils in vitro-derived from human bone marrow precursor cells (HBMB). ABL cells were 50-80% basophils at various stages of maturation as assessed by staining, morphology, ultrastructure, and flow cytometry analysis, and only basophils in ABL cells expressed Fc epsilon RI. Aggregation of Fc epsilon RI by IgE and anti-IgE, IgE and antigen, or anti-Fc epsilon RI monoclonal antibodies on ABL cells or on HBMB, led to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of 120-, 100-, 80-, 72-, 50- to 65-, and 38-kDa substrates. Tyrosine phosphorylations in ABL cells were in basophils because 1) they were detected after a 5-s stimulation, 2) they were observed under conditions where mediator release is minimal, i.e., in the absence of extracellular calcium, 3) hapten addition during antigen stimulation resulted in almost total disappearance of tyrosine phosphorylations within 30 s. There was correlation between histamine release and tyrosine phosphorylation in anti-IgE dose-responses and in dose-responses of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. The tyrosine kinase p72syk was detected in the cells. Stimulation of ABL cells for 1 min resulted in extracellular calcium-independent tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of p72syk. Therefore, tyrosine kinases are involved in the early steps of human Fc epsilon RI signaling in basophils. Tyrosine kinases and their substrates could represent new potential therapeutic targets to prevent the development of the allergic reaction.;-;antigen;-;hard_2

1096952;Partial degradation of transfer RNAs by different preparations of snake venom exonuclease.;The degradation of yeast tRNASer with eight different exonuclease preparations from four snake venoms was investigated. The reaction products were separated on polyacrylamide gels containing 7 M urea. Patterns of sharp bands were obtained which were more or less similar. Two tRNA fragments were characterized by oligonucleotide analyses, one of which was tRNA degraded by the exonuclease up to the beginning of the T-phi-C-stem. The other one was generated by the additional loss of several nucleotides from the 5'-terminus. The formation of the latter fragment was very probably caused by an endonuclease activity in the exonuclease. The endonuclease contaminant, which was found in all preparations, was further investigated by experiments with modified tRNAs whose 3'-terminus should be resistant to exonuclease (tRNASer-A, tRNASerOX-red). With 3'-AMP as substrate no phosphatase activity was found under the conditions of tRNA degradation. Not only in tRNASer, but also in yeast tRNATyr and tRNAAla as well as in fragments of tRNASer and tRNAPhe, the degradation by exonuclease was inhibited at the beginning of the T-phi-C-stem. The finding of such a retardation site in addition to the general retardation of exonuclease digestion after removal of the C-C-A sequence may indicate that retardation at certain elements of secondary structure is a more general feature of degradations by this enzyme.;-;phosphatase activity;polyacrylamide;hard_3
30153828;The c-Myc-regulated lncRNA NEAT1 and paraspeckles modulate imatinib-induced apoptosis in CML cells.;Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal disease characterized by the presence of the constitutively active tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL oncoprotein. Although BCR-ABL is crucially important for pathogenesis and treatment response, it is thought that some additional factors might be involved in the regulation of these processes. Aberrant expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) has recently been identified to be involved in various diseases including cancer, suggesting that lncRNAs may play a role in BCR-ABL-mediated CML. In this study, we found that nuclear-enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1), a lncRNA essential for the formation of nuclear body paraspeckles, is significantly repressed in primary CML cells. NEAT1 expression could be restored by inhibiting BCR-ABL expression or its kinase activity in K562 cells. We also demonstrated that NEAT1 is regulated by c-Myc. Knockdown of NEAT1 could promote imatinib (IM)-induced apoptosis, and we demonstrated that the NEAT1-binding paraspeckle protein splicing factor proline/glutamine-rich (SFPQ) is required for NEAT1-mediated apoptosis in K562 cells. RNA-seq analysis revealed that SFPQ regulates cell growth and death pathway-related genes, confirming its function in IM-induced apoptosis. Collectively, these results assign a biological function to the NEAT1 lncRNA in CML apoptosis and may lead to fuller understanding of the molecular events leading to CML. ;glutamine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function

Purified enzyme labeled in vivo with radioactive lysine, arginine, or methionine was digested with trypsin and the tryptic peptides were separated by column chromatography on Bio-Rad cation exchanger Aminex A-5. Less than 50 ng (2 pmol) of HPRT is required to produce a tryptic peptide pattern. A methionine-labeled peptide was identified as the COOH-terminus because it was not labeled with either lysine or arginine. We have compared the tryptic peptide patterns of normal HeLaHPRT and a crossreacting HPRT protein lacking enzyme activity from HeLa mutant H23 [Milman et al. (1976) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 73, 4589--4593]. The mutant protein has a new lysine-labeled peptide, but the chromatography patterns of arginine- or methionine-labeled peptides appear identical to those of the normal protein. The appearance in the H23 mutant HPRT protein of a new tryptic peptide provides strong evidence for a mutation in the HPRT structural gene. The tryptic peptide patterns were used to determine the total number of residues of labeled amino acid in the protein, and the values are reasonably consistent with those determined by conventional amino acid analysis pf erythrocyte HPRT.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
11493547;Two distinct domains of Bicoid mediate its transcriptional downregulation by the Torso pathway.;The transcriptional activity of the Bicoid morphogen is directly downregulated by the Torso signal transduction cascade at the anterior pole of the Drosophila embryo. This regulation does not involve the homeodomain or direct phosphorylation of Bicoid. We analyse the transcriptional regulation of Bicoid in response to the Torso pathway, using Bicoid variants and fusion proteins between the Bicoid domains and the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. We show that Bicoid possesses three autonomous activation domains. Two of these domains, the serine/threonine-rich and the acidic domains, are downregulated by Torso, whereas the third activation domain, which is rich in glutamine, is not. The alanine-rich domain, previously described as an activation domain in vitro, has a repressive activity that is independent of Torso. Thus, Bicoid downregulation by Torso results from a competition between the glutamine-rich domain that is insensitive to Torso and the serine/threonine-rich and acidic activation domains downregulated by Torso. The alanine-rich domain contributes to this process indirectly by reducing the global activity of the protein and in particular the activity of the glutamine-rich domain that might otherwise prevent downregulation by Torso. ;glutamine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

9542093;Nocardia crassostreae sp. nov., the causal agent of nocardiosis in Pacific oysters.;Seven strains of bacteria were isolated from Pacific oysters, Crassostrea gigas, with a focal or systemic disease. The strains were aerobic, Gram-positive, acid-fast, produced a mycelium which fragmented into irregular rod-like elements, had a peptidoglycan containing meso-diaminopimelic acid, arabinose and galactose as major sugars, mycolic acids with 46-58 carbon atoms and G + C-rich DNA. All of these properties are consistent with the classification of the organisms in the genus Nocardia. A partial sequence of the 16S rRNA gene of isolate NB4H was determined following isolation and cloning of the PCR-amplified gene. The sequence was aligned with those of representative mycolic-acid-containing taxa and a phylogenetic tree was generated using the neighbour-joining method. It was evident from the phylogenetic tree that the three strains tested, RB1, OB3P and NB4H, were identical and belonged to the Nocardia otitidiscaviarum rRNA sub-group. The biochemical, chemical, morphological and physiological properties of the isolates were also essentially identical and served to distinguish them from representative nocardiae. It is, therefore, proposed that the strains isolated from the diseased Pacific oysters be assigned to a new species, Nocardia crassostreae.

21526191;Relationship between gene body DNA methylation and intragenic H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 chromatin marks.;To elucidate the relationship between intragenic DNA methylation and chromatin marks, we performed epigenetic profiling of chromosome 19 in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) and in the colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 as well as its counterpart with double knockout of DNMT1 and DNMT3B (HCT116-DKO). Analysis of H3K36me3 profiles indicated that this intragenic mark of active genes is associated with two categories of genes: (i) genes with low CpG density and H3K9me3 in the gene body or (ii) genes with high CpG density and DNA methylation in the gene body. We observed that a combination of low CpG density in gene bodies together with H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 occupancy is a specific epigenetic feature of zinc finger (ZNF) genes, which comprise 90% of all genes carrying both histone marks on chromosome 19. For genes with high intragenic CpG density, transcription and H3K36me3 occupancy were not changed in conditions of partial or intensive loss of DNA methylation in gene bodies. siRNA knockdown of SETD2, the major histone methyltransferase responsible for production of H3K36me3, did not reduce DNA methylation in gene bodies. Our study suggests that the H3K36me3 and DNA methylation marks in gene bodies are established largely independently of each other and points to similar functional roles of intragenic DNA methylation and intragenic H3K9me3 for CpG-rich and CpG-poor genes, respectively. ;-;zinc finger;-;hard_2

Endogenous phosphatase activity is not present after purification, and added pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphate phosphatase does not re-activate BCOAD or liberate 32P from previously labelled enzyme.

10744072;Cytoprotection by metallothionein against gastroduodenal mucosal injury caused by ethanol in mice.;Metallothionein (MT) is a small, cysteine-rich protein that can act as a free radical scavenger at least in vitro. To test the hypothesis that MT participates in gastroduodenal cytoprotection, we studied sensitivity to gastroduodenal mucosal injury caused by ethanol in MT-null mice that have null mutations in MT-I and MT-II genes. MT-null mice and wild-type mice were orally treated with ethanol (60% or 99.5%, 0.2 ml/mouse). The macroscopic gastric lesion indices were significantly higher in MT-null mice than in wild-type mice 90 minutes after ethanol treatment. Histopathological examination in ethanol-treated MT-null mice showed vacuolar degeneration, necrosis of the epithelial cells, and hemorrhage throughout the tunica mucosa. Moreover, the duodenum also showed morphologic changes, including marked degeneration and coagulative necrosis of the entire villi, desquamation of the degenerated epithelial cells, and hemorrhage. In contrast, histopathologic changes were less prominent in the wild-type mice treated with ethanol. MT was not detected either in the stomach or duodenum of MT-null mice, whereas gastric and duodenal zinc contents were not significantly different between MT-null mice and wild-type mice. These results provide direct evidence that intrinsic MT plays a cytoprotective role in gastroduodenal mucosal injury caused by ethanol.;cysteine;-;-;LCR_without_function
30013954;Screening and Identification of B-Cell Epitopes in the P61 Protein of Nocardia brasiliensis.;The P61 protein is an immunodominant antigen of Nocardia brasiliensis that is observed in the sera from patients infected with the bacterium. However, the B-cell epitopes of N. brasiliensis are still unresolved. To identify the antigenic determinants of P61, we screened seven monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against P61 protein that was expressed in the Escherichia coli system. A series of truncated peptides of P61 were then generated and the mAbs were used to screen these peptides by Western blot analyses. Three B-cell epitopes were recognized by the P61 specific mAbs: 461-FEYWTKVDPEIGKRIEEG-478, 427-LVREVFNDAQRDRLVSNVVGGVQEPV. LSRVFEYWTKVDPEIGKRIEEGVRAG-482, and 447-HVLGGVQEPVLSRVFEY WTKVDPEI GKRIEEGVRAGLD-484. The latter two epitopes were further identified by N. brasiliensis-infected mouse serum. These results facilitate future investigations of serodiagnostic methods to identify Nocardia infections.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
518911;Purification and characterization of 33 kilodalton protein of spinach chloroplasts.;A protein was prepared from spinach chloroplasts in a highly purified form. The isoelectric point of the protein was 5.2. The apparent molecular weight was estimated to be 33 000 by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and urea, and 34 000 by gel filtration column chromatography with Sephadex G-100. The protein was provisionally named '33 kilodalton protein' according to the molecular weight. The absorption spectrum of the protein did not show any absorption band in the visible region. No histidine was found in the amino acid analysis of the protein. The 33 kilodalton protein was released from the thylakoid membrane by EDTA-treatment and also by sonic oscillation. The protein was bound to System II particles, but not to System I particles.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
3968853;The deoxyuridine suppression test identifies subtle cobalamin deficiency in patients without typical megaloblastic anemia.;Four patients had serum cobalamin levels that were initially thought to be falsely low. None of the patients had the typical hematologic and clinical features of cobalamin deficiency and the three so tested had normal cobalamin absorption and/or gastric function. However, the deoxyuridine suppression test result was abnormal in all four cases. The abnormality was improved by adding cobalamin in vitro but, in three of the four cases, was not corrected and, indeed, was made worse by the addition of methyl tetrahydrofolate. These results established metabolically the presence of cobalamin deficiency. The recently improved cobalamin radioassays may be unmasking some atypical and, heretofore, unappreciated cobalamin-deficiency states (only one of our four patients would have come to attention with the older radioassays). These can be identified with the deoxyuridine suppression test, particularly when specific in vitro additives are included.;-;-;-;hard_0
7496478;[Lymphomatoid papulosis in a child].;"BACKGROUND
Lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP), uncommon in children, has a benign clinical course in contrast with a malignant histology.


CASE REPORT
A 9-year old boy developed nodular skin lesions for 6 months on the scalp and penis and a papule skin on his trunk. Surgical excision of scalp nodules was performed to prevent necrosis and ulceration of the ear. The biopsy showed a dense mixed cellular infiltrate including histiocytes, lymphocytes and numerous atypical large cells of which a minority expressed the CD30 antigen. PCR showed an oligoclonal rearrangement of the TCR gamma chain gene. Physical examination, bone marrow aspirate and thoracoabdominal CT scans were normal. Three years after surgery, no other lesions occurred.


DISCUSSION
Differential diagnosis of LyP is difficult with non Hodgkin's lymphoma, especially CD30+ lymphoma. Prognosis remains the major problem in LyP. Ten to 20% of cases are associated with lymphomas in adults.";-;antigen;-;hard_2
15732781;[Expression of beta-catenin protein in laryngeal squamous-cell carcinoma].;beta-catenin and APC are key components of Wnt signaling pathway. Moreover beta-catenin protein is an adhesion molecule, which exists in complex with E-cadherin. Although clinical impact of beta-catenin in laryngeal cancer is still unclear. Our purpose was to investigate an expression of beta-catenin and its possible prognostic value in laryngeal cancer. The group of 41 patients with laryngeal cancer, surgically treated with minimum 5 years observation, was multi-variously analysed. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections from each case were immunohistochemically stained with a monoclonal antibody raised against beta-catenin antigen. By univariate analysis expression of beta-catenin analysed on the front of laryngeal tumour proved to be significantly related to overall and disease free survival, which were shorter in cases with cytoplasmatic expression. Although there were co correlation with overall and disease free survival in assessment of beta-catenin examined in the middle of tumours. Expression of beta-catenin in the primary tumours was not associated with its size, nodal status, local and nodal recurrences and histological stage (grading). Analysis of beta-catenin protein expression enables the assessment of biology of laryngeal cancer and it can be a prognostic factor of overall and disease free survival, while measures on front tumour in patients with laryngeal cancer.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
23719486;Source and mixing state of iron-containing particles in Shanghai by individual particle analysis.;Bioavailable iron (Fe) is an essential nutrient that can control oceanic productivity, thereby impacting the global carbon budget and climate. Therefore it is of vital importance to identify chemical species and mixing state of Fe-containing particles in the air, which are demonstrated to pose substantial impact on bioavailability of Fe. Using a single particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SPAMS), ~2,000,000 individual particles with mass spectra were collected in Shanghai for nearly 22d during the winter of 2011. Number fraction of Fe-containing particles (NfFe) varied in a wide range (<1-15%) throughout the measurement. Fe-containing particles were mainly clustered into four chemical groups, comprising of Fe-rich, K-rich, Dust and V-containing particle types. Analysis of mass spectra and mixing state suggests that Fe-containing particles correspond to various sources in Shanghai, especially anthropogenic sources iron/steel industrial activities, and fly ashes from both biomass burning and coal combustion, accounting for ~55% and ~18%, respectively. However, invasion of dust from northern desert areas is suspected to be more responsible for the spikes of NfFe (>10%), when Dust particle type contributed to >50% of Fe-containing particles. It is also revealed that Fe-containing particles were internally mixed with secondary species (e.g., sulfate and nitrate). Anthropogenic K-rich and Fe-rich particles tended to associate with both sulfate and nitrate, and thus might lead to more fraction of soluble Fe, compared to Dust particles. These results imply that atmospheric processing of Fe-containing particles from various sources might vary and thus would change the bioavailability of atmospheric Fe.;lysine;-;-;LCR_without_function
466787;Improved method for detecting hemagglutination by centrifugal analysis.;"Centrifugal analysis can be used to detect hepatitis B surface antigen, antibody to rubella virus, and fibrin-related antigen. The procedure is performed with the same reagents used in conventional hemagglutination studies. Positive and negative reactions are distinguished by the rates of erythrocyte clearance in the centrifugal field (delta A/delta time); positive cells move more rapidly than negative cells, and this difference varies directly with the concentration of detectable antigen or antibody. This phenomenon is thought to be a result of the greater adhesion of negative cells to the cuvette's surface. Sensitivity and specificity are greater in the centrifugal analysis technique than in the more conventional hemagglutination tests. False-positive reactions are eliminated and the quantitative data are accurate and reproducible.";-;antigen;-;hard_2
8441424;A human mitochondrial transcriptional activator can functionally replace a yeast mitochondrial HMG-box protein both in vivo and in vitro.;Human mitochondrial transcription factor A is a 25-kDa protein that binds immediately upstream of the two major mitochondrial promoters, thereby leading to correct and efficient initiation of transcription. Although the nature of yeast mitochondrial promoters is significantly different from that of human promoters, a potential functional homolog of the human transcriptional activator protein has been previously identified in yeast mitochondria. The importance of the yeast protein in yeast mitochondrial DNA function has been shown by inactivation of its nuclear gene (ABF2) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells resulting in loss of mitochondrial DNA. We report here that the nuclear gene for human mitochondrial transcription factor A can be stably expressed in yeast cells devoid of the yeast homolog protein. The human protein is imported efficiently into yeast mitochondria, is processed correctly, and rescues the loss-of-mitochondrial DNA phenotype in a yeast abf2 strain, thus functionally substituting for the yeast protein. Both human and yeast proteins affect yeast mitochondrial transcription initiation in vitro, suggesting that the two proteins may have a common role in this fundamental process.;-;transcription factor;-;hard_2
1334106;Genomic organization and chromosomal localization of the human CD27 gene.;CD27 is a lymphocyte-specific member of a recently identified receptor family with at least 10 members that includes the receptors for nerve growth factor and TNF, CD40, and Fas. Several members of this family play a role in cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival. Within the amino terminal ligand binding domain of these receptors, repeat motifs have been identified. These repeats contain many cysteine residues in a conserved pattern, characteristic of this family. We have isolated and characterized the human CD27 gene to gain insight into the evolution of this type of receptor domain. The gene was localized on chromosome 12, band 12p13. Sequence analysis showed no correlation between the intron/exon organization and the subdivision of the protein into distinct domains. Structural information for the cysteine-rich domain is contained within three exons. In addition, the splice sites in the CD27 gene are located in a different position from those in the related nerve growth factor receptor gene. However, a comparison of the splice sites within the regions encoding the respective ligand-binding domains of the CD27 and nerve growth factor receptor genes identifies the archetypal cysteine-rich building blocks, from which the members of this family may have arisen during the course of evolution. From this observation, we propose a new organization of the repeat motifs.;cysteine;-;-;LCR_without_function
7407581;Characteristic protein fractions of cerebrospinal fluid disc electrophoretic analysis.;"The present work was undertaken to determine characteristic proteins of normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by disc electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel, and to evaluate their usefulness as indicators of blood-brain-CSF barrier disturbance. The technique has been applied to 1280 samples of unconcentrated CSF obtained from 27 reference subjects and 847 neurological patients, with a simultaneous analysis of 361 sera. The pre-albumin content (mean +/- S.D. as a percentage of total protein, 11.0 +/- 2.3%) was higher than formerly reported. One reason for this is that preliminary concentration was not necessary, and the second is related to the principle of protein resolution. The no. 5 protein band of the post-albumin group (3.9 +/- 1.1%) was characteristic, though it has not yet been identified. The no. 3 protein band of the post-transferrin group (5.2 +/- 1.7%) was highly specific to CSF; it was found to be closely related to transferrin, and may correspond to tau fraction obtained by other methods. Barrier dysfunction was easily recognizable by the appearance of polymers of haptoglobin 2-1 or 2-2, because only haptoglobin 1-1 was detected in normal CSF. The percentage of the main region of the G-zone (13.7 +/- 2.6%) was postulated as normal content of CSF immunoglobulins.";-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
1320932;Bifunctional intercalator [N-MeCys3,N-MeCys7]TANDEM binds to the dinucleotide TpA.;The binding of [N-MeCys3,N-MeCys7]TANDEM has been examined by DNase I footprinting and diethyl pyrocarbonate modification of several synthetic DNA fragments containing AT-rich regions. DNase I footprinting reveals that at low concentrations the ligand binds preferentially to the center of (AT)n regions. A fragment containing the tetranucleotide AATT was unaffected by the ligand. Diethyl pyrocarbonate modification of several fragments containing blocks of (AT)n revealed a pattern in which alternate adenines were rendered more reactive in the presence of the ligand. These reactive adenines were staggered across the two DNA strands in the 3'-direction, consistent with ligand binding to the dinucleotide TpA. In sequences of the type (TAA)n.(TTA)n, binding of [N-MeCys3,N-MeCys7]TANDEM resulted in strong modification of the second adenine in the sequence TAA, i.e., the base on the 3'-side of the ligand binding site. Data for binding to (AT)n are best explained by suggesting that the adenines sandwiched between the quinoxaline chromophores are rendered most reactive to diethyl pyrocarbonate.;threonine;-;-;LCR_without_function
623125;The effect of 1alpha(OH)D3 and 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 on the bone in patients with renal osteodystrophy.;Six patients with chronic renal disease and variable degrees of renal osteodystrophy were treated for three weeks with either 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1alpha25(OH)D3) or 1alpha,hydroxyvitamin D3 (1alpha(OH)D3) and both the biochemical and osseous responses measured. The most consistent changes seen were an increase in serum calcium concentration to normal, a decrease in immunoreactive parathyroid hormone toward normal, an increase in the extent of the calcification front and a decrease in the extent of fibrous dysplasia in the marrow cavity. Two important parameters which did not change significantly were serum alkaline phosphatase activity and the osteoid volume. These data, in conjunction with that from previous studies, indicate that therapy with 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 or 1alpha(OH)D3 does not heal the osteomalacia of renal osteodystrophy, but that it does suppress the secondary hyperparathyroidism, and ameliorate the osteitis fibrosa seen in patients with chronic renal disease. They raise the likelihood that additional factors, such as metabolites of vitamin D other than 1alpha,25(OH)2D3, play a role in regulating bone formation and/or mineralization.;-;phosphatase activity;-;hard_2
8891447;Adaptation of a simple flow cytometric assay to identify different stages during apoptosis.;Apoptosis occurs under many different physiological and pathological conditions, and it reflects a genetically encoded suicide program that can be triggered by different stimuli in susceptible cells. We adapted a flow cytometric assay for the detection of apoptosis based on differential staining of viable cells with two different DNA binding dyes, propidium iodide (PI) and Hoechst 33342 (Ho342). Apoptosis was induced in different cell lines by gamma irradiation, an anti-FAS monoclonal antibody, or ganciclovir in Herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase-expressing cells. We could identify three different populations that appeared sequentially after the induction of apoptosis. Cells corresponding to these populations were sorted and assessed for evidence of apoptosis as determined by alterations of nuclear morphology and detection of endonucleolytic activity. This analysis revealed a PI- population with subtle apoptotic changes and increased Ho342 fluorescence compared with untreated cells. Extensive apoptotic alterations were observed in a PI+ population that increased over time following the induction of apoptosis. A third population was characterized by an intermediate intensity of PI fluorescence and decreased Ho342 fluorescence compared with the other populations. This population appeared late after treatment and consisted of apoptotic bodies. Taken together, these data suggest that distinct stages of apoptosis can be identified by differential staining of cells with Ho342 and PI. This assay should be useful for the detection and further characterization of cells at different stages in the apoptotic process.;-;nucleic acid binding;-;hard_2
1629951;Mutational analysis of the core, spacer, and initiator regions of vaccinia virus intermediate-class promoters.;Activation of vaccinia virus late gene transcription is dependent on DNA replication and the expression of three genes: A1L, A2L, and G8R (J. G. Keck, C. J. Baldick, Jr., and B. Moss, Cell 61:801-809, 1990). To fully characterize the promoter elements of these trans-activator genes, we prepared more than 140 plasmid vectors containing natural and mutated DNA segments ligated to the Escherichia coli lacZ or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene. Expression of the reporter genes occurred when the plasmids were transfected into vaccinia virus-infected cells and was enhanced when DNA replication was prevented, indicating that the A1L, A2L, and G8R promoters belong to the intermediate regulatory class. Deletional mutagenesis demonstrated that the regulatory elements of all three promoters extended between 20 and 30 nucleotides upstream of their RNA start sites. Single-base substitutions of the G8R promoter revealed two critical elements located from -26 to -13 (the core element) and -1 to +3 (the initiator element). Mutations in these regions drastically affected expression, as determined by beta-galactosidase and mRNA analyses. Additional mutations defined the TAAA sequence as the critical initiator element. The length, but not the nucleotide sequence, of the segment between the core and initiator regions was crucial. The requirement for the spacer to be 10 or 11 nucleotides was consistent with a single turn of a double helix. The A1L and A2L promoters resembled the G8R promoter, and mutations in the conserved bases had the predicted effects on expression. We concluded that the three intermediate promoters are composed of a 14-bp A+T-rich core sequence separated by one turn of the double helix from the TAAA initiator element.;threonine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
12200228;Cloning and characterization of an androgen receptor N-terminal-interacting protein with ubiquitin-protein ligase activity.;"The androgen receptor (AR) N-terminal domain plays a critical role in androgen-responsive gene regulation. A novel AR N-terminal-interacting protein (ARNIP) was isolated using the yeast two-hybrid system and its interaction with amino acids 11-172 of the normal or corresponding region of the polyglutamine-expanded human AR confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays. ARNIP cDNAs cloned from NSC-34 (mouse neuroblastoma/spinal cord) or PC-3 (human prostate adenocarcinoma) mRNA encoded highly homologous 30 kDa (261 amino acids) cysteine-rich proteins with a RING-H2 (C3H2C3 zinc finger) domain; this motif is highly conserved in predicted ARNIP-homologous proteins from several other species. Expression of the approximately 1.7 kb ARNIP mRNA was detected in various tissues by Northern blotting, but was highest in mouse testes, kidney and several neuronal cell lines. In addition, the human ARNIP protein was found to be encoded by nine exons spanning 32 kb on chromosome 4q21. In COS-1 cells, coexpression of ARNIP and AR did not affect AR ligand-binding kinetics, nor did ARNIP act as a coactivator or corepressor in transactivation assays. However, AR N-terminal:C-terminal interaction was reduced in the presence of ARNIP. Intriguingly, ARNIP, and in particular its RING-H2 domain, functioned as a ubiquitin-protein ligase in vitro in the presence of a specific ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, Ubc4-1. Mutation of a single cysteine residue in the ARNIP RING-H2 domain (Cys145Ala) abolished this E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Fluorescent protein tagging studies revealed that AR-ARNIP interaction was hormone-independent in COS-1 cells, and suggest that colocalization of both AR and ARNIP to the nucleus upon androgen addition may allow ARNIP to play a role in nuclear processes. Thus, identification of a novel AR-interacting protein with ubiquitin ligase activity will stimulate further investigation into the role of ubiquitination and the ubiquitin-proteasome system in AR-mediated cellular functions.

41456;A method for the isolation and identification of dengue viruses, using mosquito cell cultures.;An improved method for the isolation and identification of dengue viruses is described. Viruses were isolated in mosquito cell cultures (C6/36 or AP-61), identified by indirect fluorescent antibody technique, and typed by complement-fixation test, using the cell culture fluid as antigen. The sensitivity of this method was compared with mosquito inoculation in comparative titrations of 16 low passage dengue virus strains. Although lower virus titers were obtained by the mosquito cell culture technique, its decreased sensitivity was compensated for by the much larger volume (588X) which could be assayed. By incubating the mosquito cells at 32 degrees C, dengue viruses can be identified and typed within 6 days after inoculation.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
15279563;Regulation of MAO-A and MAO-B gene expression.;MAO A and B genes are made of 15 exons with identical exon-intron organization. They are located on X-chromosome organized in opposite direction, tail to tail with 24 kb apart. Both promoters are GC-rich and regulated by transcription factor Sp1. However, they have distinctly different features. MAO B gene, but not MAO A gene, has TATA box. MAO B promoter contains two clusters of overlapping Sp1 sites, the CACCC repressor element. Transcription factors Sp1 and Sp4 can activate MAO B promoter activity through the proximal cluster of Sp1 sites and its activation can be repressed by the over-expression of Sp3 and a related family member, BTEB2. Decreased methylation and transcription repressor Sp3 upregulate human MAO B, but not MAO A, gene expression during Caco-2 differentiation. MAO B, but not MAO A gene, could be activated by PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) by protein kinase C, MAPkinase signal transduction pathway involves cJun and Egr-1. The differences in MAO A and B gene regulation may explain the different tissue-specific expression and functions of these two important isoenzymes. ;cysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

The procedure developed was used to isolate the enzyme from up to 23 liters of packed erythrocytes at one time. An easily prepared affinity column bed material employing adenosine as the ligand was used as the final step in the purification. During elution from the affinity column there was approximately a 3:1 partition of adenosine deaminase between gel bed and column buffer. There was no apparent difference in the partitioning of unresolved or partially resolved preparations of the electrophoretically different forms of the enzyme on the affinity column. Gel filtration and electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels of increasing concentration revealed no differences in the Mr of these electrophoretically different forms. The four bands resolved by electrophoresis of the different forms on polyacrylamide gels under nondenaturing conditions yielded a single band when electrophoresis was carried out in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and 2-mercaptoethanol. Partially resolved preparations of the different electrophoretic forms of adenosine deaminase also gave rise to a single band of the same mobility when electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels  under these conditions.

Sixty-four patients (ages 44-77 years) underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy after staging with both MRI and TRUS. Surgical specimens were step-sectioned and examined at multiple levels. Radiographic staging was correlated with pathological staging. Both MRI and TRUS demonstrated better staging accuracy than conventional digital rectal examination [42% for digital rectal examination (DRE), 63% by TRUS, and 67% by MRI], although they suffered from understaging (31% by TRUS and 22% by MRI). The positive predictive value (PPV) for stage B disease was disappointingly low (42% for DRE, 53% for TRUS and 59% for MRI). However, the PPV for stage C disease was higher (81% for TRUS and 77% for MRI). In the evaluation of extracapsular invasion, the PPV of TRUS (81%) was higher than that of MRI (77%). The negative predictive value (NPV), however, for both TRUS and MRI was low (58 and 56%, respectively). In the evaluation of seminal vesicle invasion, both TRUS and MRI demonstrated poor PPV (50 and 40%, respectively), but the NPV was excellent (90% for TRUS and 96% for MRI).

2543662;A novel brain-specific antigen: a glycoprotein electrophoretically similar to but immunochemically different from type B nucleoside diphosphatase.;A monoclonal antibody, 1D4, recognizing a novel brain-specific protein was obtained. The 1D4 antigen is regarded to be a glycoprotein because it was adsorbed on the Con A-Sepharose column used for its purification. The antiserum (polyclonal antibodies) against the 1D4 antigen was raised in a rabbit and shown to react with just the same molecules as the 1D4 monoclonal antibody did. It was used to detect the antigen in crude tissue homogenates. The molecular mass of the 1D4 antigen was estimated to be 89 kDa by immunoblotting after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the brain homogenate. The 1D4 antigen had multiple isoelectric points, the pattern of the bands detected on isoelectric focusing gel being quite similar to that of Type B nucleoside diphosphatase of the brain. However, they are distinct, since Type B nucleoside diphosphatase was not adsorbed by anti-1D4 antigen IgG-Sepharose 4B. The 1D4 antigen could not be detected in any of the peripheral organs or tissues tested. The 1D4 antigen was rich in the cerebrum, diencephalon, and cerebellum in the brain, and its content decreased with the distance of the region from the cerebrum. The amounts of the 1D4 antigen in the cerebrum and cerebellum increased with the respective developmental maturation. These findings suggest that the 1D4 antigen contributes to some brain-specific functions of the mature brain.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
6974731;Occurrence of H1o-like protein and protein A24 in the chromatin of bullfrog erythrocytes lacking histone 5.;Electrophoretic analysis of acid-soluble chromosomal protein isolated from the erythrocytes of the bullfrog Rana catesbeiana reveals that the nucleated erythrocytes contain five major histones (H1A, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) and three minor histone-like proteins (H1B, R1, and R2). Histone 5, found as an additional major histone of avian erythrocytes, is not detected in the frog erythrocytes. Three minor components of the bullfrog erythrocytes, which are not present in the avian erythrocytes, have been purified to electrophoretic homogeneity and characterized by amino acid analysis, NH2-terminal analysis, tryptic peptide mapping, and immunological techniques. H1B extracted with 5% HClO4 along with H1A has a very similar amino acid composition and tryptic peptide map to H1o, a subfraction of lysine-rich histones found in nondividing mammalian cells. Microcomplement fixation also shows that H1B and bovine liver H1o share some common antigenic determinants. R1, a basic protein having a ratio of basic/acidic amino acids of 2.0 and 20 mol % lysine, is distinguished from any chromosomal proteins characterized so far on the basis of electrophoretic mobility and amino acid composition. On the other hand, R2 is identified as protein A24 on the basis of its electrophoretic mobility, amino acid composition, and tryptic peptide map. Since H1o and protein A24 are considered to be involved in the inhibition of DNA replication and RNA synthesis, respectively, H1o-like protein and protein A24 in the frog erythrocyte lacking H5 may have central roles in genetic inactivation during erythrocyte maturation.;lysine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
1850305;Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of human platelet surface proteins by an ecto-protein kinase/phosphatase system.;We have characterized a novel ecto-protein kinase activity and a novel ecto-protein phosphatase activity on the membrane surface of human platelets. Washed intact platelets, when incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP in Tyrode's buffer, showed the phosphorylation of a membrane surface protein migrating with an apparent molecular mass of 42 kDa on 5-15% SDS polyacrylamide gradient gels. The 42 kDa protein could be further resolved on 15% SDS gels into two proteins of 39 kDa and 42 kDa. In this gel system, it was found that the 39 kDa protein became rapidly phosphorylated and dephosphorylated, whereas the 42 kDa protein was phosphorylated and dephosphorylated at a much slower rate. NaF inhibited the dephosphorylation of these proteins indicating the involvement of an ecto-protein phosphatase. The platelet membrane ecto-protein kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of both of these proteins was identified as a serine kinase and showed dependency on divalent cations Mg2+ or Mn2+ ions. Ca2+ ions potentiated the Mg(2+)-dependent ecto-protein kinase activity. The ecto-protein kinase rapidly phosphorylated histone and casein added exogenously to the extracellular medium of intact platelets. Following activation of platelets by alpha-thrombin, the incorporation of [32P]phosphate from exogenously added [gamma-32P]ATP by endogenous protein substrates was reduced by 90%, suggesting a role of the ecto-protein kinase system in the regulation of platelet function. The results presented here demonstrate that both protein kinase and protein phosphatase activities reside on the membrane surface of human platelets. These activities are capable of rapidly phosphorylating and dephosphorylating specific surface platelet membrane proteins which may play important roles in early events of platelet activation and secretion.;-;phosphatase activity;polyacrylamide;hard_3

1347744;A transferable silencing domain is present in the thyroid hormone receptor, in the v-erbA oncogene product and in the retinoic acid receptor.;Inhibition of gene transcription is brought about by several mechanisms. The least understood mechanism is probably silencing, the analogue to transcriptional enhancing. We provide evidence that the silencing function of the oncogene product v-ERBA or the cellular counterpart, the thyroid hormone receptor (TR, c-erbA) is located in the C-terminal part and is transferable to a heterologous DNA binding domain. Deletion analyses suggest an important role for a basic and hydrophilic amino acid stretch on both ends of the domain. In addition we show that the related retinoic acid receptor (RAR) also contains a functional silencing domain similar in size and amino acid sequence. However, the activity of this domain can be neutralized by an additional domain in the C-terminus which functions cell specifically.;-;nucleic acid binding;-;hard_2
9765818;The recA gene from Streptomyces rimosus R6: sequence and expression in Escherichia coli.;"The recA gene from Streptomyces rimusus encodes a 376-amino acids polypeptide (M(r) 39,702) that is one of the largest bacterial RecA proteins observed. Detailed analyses of the Streptomyces RecA proteins showed that all possess an additional and unique C-terminal, rich in lysines and alanines, which can form an additional terminal alpha helix. Expression of the S. rimosus RecA protein in Escherichia coli FR333 (delta recA306) was demonstrated using antibodies raised against E. coli RecA protein; expression was possible only from the S. rimosus promoter.

16708126;Prevalence of prothrombin gene mutation (G-A 20210 A) in general population: a pilot study.;The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of prothrombin gene mutation in a sample population from Pakistan. Two hundred apparently healthy unrelated adults (older than 18 years) were included in the study. The sample population comprised 100 Punjabis (male 50, female 50) and 100 Pathans (male 50, female 50). Patients with a history of previous thromboembolism were excluded from the study. Five milliliters (5 mL) of whole blood was drawn in an EDTA bottle. The DNA was extracted by the standard phenol-chloroform method. The DNA was amplified between exon number 14 and the 3'-untranslated region of the prothrombin gene by a polymerase chain reaction in a thermal cycler. Amplified products were digested overnight with HindIII at 37 degrees C. The digested products were electrophoresed on 6% polyacrylamide gel. The fragments were visualized by silver nitrate staining. A heterozygous wild type and an uncut amplified product were included in the electrophoresis strip for quality control. The wild type of DNA ran as a 350-bp fragment and internal control was cut as 550- and 150-bp fragments. The abnormal prothrombin gene was cut into 350-, 322-, and 28-bp fragments. Only two cases of heterozygous prothrombin gene mutation G-A 20210A were found in the sample studied, giving an overall carrier rate of 01% (95% CI 0.4-2.4%) in the target population.

21390853;Purification and immunological characterization of recombinant antigens expressed in the form of insoluble aggregates (inclusion bodies).;In the field of clinical diagnosis the determination of specific antibodies against distinct structural or functional antigenic proteins of a given pathogen is the most commonly used diagnostic tool for the detection of infections. Although most of the established test systems still use natural antigen from different sources, the advent of nucleic acid engineering opens up the possibility of producing proteins of limited natural availability as well as designing novel proteins using in vitro mutagenesis techniques. Recombinant technology has already proven to be an excellent alternative for the production of specific antigens, that are able to improve sensitivity as well as specifity. In general, the production of recombinant antigens for diagnostic purposes is inexpensive compared to the use of purified natural antigens. The major problems associated with the setup of recombinant test systems are, of course, the identification of those antigens or antigenic determinants that guarantee a safe serological diagnosis (see Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 ) and the expression of these fragments with high efficiency.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
6549550;Involvement of cell-cell adhesion molecules in liver colonization by metastatic murine lymphoma/lymphosarcoma variants.;Metastatic variant sublines of the murine RAW117 large cell lymphoma or lymphosarcoma have been established in vitro by sequential cycles of harvesting of liver tumor nodules after intravenous inoculation of tumor cell suspensions into syngeneic BALB/c mice. After five and ten in vivo selections for liver colonization, variant sublines RAW117-H5 and -H10, respectively, were established, and these formed significantly more surface liver tumors than the parental RAW117-P line. RAW117 sublines were tested for their abilities to adhere to embryonic mouse liver or brain cells in an in vitro cell-cell adhesion assay. Liver colonizing RAW117-H10 cells adhered with greater selectivity to liver cells than to brain cells. Parental RAW117-P cells were more homotypically adhesive, but they were nonselective in their organ cell adhesion properties. We examined RAW117 cells for the presence of liver cross-reactive antigens using polyclonal xenoantibody preparations directed against embryonic murine liver cells. These antibody preparations block organ-specific homotypic adhesion of embryonic murine liver cells in vitro. The amount of fetal liver antigen(s) expressed on RAW117 sublines correlated with liver colonization potentials (H10 greater than H5 greater than P) in quantitative absorption assays. Treatment of the highly metastatic RAW117-H10 subline with polyclonal anti-embryonic murine liver F(ab')2 or Fab' antibody fragments had no effect on RAW117-H10 cell viability or growth in vitro or in vivo, but inhibited liver colonization (median liver tumor colonies reduced from greater than 200 to 0) and prolonged life expectancy. In contrast, pretreatment of RAW117-H10 cells with polyclonal anti-H-2 did not modify the in vivo biologic properties of these metastatic cells.;-;antigen;-;hard_2

LW, CW and casein diet groups were pair-fed with AW group. Changes in total lipids, lipid components, individual fatty acids, mitochondrial content in liver, heart, skeletal muscles, lungs and adipose tissue were determined after 8 weeks of feeding. AW diet resulted in accumulation of lipids (mainly acylglycerols) in heart, liver, skeletal muscles and depletion in adipose tissue. The LW and CW diets reversed the effects of AW diet, the CW being more effective than LW diet. The LW and CW diets increased the relative proportion of C 14:0, C 16:0, C 16:1 and decreased that of C18:1, C18:2; C18:3 fatty acids which were decreased and increased respectively, on the AW and casein diets. The fatty acids composition of adipose tissue was the same in all the groups. The AW diet increased the relative proportions of C 14:0, C 20:4 and decreased that of C 16:0, C 16:1, C 18:3 fatty acids in the lungs. Supplemented AW diet decreased the relative proportions of the former group and increased that of the later group including C 18:1 fatty acid also.

An electrophoretic analysis of whey protein from cynomolgus monkey milk revealed that its constituents are more similar to bovine milk than human milk, i.e. cynomolgus monkey milk whey contains, besides alpha-lactalbumin-like protein (LaP), another predominant component similar to bovine beta-lactoglobulin (LgP), in its electrophoretic behavior on both disc- and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoreses. 2. The amino acid composition of LaP shows close similarity to that of human alpha-lactalbumin, and LaP forms an immunoprecipitin line with anti-human alpha-lactalbumin rabbit antiserum. The homology between LaP and alpha-lactalbumin was further confirmed by an analysis of the N-terminal amino acid sequence. 3. LgP is not immunologically identical to bovine beta-lactoglobulin, but its amino acid composition is similar. The result of the N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of LgP (up to the 26th residue) strongly suggests homology between this protein and beta-lactoglobulin.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
3017316;Purification of cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase from rat heart by affinity chromatography on immobilized rolipram.;Affinity chromatography on a cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor related to Rolipram, immobilized to AH Sepharose allowed to perform an efficient purification of the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase isoenzyme from rat heart cytosol (102-fold purification with a 35% yield in a single step). This affinity chromatography involved a biospecific interaction since a 2 mM cAMP elution step at 30 degrees C was necessary for releasing the cAMP specific form tightly bound on the affinity gel. The cAMP eluate fraction exhibited a high specificity towards cAMP (cAMP/cGMP hydrolysis ratio 5-10), a marked sensitivity to Rolipram inhibition and could be resolved in two cAMP-specific, highly Rolipram-sensitive peaks of pI 6.7 and 4.8 by IEF on polyacrylamide gel plates.

7192695;The development of mucosal immunity in guinea pig middle ears.;Recent studies have suggested to us that the middle ear is an organ capable of responding immunologically to antigenic substance. However, it is still not known when and how the middle ear starts to provide the immunologic defense system. To clarify this, we investigated immunoglobulin forming cells of different classes and secretory proteins, such as secretory component and lactoferrin, in the mucous membrane of eustachian tube and tympanic bulla of 20 developing and 5 normal adult guinea pigs by the use of a direct immunofluorescence technique. Other organs, such as nose, larynx, trachea, small intestine, spleen and lymph node were also subjected to this investigation. Changes in the middle ear mucosa were also observed after antigenic challenges directly to the tympanic cavity of 6 developing and 39 adult guinea pigs. IgA and IgM forming cells began to appear in the tubal mucosa on 7th postnatal day, wile it was scarcely possible to find IgG1 and IgG2 forming cells in developing guinea pigs. Immunoglobulin forming cells of all classes increased in the middle ear mucosa after the antigenic stimuli. Results of this study showed that local synthesis of IgA, as well as other classes, is latent in the middle ear, that the middle ear of immature animals is vulnerable to antigenic stimuli, and that the middle ear of developing animals possesses potential immune responsiveness.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
19710137;Involvement of SSRP1 in latent replication of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus.;Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (also named human herpesvirus 8) is a gamma-herpesvirus that undergoes both lytic and latent infection. During latent infection, two viral elements are required: latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA), which functions as an origin binding protein, and the latent origin, which resides within the terminal repeats (TRs) of the viral genome. Previously, we identified two cis-elements within the TRs which are required for latent DNA replication: two LANA binding sites (LBS1 and LBS2 [LBS1/2]) and a GC-rich replication element (RE) upstream of LBS1/2. To further characterize the RE, we constructed a 71-bp minimal replicon (MR) and performed a detailed mutational analysis. Our data indicate that the first 8 nucleotides within the RE are critical for replication. Moreover, both the position and the distance between the RE and LBS1/2 can affect origin replication activity, suggesting that the RE may function as a loading pad for cellular proteins involved in replication. Using biotinylated DNA fragments of wild-type or mutant MRs as probes, we identified 30 proteins that preferentially bind to the origin. Among these proteins, structure-specific recognition protein 1 (SSRP1), a subunit of the FACT complex, and telomeric repeat binding factor 2 (TRF2) formed complexes with LANA at the MR region. Furthermore, the small interfering RNA-based knockdown of SSRP1, but not the dominant-negative-based knockdown of TRF2, significantly decreased the efficiency of LANA-dependent DNA replication. These results indicate that SSRP1 is a novel cellular protein involved in LANA-dependent DNA replication. ;cysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
15583358;Comparison of a visual to a computer-assisted technique for detecting apoptosis.;In many studies, fluorescent dyes (ethidium bromide [EB] and acridine orange [AO]) are used to stain DNA to determine if nuclei are apoptotic. However, there are numerous visual methods for counting these stained DNA that may lead to inaccuracies Measuring apoptosis by the visual counting method may be imprecise because of the variability of individuals' perception of color. Therefore, the authors compared a visual method of counting chromatin for apoptosis with a method relying on a computer program. They began counting chromatin using the visual method, in which individuals identify the stained DNA using their own visual perception. For comparison, they used a software-based counting method (analySIS software) to determine the color (hue) of the stained DNA. Using the numeric hue values from the software eliminates the variations in human color perception. Intra and interrater reliability of the visual and computer-assisted counting methods were evaluated with Spearman's. The authors found statistical significance in the intrarater reliability (r = 1.0, P = 0.0001 for all chromatin categories) and interrater reliability (r = 0.975, P = 0.005 for both readings) when using the software program. No statistical significance was found for the visual counting method, indicating inaccuracy between and within raters. Thus, the computer-assisted counting method of identifying the damaged DNA is more accurate and precise than the individual's visual perception of color. Based on these data, apoptosis measurements using color staining with EB and AO should be determined using hue values generated by a computer program and not by a researcher's visual assessment.;-;-;-;hard_0

9330640;Expression of Rap 1 suppresses genomic instability of H-ras transformed mouse fibroblasts.;Among the multiple genetic changes that occur during cancer progression are the activation of proto-oncogenes and the inactivation or loss of genes encoding tumor suppressors. The potential roles for these genes in the perturbation of genome stability continues to be of major interest. We have previously shown that conditional expression of H-ras in NIH3T3 cells increases genetic instability in these cells, rendering them more permissive to gene amplification and to the generation of chromosome aberrations which can be induced within a single cell cycle. In the present study we show that genetic instability induced by H-ras expression can be suppressed by co-expression of Rap 1, a Ras-related tumor suppressor gene. An NIH3T3 cell line transformed with activated human H-ras was transfected with Rap 1. Expression of the Rap 1 gene reverted the transformed cells to a flat morphology. The reverted cells reestablished contact inhibition of growth and lost the capacity to form colonies in soft agar. These cells were subsequently studied for the role of Rap 1 on the suppression of genomic instability induced by oncogenic H-ras. Cells transformed with H-ras manifest an increase in methotrexate resistance as measured by an increase in Dhfr gene amplification. Cells which concommitantly express Rap 1 showed reduced levels of methotrexate resistance as well as reduction of gene amplification capacity. Furthermore fluorescent-in-situ hybridization (FISH) with a pancentromeric mouse probe showed that elevated levels of chromosome aberrations in cells expressing H-ras were also suppressed after co-expression of Rap 1.;-;-;-;hard_0

8130281;Identification and characterization of delta B-CaM kinase and delta C-CaM kinase from rat heart, two new multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase isoforms.;We have identified, expressed and characterized two new isoforms of the multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaM kinase) cloned from rat heart. Both isoforms are variants of the neuronal delta-CaM kinase (termed delta A-CaM kinase), and are designated as delta B-CaM kinase and delta C-CaM kinase. The new isoforms differ from delta A-CaM kinase in its isoform-specific insert region, between nucleotides 984 to 1087 of the delta A-CaM kinase cDNA. Replacing these 102 nucleotides, a sequence of 33 nucleotides which code for 11 amino acids (KRKSSSSQMM) are introduced in delta B-CaM kinase. The delta C-CaM kinase lacks all 102 nucleotides and the corresponding 34 amino acids which they encode. The predicted molecular masses of the delta B- and delta C-CaM kinase isoforms are 57,697 Da and 56,446 Da, respectively. Recombinant delta-CaM kinases purified from transfected COS-7 cells were found to associate into a larger holoenzyme estimated to contain 8 to 10 subunits. The relative subunit molecular masses on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis are 59 kDa, 54 kDa and 52 kDa for delta A-, delta B- and delta C-CaM kinase, respectively. All three isoforms showed a strict dependence on Ca2+/calmodulin for activity and exhibited the Ca(2+)-dependent autophosphorylation and resultant conversion to Ca(2+)-independent kinase activity, characteristic features of multifunctional CaM kinase. Phosphopeptide analysis after partial CNBr digestion suggests that delta B-CaM kinase is the predominant soluble CaM kinase species purified from rat heart.;-;kinase activity;polyacrylamide;hard_3

8607285;Cloning, sequencing and expression of the S protein gene from two geographically distinct strains of canine coronavirus.;The gene encoding the spike (S) protein from two geographically distinct strains (American and British) of canine coronavirus (CCV) was cloned and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence revealed open reading frames of 1443 or 1453 amino acids, respectively. Structural features include an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence, a hydrophilic cysteine-rich cluster near the C-terminus, two heptad repeats and 29 or 33 potential N-glycosylation sites. Pairwise comparisons of S amino acid sequences from these isolates with other CCV strains (Insavc1 and K378) revealed that heterogeneity, found mostly in the form of conservative substitutions, is distributed throughout the canine sequences. However, 5 variable regions could be identified. Similar analysis with feline, porcine, murine, chicken and human coronavirus sequences revealed that the canine sequences are much more closely related to the feline S protein sequence than to the porcine S protein sequences even though they are all from the same antigenic group. Moreover, the sequence similarity between CCV isolates and the feline coronavirus, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) was comparable.

One third of these patients developed a second allergic reaction to penicillin. In patients experiencing a second allergic reaction the most striking feature is a dramatic increase in the immediate reactions and especially of the anaphylactic type, and less markedly, an increase in the serum-sickness type of reaction. All the patients were skin tested with penicilloyl-polylysine (PPL) and benzylpenicillin (BPO). Circulating hemagglutinating antibodies were determined and in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood lymphocytes was performed in all cases. Skin tests show little change for several years. In contrast, circulating hemagglutinating antibodies disappear in half the cases within 6 months. Finally, lymphocyte stimulation with penicillin was positive in only 50% three months after onset of the allergic reaction, whereas one year later there was a 73% positive response.

Substitution of the beta-mannosyl moiety at position 3 results in structures not capable of binding to the anti-carbohydrate antibody.

8933775;Comparison of proteins, IgE, and IgG binding antigens, and skin reactivity in commercial and laboratory-made mosquito extracts.;"BACKGROUND
Commercial extracts are available for the diagnosis and treatment of mosquito allergy, but their antigen content has never been analyzed.


OBJECTIVE
We wanted to analyze commercially available mosquito extracts and to compare these extracts with different laboratory preparations.


METHODS
Seven commercially available mosquito whole body extracts from six companies and four laboratory mosquito preparations including saliva extract were studied. Epicutaneous tests and measurement of protein concentration were performed. Protein components were identified by sodium sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and silver stain. IgE and IgG binding antigens were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with sera from mosquito-allergic subjects.


RESULTS
The seven commercial materials produced wheals and papules ranging from 0 to 36 mm2. Their protein concentrations varied from 0.1 to 4.9 mg/mL. There were significant differences in their protein and antigen components. Some extracts contained multiple highly immunoreactive proteins and IgE- and IgG-binding antigens that are not present in mosquito saliva, but few actual salivary antigens. In the four laboratory preparations, rank ordered from whole body, head and thorax, salivary gland to saliva extracts, the amount of salivary antigens significantly increased, while non-salivary proteins and antigens significantly decreased.


CONCLUSIONS
Commercial mosquito extracts should be standardized. Purer mosquito extracts should be used in diagnosis and immunotherapy of mosquito allergy.";-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
26976636;Both the Exact Target Site Sequence and a Long Poly(A) Tail Are Required for Precise Insertion of the 18S Ribosomal DNA-Specific Non-Long Terminal Repeat Retrotransposon R7Ag.;Ribosomal elements (R elements) are site-specific non-long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons that target ribosomal DNA (rDNA). To elucidate how R elements specifically access their target sites, we isolated and characterized the 18S rDNA-specific R element R7Ag from Anopheles gambiae Using an in vivo and ex vivo recombinant baculovirus retrotransposition system, we found that the exact host 18S rDNA sequence at the target site is essential for the precise insertion of R7Ag. In addition, a long poly(A) tail is necessary for the accurate initiation of R7Ag reverse transcription, a novel mechanism found in non-LTR elements. We further compared the subcellular localizations of proteins in R7Ag as well as R1Bm, another R element that targets 28S rDNA. Although the open reading frame 1 proteins (ORF1ps) of both R7Ag and R1Bm localized predominantly in the cytoplasm, ORF2 proteins (ORF2ps) colocalized in the nucleus with the nucleolar marker fibrillarin. The ORF1ps and ORF2ps of both R elements colocalized largely in the nuclear periphery and to a lesser extent within the nucleus. These results suggest that R7Ag and R1Bm proteins may access nucleolar rDNA targets in an ORF2p-dependent manner.;alanine;-;-;LCR_without_function

Two were associated with neutral glycolipids: the first, recognised by anti-myeloid antibodies VIM-1 and VIM-10, was expressed on a distinct set of glycolipids with six or more monosaccharides, and the second, recognized by VIM-8, was expressed on glycolipids with more than ten monosaccharides. The third specificity, recognised by the anti-myeloid antibody VIM-2, was expressed on slow migrating sialoglycolipids with backbone structures of the poly-N-acetyllactosamine type that are susceptible to degradation with endo-beta-galactosidase. Thus, we conclude that the i and Y antigens occur among the glycolipids of normal myeloid and chronic myelogenous leukemia cells and that a high proportion of hybridoma antibodies raised against differentiation antigens of myeloid cells are directed at carbohydrate structures.;asparagine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
12392570;Basic transcription element binding protein is a thyroid hormone-regulated transcription factor expressed during metamorphosis in Xenopus laevis.;Basic transcription element binding protein (BTEB) is a member of the Krüppel family of zinc finger transcription factors. It has been shown that BTEB plays a role in promoting neuronal process formation during postembryonic development. In the present study, the biochemical properties, transactivation function, and the developmental and hormone-regulated expression of BTEB in Xenopus laevis (xBTEB) are described. xBTEB binds the GC-rich basic transcription element (BTE) with high affinity and functions as a transcriptional activator on promoters containing multiple or single GC boxes. xBTEB mRNA levels increase in the tadpole brain, intestine and tail during metamorphosis, and are correlated with tissue-specific morphological and biochemical transformations. xBTEB mRNA expression can be induced precociously in premetamorphic tadpole tissues by treatment with thyroid hormone. In situ hybridization histochemistry showed that thyroid hormone upregulates xBTEB mRNA throughout the brain of premetamorphic tadpoles, with the highest expression found in the subventricular zones of the telencephalon, diencephalon, optic tectum, cerebellum and spinal cord. xBTEB protein parallels changes in its mRNA, and it was found that xBTEB is not expressed in mitotic cells in the developing brain, but is expressed just distal to the proliferative zone, supporting the hypothesis that this protein plays a role in neural cell differentiation. ;cysteine;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
9417689;[Which medical quality concepts should be used in Norway? Some significant quality concepts with definitions, synonyms and analogues English terms].;The terminology for quality in medical practice is over-complex, confusing and often applied indiscriminately. Such terms are meant to contribute to the understanding of medical performance and to be used as tools for its improvement. In order to be able to understand each other and to perform quality assessment a set of comprehensible terms and concise definitions of those terms is needed. This article defines and discusses in alphabetical order some of the most important Norwegian medical quality terms, giving the corresponding expressions in English. The aim of the authors is to create a Norwegian reference for medical quality terminology, modified to conform with international literature. This is a continuous process, as are other areas of quality assessment, and for the present time we recommend that these definitions be used as standard terminology for Norwegian medical quality assessment.;-;-;-;hard_0
2999142;The effects of processing inhibitors of N-linked oligosaccharides on the intracellular migration of glycoprotein E2 of mouse hepatitis virus and the maturation of coronavirus particles.;We have studied the effects of tunicamycin and inhibitors of the processing of N-linked glycans including N-methyl-1-deoxynojirimycin, castanospermine, mannodeoxynojirimycin, and swainsonine on the transport of glycoprotein E2 and the intracellular maturation of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus A59. Indirect immunofluorescence staining with monoclonal antibodies revealed that glycoprotein E2 exhibits different antigenic properties depending on the presence and on the structure of the N-linked oligosaccharides and that efficient transport of glycoprotein E2 to the plasma membrane requires the removal of glucose residues. In the presence of tunicamycin in the nonglycosylated E2 apoprotein was synthesized in normal amounts and readily acylated throughout the infectious cycle. This E2-species could not be detected on the surface of mouse hepatitis virus A59-infected cells with indirect immunofluorescence staining or lactoperoxidase labeling. N-Methyl-1-deoxynojirimycin and castanospermine, both of which selectively inhibited the processing glucosidases, caused a drop in virion formation by two log steps and a drastic delay in the surface expression of glycoprotein E2. The E2 species synthesized under such conditions was acylated but accumulated intracellularly in a compartment distinct from the Golgi. Concomitantly, synthesis of the matrix glycoprotein E1 of mouse hepatitis virus A59 was drastically impaired. Mannodeoxynojirimycin and swainsonine, which block later stages of the processing pathway, had less or no effect on the transport of glycoprotein E2 and the formation of virus particles.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
7913499;The non-NMDA subtype of excitatory amino acid receptor plays the major role in control of cardiovascular function by the subretrofacial nucleus in cats.;"Recent studies have reported that microinjection of kynurenic acid (KYN 12.5 nmol), the nonselective Excitatory Amino acid (EAA) antagonist, into the rostral ventrolateral medulla of the cat decreases arterial blood pressure (BP) and inferior cardiac sympathetic nerve discharge. The purpose of our study was to confirm this finding and determine the subtypes of EAA receptor(s) responsible for mediating this effect. This was done by microinjecting various EAA antagonists bilaterally into the SRFN of chloralose-anesthetized animals while monitoring BP and HR. KYN (12.5 nmol; N = 5) produced a decrease in mean BP (31 +/- 9 mmHg, P < .05) with no significant change in HR. To determine the subtype of EAA receptor responsible for eliciting tonic sympathetic outflow from the SRFN, specific antagonists of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA EAA receptors were tested. The NMDA receptor antagonist 3-(RS)-Carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-proyl- 1-phosphonic acid (CPP-2.25 nmol; N = 3) microinjected into the SRFN produced a small but significant decrease in BP (-13 +/- 1 mmHg; P < .05). This effect of CPP was significantly less than that seen with KYN. Two antagonists of the non-NMDA subtype of EAA receptor, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (0.05 nmol; N = 4) and gamma-D-glutamylaminomethyl sulphonic acid (2.5 nmol; N = 4), were microinjected into the SRFN. Both of these drugs produced decreases in BP (-29 +/- 4 and -23 +/- 3 mmHg, respectively; P < 0.05) similar to that observed with KYN. No significant changes in HR were noted with CPP, 6 cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione or gamma-G-glutamylamino-methylsulfonate. These data indicate that a non-NMDA EAA receptor plays the major role in control of cardiovascular function by the SRFN.";-;-;-;hard_0
1322372;Salivary receptors for GalNAc beta-sensitive adherence of Actinomyces spp.: evidence for heterogeneous GalNAc beta and proline-rich protein receptor properties.;The receptors for GalNAc beta 1-3Gal alpha Oethyl (GalNAc beta)-sensitive adherence of Actinomyces strains to salivary pellicles were investigated. Parotid and submaxillary saliva from one individual was size fractionated and utilized in hydroxyapatite adherence assays with Actinomyces naeslundii 12104 and A. viscosus 19246 and LY7 with and without GalNAc beta. Three parotid salivary fractions, the high-molecular-weight, acidic proline-rich protein (PRP), and statherin fractions, promote GalNAc beta-sensitive adherence of strain 12104, whereas only the high-molecular-weight fraction of submaxillary saliva promotes such adherence. In contrast, strain LY7, possessing a variant GalNAc beta specificity, shows GalNAc beta-sensitive adherence to the leading and trailing regions of the submaxillary PRP fractions but less distinct adherence to the parotid and submaxillary high-molecular-weight fractions. In addition, the PRP and statherin fractions promote adherence of strains LY7 and 19246 that is not inhibited by GalNAc beta. However, whereas strain LY7 binds more strongly to the PRP fraction than to the statherin fraction, strain 19246 binds preferentially to the statherin fractions of parotid and submaxillary saliva. These salivary protein fractions were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunostained to detect glycosylated proteins. The different salivary receptor properties are paralleled by different glycosylation patterns. The variable GalNAc beta specificities may have evolved to match different salivary glycosylation patterns, and PRP and statherin binding properties seem to be heterogeneous among the Actinomyces strains.;proline;-;polyacrylamide;LCR_with_hard
26742846;NusG Is a Sequence-specific RNA Polymerase Pause Factor That Binds to the Non-template DNA within the Paused Transcription Bubble.;NusG, referred to as Spt5 in archaeal and eukaryotic organisms, is the only transcription factor conserved in all three domains of life. This general transcription elongation factor binds to RNA polymerase (RNAP) soon after transcription initiation and dissociation of the RNA polymerase σ factor. Escherichia coli NusG increases transcription processivity by suppressing RNAP pausing, whereas Bacillus subtilis NusG dramatically stimulates pausing at two sites in the untranslated leader of the trpEDCFBA operon. These two regulatory pause sites participate in transcription attenuation and translational control mechanisms, respectively. Here we report that B. subtilis NusG makes sequence-specific contacts with a T-rich sequence in the non-template DNA (ntDNA) strand within the paused transcription bubble. NusG protects T residues of the recognition sequence from permanganate oxidation, and these T residues increase the affinity of NusG to the elongation complex. Binding of NusG to RNAP does not require interaction with RNA. These results indicate that bound NusG prevents forward movement of RNA polymerase by simultaneously contacting RNAP and the ntDNA strand. Mutational studies indicate that amino acid residues of two short regions within the NusG N-terminal domain are primarily responsible for recognition of the trp operon pause signals. Structural modeling indicates that these two regions are adjacent to each another in the protein. We propose that recognition of specific sequences in the ntDNA and stimulation of RNAP pausing is a conserved function of NusG-like transcription factors.  ;threonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
4084525;Preparation, detection, and characterization of an antibody to rat alpha-phosphophoryn.;The phosphophoryn components of rat incisor dentin were extracted under stringent conditions to prevent proteolytic degradation during processing. Successive steps of CaCl2 precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration over Biosil TSK G4000SW high-performance liquid chromatography columns in 4.0 M guanidine hydrochloride yielded a mixture of phosphoryns that contained only trace amounts of other proteins, as shown by a very sensitive double stain procedure on acrylamide gels after electrophoresis. The highest weight phosphophoryn had a molecular weight of 90 000, on gradient polyacrylamide gels calibrated with globular protein standards. Polyclonal antibodies were produced in rabbits following a complex scheme. The specific antibodies were collected by passage over a Sepharose column conjugated to the purified phosphophoryn. The isolated antibody was used to prepare a second affinity column. Passage of the initial phosphophoryn fraction over the column led to the retention of a single component, identified as the Mr 90 000 alpha-phosphophoryn. Thus, a monospecific polyclonal antibody has been prepared. These data show that the other phosphoryns of the rat incisor must be distinct species or slightly degraded products of the alpha-phosphophoryn lacking the antigenic epitope of the antibody prepared.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
7580267;New assays for the measurement of serum antibodies reactive with eye muscle membrane antigens confirm their significance in thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy.;Although sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blotting are widely used to detect serum antibodies in patients with autoimmune disorders, this procedure unfolds and denatures proteins and may alter antibody binding sites. We have used nondenaturing methods for the purification of a 64-kDa eye muscle (EM) membrane antigen associated with thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO). Pig EM membrane proteins were prepared from crude homogenates by high-speed centrifugation and solubilized by hand homogenization. The 64-kDa protein was further purified by isoelectric focusing performed in the absence of SDS, detergents, reducing agents, and urea. Sera from patients with active TAO of recent onset and thyroid autoimmunity without ophthalmopathy were tested for reactivity against purified native 64-kDa protein in immunoblotting. Tests were positive in 64% of patients with TAO, in 37.5% of those with Graves' hyperthyroidism without eye disease, in 11% of patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis without eye disease, and in 13% of normal subjects. Many of the same sera were also tested for cytotoxic activity against human EM cells in an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) assay. ADCC tests were positive in 69% of patients with TAO but in no normal subject. The specificity and sensitivity of these two tests in TAO surpass those for all other published results for orbital tissue reactive autoantibodies. Although there was a tendency for a relationship between reactivity to the 64-kDa protein and cytotoxic activity against EM cells in ADCC there were many exceptions and overall the relationship between the two tests was not significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS);-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
2007510;[Comparison of the adverse effect profile of different substances such as penicillins, tetracyclines, sulfonamides and quinolones].;"The penicillins, the tetracyclines and the sulfonamides have often been used in the last few decades in spite of their well-known side effects. Hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins are among the most important adverse reactions in these antibiotics; in every case a careful medical history has to be taken before a new course of penicillin treatment. The use of tetracyclines in women during the last six months of pregnancy or in children under the age of eight years is contraindicated. Patients with severe blood, kidney or liver disease should not be treated with sulfonamides. Toxic reactions to penicillin even with convulsions may occur in patients with renal insufficiency if the dosage is not adapted. The fluoroquinolones do not seem to have greater risks regarding adverse reactions than the historical compounds mentioned. Neurotoxicity is an important problem. Mild reactions are reported with incidences under 2%; severe neurotoxic side effects that require interruption of therapy are rare. Psychotic reactions, hallucinations, depressions and grand mal convulsions also belong to this category. Other side effects (skin, GI-tract) are no more frequent than with the classical antibiotics. In patients with renal insufficiency the dosage of ofloxacin has to be adapted. The cartilage lesions which are seen in juvenile rats and dogs raise the question whether or not the cases of arthralgia during therapy with older quinolones as well as under treatment with fluoroquinolones have a causal relationship. Up to date quinolones should not be prescribed in children and young adults except in cases with cystic fibrosis. The development of resistance has not been a significant problem so far.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)";isoleucine;-;-;LCR_without_function
8601586;Identification, localization, and functional implications of an abundant nematode annexin.;Cultures of the nematode C. elegans were examined for the presence of calcium-dependent, phospholipid-binding proteins of the annexin class. A single protein of apparent mass on SDS-polyacrylamide gels of 32 kD was isolated from soluble extracts of nematode cultures on the basis of its ability to bind to phospholipids in a calcium-dependent manner. After verification of the protein as an annexin by peptide sequencing, an antiserum to the protein was prepared and used to isolate a corresponding cDNA from an expression library in phage lambda gt11. The encoded protein, herein referred to as the nex-1 annexin, has a mass of 35 kD and is 36-42% identical in sequence to 10 known mammalian annexins. Several unique modifications were found in the portions of the sequence corresponding to calcium-binding sites. Possible phosphorylation sites in the NH2-terminal domain of the nematode annexin correspond to those of mammalian annexins. The gene for this annexin (nex-1) was physically mapped to chromosome III in the vicinity of the dpy-17 genetic marker. Two other annexin genes (nex-2 and nex-3) were also identified in chromosome III sequences reported by the nematode genomic sequencing project (Sulston, J., Z. Du, K. Thomas, R. Wilson, L. Hillier, R. Staden, N. Halloran, P. Green, J. Thierry-Mieg, L. Qiu, et al. 1992. Nature (Lond.). 356:37-41). The nex-1 annexin was localized in the nematode by immunofluorescence and by electron microscopy using immunogold labeling. The protein is associated with membrane systems of the secretory gland cells of the pharynx, with sites of cuticle formation in the grinder in the pharynx, with yolk granules in oocytes, with the uterine wall and vulva, and with membrane systems in the spermathecal valve. The presence of the annexin in association with the membranes of the spermathecal valve suggests a novel function of the protein in the folding and unfolding of these membranes as eggs pass through the valve. The localizations also indicate roles for the annexin corresponding to those proposed in mammalian systems in membrane trafficking, collagen deposition, and extracellular matrix formation.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
6185420;Isolation and characterization of the sheep erythrocyte receptor for acholeplasmal lipoglycans.;A receptor specific for lipoglycans from Acholeplasma axanthum and Acholeplasma granularum was isolated from sheep erythrocyte stroma by extraction with n-pentanol and permeation chromatography. The purified receptor appeared as one band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie blue, periodate-Schiff reagent, and Sudan black. It was distinct from the erythrocyte receptor for gram-negative lipopolysaccharides and the glycophorin receptor for certain species of Mycoplasma. Periodate oxidation and trypsin did not affect the receptor activity in intact erythrocytes, but the purified receptor was susceptible to proteolytic digestion. Specific receptors, sensitive to trypsin digestion, could be isolated from rabbit kidney and cultured rabbit epidermal cell membranes. These could be distinguished from the receptor from erythrocytes by their solubility in n-pentanol.

3747491;Targeting of tumor-associated antigens (TAA) in experimental immunotherapy.;"We have previously shown the superiority of tumor-associated antigens (TAA) to function as effective immunogens when administered with bilayer membrane vesicles called liposomes. The ability of liposomes to target TAA to host antigen-presenting cells is analyzed here. 1-Butanol extracted TAA from two syngeneic rat colon cancer tumors (WB 2054 and W 1756) was radioiodinated (131I-TAA). Free 131I and 131I-TAA (2.8 X 10(7) cpm and 75 micrograms TAA per rat) were used as tracers, with or without incorporation into liposomes (composition: sphingomyelin, cholesterol, dicetyl phosphate at 70:24:6 molar ratio). Six groups of male rats (BN X WF for WB2054 and Wistar/Furth for W1756, n = 18 each group) were injected iv with either free tracers or the tracers incorporated into liposomes. Whole blood clearance curve was biphasic (half-life alpha = 5 min; half life beta = 12 hr), suggesting a two-compartmental model of distribution. Seven animals from each group were sacrificed at set times (15 min to 48 hr), organs harvested and cpm/g of tissue estimated. Liposome 131I and liposome 131I-TAA were targeted to and retained preferentially in liver and spleen. Four animals from each group were imaged serially using a gamma camera. Matched pair analysis of regions showed persistently higher activity in liver-spleen area when liposomes were used (P less than 0.001). The uptake of radiolabeled antigens by plastic adherent mononuclear cells in liver and spleen was significantly higher when presented with liposomes (macrophage uptake index: liver = 1.65 vs 0.55; spleen = 5.85 vs 1.15; with and without liposomes, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)";-;antigen;-;hard_2

1724905;Components of the multicatalytic proteinase complex.;The multicatalytic proteinase complex is a high molecular weight nonlysosomal proteinase. Kinetic studies of the proteolytic activities of the complex have shown that there are at least three distinct types of catalytic centre, each of which has a different specificity. All of the activities can be inhibited by the serine protease inhibitor 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin. Viewed under the electron microscope, the multicatalytic proteinase purified from rat liver appears to have a hollow cylindrical structure. It is composed of many different types of subunit and on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels gives rise to a complex pattern of about 20 spots with pI values ranging between 5 and 8.5 and molecular masses between 22 and 34 kDa. Immunoblot analysis has shown that many of the major polypeptides are antigenically distinct. However, there are some relationships between the proteinase polypeptides. For example, although N-terminal sequences of five of the polypeptides are unique, they show considerable sequence similarity suggesting that these proteins are encoded by members of the same gene family. Also, there is some cross-reactivity between certain polypeptides when blots are probed with affinity purified, subunit-specific antisera. In addition to the variety of polypeptide components of the proteinase, a small RNA species (80 nucleotides) can be found associated with the complex even after purification by chromatographic procedures.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3

The heavy chain of slow red myosin migrated electrophoretically more slowly than the heavy chains of the other myosins and differed markedly from them in its peptide maps. The heavy chain of dystrophic fast white myosin was similar to its normal counterpart by peptide mapping but showed slight differences. The peptide map of the heavy chain of embryonic presumptive fast white myosin had the general features of that of the heavy chain of fast white, not slow red, fibers but contained definite differences from the former.

Electrospray mass spectrometric analysis of samples of the isolated subcomponents prepared by ion exchange chromatography showed that each was composed of three glycoproteins and that the major difference between the subcomponents was due to their constituent glycoproteins possessing different numbers of sialic acid residues. Combined analysis of the ESI-MS data and of the overall carbohydrate compositional data obtained by colorimetric procedures, leads to the composition of the glycan of each glycoprotein, and a combined methylation and 400 MHz H-NMR analysis of the alkaline cleaved glycans identified them as being of only the biantennary N-acetyllactosamine type.

29070515;Flavan-3-ols Are an Effective Chemical Defense against Rust Infection.;Phenolic secondary metabolites are often thought to protect plants against attack by microbes, but their role in defense against pathogen infection in woody plants has not been investigated comprehensively. We studied the biosynthesis, occurrence, and antifungal activity of flavan-3-ols in black poplar (Populus nigra), which include both monomers, such as catechin, and oligomers, known as proanthocyanidins (PAs). We identified and biochemically characterized three leucoanthocyanidin reductases and two anthocyanidin reductases from P. nigra involved in catalyzing the last steps of flavan-3-ol biosynthesis, leading to the formation of catechin [2,3-trans-(+)-flavan-3-ol] and epicatechin [2,3-cis-(-)-flavan-3-ol], respectively. Poplar trees that were inoculated with the biotrophic rust fungus (Melampsora larici-populina) accumulated higher amounts of catechin and PAs than uninfected trees. The de novo-synthesized catechin and PAs in the rust-infected poplar leaves accumulated significantly at the site of fungal infection in the lower epidermis. In planta concentrations of these compounds strongly inhibited rust spore germination and reduced hyphal growth. Poplar genotypes with constitutively higher levels of catechin and PAs as well as hybrid aspen (Populus tremula × Populus alba) overexpressing the MYB134 transcription factor were more resistant to rust infection. Silencing PnMYB134, on the other hand, decreased flavan-3-ol biosynthesis and increased susceptibility to rust infection. Taken together, our data indicate that catechin and PAs are effective antifungal defenses in poplar against foliar rust infection.;-;transcription factor;-;hard_2
19307711;Structure, modifications and ligand-binding properties of rat profilin 2a.;"Profilins are key regulators of the actin microfilament system and in neuronal tissues the profilin 2a isoform is the most abundant and important profilin. The high-resolution crystal structure of rat profilin 2a has been determined in the absence of ligands. By comparing the structure with those of peptide-liganded profilin 2a and unliganded profilin 2b, it can be concluded that the binding site for proline-rich peptides is pre-organized. The C-terminus of profilin 2a is also well ordered in the absence of ligand peptide, in contrast to the 2b isoform which is generated by alternative splicing. Covalent modifications of four cysteine residues were also detected in profilin 2a, as well as a number of other modifications in profilin 2 from rat brain; such modifications could significantly affect the function of profilin. It was also shown that profilin 2a binds to the neuronal protein palladin, including a synthetic palladin peptide; peptides from another profilin ligand, dynamin 1, failed to interact with both profilin 1 and profilin 2a.

The avian hormone had the same SDS electrophoretic mobility as bovine parathyroid hormone (bPTH) and therefore a similar molecular weight. The avian peptide was lower than bPTH in basic amino acids and considerably higher in glycine.

7756285;1H, 13C, and 15N NMR resonance assignments, secondary structure, and backbone topology of a variant of human interleukin-3.;Interleukin-3 (IL-3) is a cytokine which stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors into multiple cell lineages. The 1H, 15N, and 13C NMR resonances of a recombinant human IL-3 variant (SC-65369) have been assigned using two- and three-dimensional NMR techniques on uniformly 13C/15N-enriched protein. Five helical segments (residues 16-26, 42-50, 55-65, 73-82, and 104-120) and three reverse turns (residues 51-54, 68-71, and 87-90) were identified from the pattern of sequential NOE connectivities, NH(i)-C alpha H(i) scalar coupling constants (3JNH alpha), amide hydrogen exchange data, and the deviation of 13C alpha, 13C beta, 13CO, and C alpha H chemical shifts from random-coil values. Long-range NOEs indicate that the global folding pattern of human IL-3 is a four-helical bundle with an up-up-down-down arrangement of helices that is similar to that of other members of the cytokine family, such as granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). A fifth short helix (helix A', residues 42-50) is located in the loop connecting the first and second helices. The absence of helix A' in the corresponding structures of GM-CSF and interleukin-5 suggests that it may be important for recognition of IL-3 by its receptor. The existence of at least two forms of the protein that differ in local conformation was implied from the observation of a limited set of doubled resonances in which each doublet partner had a similar pattern of short-, medium-, and long-range NOEs. The majority of the doubled resonances were close in sequence or space to a proline-rich sequence, which suggested that the different conformational forms of SC-65369 may be caused by slow cis-trans isomerization of proline peptide bonds. ;proline;helix;-;LCR_with_function

Guinea-pig antiviral immunoglobulins as the secondary antibodies, and horseradish peroxidase-labelled swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (EIA), or 125I-labelled sheep anti-rabbit IgG (RIA) as the indicator antibodies. A total of 174 nasopharyngeal specimens collected by mucus extractor were tested, and the results were compared with those obtained by a routinely used immunofluorescence (IF) technique. The same number of positive specimens were achieved by the EIA and the RIA and 3/4, 4/4, and 19/20 immunofluorescence (IF)-positive nasopharyngeal specimens were positive by the parainfluenza type 1, 2 and 3 immunoassays respectively. In addition, four parainfluenza type 1 and three parainfluenza type 3 virus-positive specimens were found by the immunoassays out of 146 parainfluenza IF-negative specimens. The type-specificities of the parainfluenza immunoassays were confirmed by showing that no cross-reactions occurred when purified immunizing antigens and the EIA- and RIA-positive clinical specimens were cross-tested. The results indicate that parainfluenza type-specific antigens can be detected directly in nasopharyngeal specimens by the immunoassays and the preliminary findings with a small number of positive specimens suggest that these assays have a diagnostic potential which is similar or slightly better than the IF techniques.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
9091528;Sustained local delivery of dexamethasone by a novel intravascular eluting stent to prevent restenosis in the porcine coronary injury model.;"OBJECTIVES
This study sought to assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of sustained intracoronary delivery of dexamethasone by a novel polymer-coated eluting stent.


BACKGROUND
Development of techniques to provide sustained local drug delivery has focused on polymers as matrices for drug incorporation and elution.


METHODS
A tantalum wire stent was coated with dexamethasone (0.8 mg) suspended in a matrix of either low (approximately 80 kD) or high (approximately 321 kD) molecular weight poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA [0.4 mg]). Uncoated stents, stents coated with PLLA or stents coated with dexamethasone in PLLA were overexpanded by 30% to the normal vessel diameter in the coronary arteries of juvenile farm pigs. Animals were euthanized 28 days later, and neointimal thicknesses were measured. Additional pigs underwent placement of stents coated with high molecular weight PLLA-dexamethasone for assessment of arterial tissue and serum concentrations of dexamethasone at 1 h and 1, 2, 10 and 28 days after stent implantation.


RESULTS
In vitro dexamethasone release occurred over the first 6 days. Stents coated with low molecular weight PLLA produced an intense inflammatory neointimal response. Stents utilizing the high molecular weight PLLA were well tolerated within the coronary vessel during the 28-day experiment. However, dexamethasone did not decrease neointimal hyperplasia. Dexamethasone concentrations in the arterial tissue were approximately 300,000-fold higher than those in the serum 24 h after stent implantation, remaining approximately 3,000-fold higher at 28 days.


CONCLUSIONS
The eluting stent utilizing high molecular weight PLLA appeared to be a well tolerated and effective means of providing sustained, site-specific drug delivery to the porcine coronary artery wall for at least 28 days.";-;-;poly-L-;hard_1
15578275;Expression and distribution of transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein in the central nervous system of Lymnaea stagnalis.;The transcription factor, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP), is involved in important physiological processes, such as cellular proliferation and differentiation, homeostasis, and higher-order functions of the brain. In the present study, we investigated the distribution of mRNA and protein of C/EBP in the central nervous system of the pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis, by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Specificity of the anti-mammalian C/EBP antibody against Lymnaea C/EBP (LymC/EBP) was confirmed by combination of sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or isoelectric focusing and immunoblotting. Cells positive for in situ hybridization were immunoreactive for LymC/EBP in all 11 ganglia. The motoneurons (B1, B2, B4, and B4 clusters) in the buccal ganglia and interneurons (cerebral giant cell, CGC) in the cerebral ganglia were positive for in situ hybridization and were immunopositive. In the pedal ganglion, the right pedal dorsal 1 (RPeD1), pedal A, and pedal C clusters exhibited positive signals of in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry for LymC/EBP. CGC and RPeD1 are key neurons for associative learning. In addition, the neuropeptidergic cells in the cerebral, pleural, parietal, and visceral ganglia were positive for in situ hybridization and immunoreactive. Interestingly, although the cytoplasm of almost all immunopositive cells was stained, some neuropeptidergic cells located in the light parietal and visceral ganglia exhibited immunoreactivity in nuclei. Our results suggest that LymC/EBP is involved in learning and memory and in the expression and/or secretion of neuropeptides in Lymnaea.;-;transcription factor;polyacrylamide;hard_3
839069;Alternative pathway of complement: nonenzymatic, reversible transition of precursor to active properdin.;A method for the purification of properdin in precursor state (pre-P) has been elaborated. Precursor properdin, in contrast to activated properdin (P), does not initiate the formation of a C3 convertase when added to properdin-depleted serum, rather it requires the presence of an activating substance such as zymosan for expression of its activity. Comparing the activities of pre-P and P it was found that some P preparations contained significant amounts of pre-P because they were fully active only in the presence of zymosan. This observation indicated that P can partly revert to pre-P. Comparison by immunoelectrophoresis and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed no charge or size differences between pre-P and P. Radiolabeled pre-P, when analyzed after its participation in the reactions of the pathway, displayed an unchanged subunit m.w. of 50,000. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the transition of pre-P to P is due to a partly reversible change in the conformation of the protein rather than the result of proteolytic cleavage.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1

Partial DNA sequences of these loci encompassing the first 120 nucleotides of the putative coding region are reported. One positive clone was further analyzed by sequencing a 3.1 kb XbaI fragment. This clone displays the characteristics of a pseudogene, i.e. lack of introns and several nucleotide insertions and deletions.

8029203;Solution structure of the DNA binding octapeptide repeat of the K10 gene product.;"A putative transcription factor, the Drosophila K10 gene product, contains eight repeats of the octapeptide sequence SPNQQQHP or close variants. The solution structure of the K10 repeat was studied by NMR using a peptide composed of two SPNQQQHP units (referred to here as HP2). To overcome problems caused by degeneracy of backbone amide signals of Gln residues, a series of synthetic peptides containing an 15N-labelled main chain amide at different positions in HP2 were synthesized. In aqueous trifluoroethanol solution, HP2 folds into two structural units; the SPNQ part of each unit folds into a turn structure, while the C-terminal part shows some helical characteristics but is less structured. The N-terminal turn is likely to provide a core that produces a more stable helical structure upon binding to DNA and probably 'caps' the segmented helical unit at its N-terminus. This model is supported by a DNA footprinting study which shows that one SPNQQQHP unit spans four base pairs upon binding to A/T-rich sequences of DNA.

29038245;Mitochondrial Calcium Dysregulation Contributes to Dendrite Degeneration Mediated by PD/LBD-Associated LRRK2 Mutants.;Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) contribute to development of late-onset familial Parkinson's disease (PD), with clinical features of motor and cognitive dysfunction indistinguishable from sporadic PD. Calcium dysregulation plays an important role in PD pathogenesis, but the mechanisms of neurodegeneration remain unclear. Recent reports indicate enhanced excitatory neurotransmission in cortical neurons expressing mutant LRRK2, which occurs before the well-characterized phenotype of dendritic shortening. As mitochondria play a major role in the rapid buffering of cytosolic calcium, we hypothesized that altered mitochondrial calcium handling contributes to dendritic retraction elicited by the LRRK2-G2019S and -R1441C mutations. In primary mouse cortical neurons, we observed increased depolarization-induced mitochondrial calcium uptake. We found that expression of mutant LRRK2 elicited transcriptional upregulation of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) and the mitochondrial calcium uptake 1 protein (MICU1) with no change in levels of the mitochondrial calcium antiporter NCLX. Elevated MCU and MICU1 were also observed in LRRK2-mutated patient fibroblasts, along with increased mitochondrial calcium uptake, and in postmortem brains of sporadic PD/PDD patients of both sexes. Transcriptional upregulation of MCU and MICU1 was caused by activation of the ERK1/2 (MAPK3/1) pathway. Inhibiting ERK1/2 conferred protection against mutant LRRK2-induced neurite shortening. Pharmacological inhibitors or RNAi knockdown of MCU attenuated mitochondrial calcium uptake and dendritic/neuritic shortening elicited by mutant LRRK2, whereas expression of a constitutively active mutant of NCLX that enhances calcium export from mitochondria was neuroprotective. These data suggest that an increased susceptibility to mitochondrial calcium dysregulation contributes to dendritic injury in mutant LRRK2 pathogenesis.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Cognitive dysfunction and dementia are common features of Parkinson's disease (PD), causing significant disability. Mutations in LRRK2 represent the most common known genetic cause of PD. We found that PD-linked LRRK2 mutations increased dendritic and mitochondrial calcium uptake in cortical neurons and familial PD patient fibroblasts, accompanied by increased expression of the mitochondrial calcium transporter MCU. Blocking the ERK1/2-dependent upregulation of MCU conferred protection against mutant LRRK2-elicited dendrite shortening, as did inhibiting MCU-mediated calcium import. Conversely, stimulating the export of calcium from mitochondria was also neuroprotective. These results implicate increased susceptibility to mitochondrial calcium overload in LRRK2-driven neurodegeneration, and suggest possible interventions that may slow the progression of cognitive dysfunction in PD.;leucine;-;-;LCR_without_function
1709822;Reactivity of an anti-(human gastric carcinoma) monoclonal antibody with core-related peptides of gastrointestinal mucin.;"A murine anti-(human gastric carcinoma) monoclonal antibody, GL-013 (IgG1), which reacts with a high-molecular-mass glycoprotein from colorectal tumour tissue [Yang and Price (1989) Anticancer Res 9: 1707], was examined for reactivity against a panel of purified and partially purified antigens associated with tumours of the gastrointestinal tract. These included carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), normal cross-reacting antigen, Y-hapten glycoproteins, and perchloric acid extracts and glycolipid preparations from colorectal tumours. While the GL-013 antibody failed to bind to these antigens, it was found to react strongly with synthetic peptides with sequences based upon that reported for the protein core of a human gastrointestinal mucin [Barnd et al. (1989) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 86: 7159; Gum et al. (1989) J Biol Chem 264: 6480]. In control tests, a series of other anti-(colorectal tumour) antibodies (IgG1 and IgG3), with broad reactivity towards gastrointestinal carcinomas, as well as an anti-CEA antibody, (IgG1) failed to react with the synthetic peptides. It is concluded that the anti-(gastric carcinoma) monoclonal antibody GL-013 binds to a threonine-rich peptide epitope expressed within the protein core of gastrointestinal mucins.";threonine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
12966074;The apoptosis-inducing protein kinase DRAK2 is inhibited in a calcium-dependent manner by the calcium-binding protein CHP.;Calcineurin homologous protein (CHP) is an EF-hand Ca(2+)-binding protein capable of interacting with various cellular proteins including Na(+)/H(+) exchangers, kinesin-related proteins, and apoptosis-inducing protein kinase DRAK2. We investigated the role of CHP on the DRAK2 protein kinase in vitro. CHP significantly reduced (approximately 85% inhibition) the kinase activity of DRAK2 for both autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of exogenous substrate (myosin light chain). The inhibitory effect of CHP was dependent on the presence of Ca(2+), whereas the interaction between CHP and DRAK2 was not Ca(2+)-dependent. These observations suggest that CHP negatively regulates the apoptosis-inducing protein kinase DRAK2 in a manner that depends on intracellular Ca(2+)-concentration.;-;kinase activity;-;hard_2

Occult metastatic tumor, undetectable in hematoxylin and eosin stained slides, but visible by immunohistochemistry, was detected in 23 of 80 patients (29 per cent). Occult tumor was observed in patients with invasive ductal carcinoma (21/76-28 per cent) and in individuals with invasive lobular carcinoma (2/4-50 per cent). In patients with occult metastases the primary tumors were slightly larger (mean 2.39 cm, range 1.00-5.00 cm) than those of patients whose nodes were negative for tumor cells (mean, 2.03 cm, range, 0.60-4.50 cm). Information concerning clinical outcome is available for 61 patients followed for between 1 and 7 years (mean 3.2 years). Three of 17 patients (18 per cent) who had occult tumor in the nodes developed distant metastases, all less than 3 years after initial surgery. One of the 44 patients (2 per cent) whose nodes were free of occult tumor developed distant metastases 5 years following surgery. Local recurrences in the area of the mastectomy occurred in one of 17 patients with occult nodal tumor (6 per cent), less than 1 year after surgery.

6479208;MHC- and non-MHC-encoded surface antigens of chicken lymphoid cells and erythrocytes recognized by polyclonal xeno-, allo- and monoclonal antibodies.;"Surface antigens on chicken thymus and bursa cells were analyzed by immunoprecipitation using polyclonal and monoclonal antisera raised against (and specific for) thymus (ATS) or bursa (ABS) cells, respectively. The antigens identified were compared with those governed by the B-F, B-L and B-G regions of the chicken major histocompatibility complex (B complex). Four proteins were precipitated from thymus cells by 2 polyclonal ATS: both antisera recognized molecules of apparent molecular mass of 172-182, 132-135, 75-76 kDa, and one antiserum in addition recognized a protein of 102 kDa. The 172-182 and 102-kDa peaks were still demonstrable under reducing conditions indicating that they are composed of a single polypeptide chain, the other 2 were lost under reducing conditions, therefore, must be composed of smaller subunits. Of the 2 monoclonal ATS tested, one identified a single protein of 186 kDa and the other a 135-kDa protein (in addition to 2 smaller molecules); whether these are the same as those precipitated by the polyclonal antisera remains to be determined as they behaved differently under reducing conditions. Proteins of 162 and 78-84 kDa were revealed by 2 polyclonal ABS under nonreducing conditions but the former may in one case be a polymer (it disappeared under reducing conditions) and in the other a single molecule. In addition molecules of 182 kDa were identified by one antiserum and of 84 and 60 kDa by the other under nonreducing conditions. Of the 4 monoclonal ABS only one identified a 200-kDa protein: molecules of 115-125, 90-100, 48-52 and 40-43 kDa were also precipitated, all of which were reduced to smaller molecules. With 2 specific anti-B-F alloantisera we were able to precipitate the ""conventional"" B-F antigen from red blood cell lysates of CB-strain chickens resolving into a 40-kDa peak and a light chain of about 12 kDa corresponding to beta 2 microglobulin. Precipitates from peripheral blood lymphocytes, bursa and thymus cells revealed an additional protein of 22 kDa. With 2 specific B-L alloantisera two peaks of 33 kDa and 31 kDa were obtained from peripheral blood lymphocytes. Using anti-B-G alloantisera a double band corresponding to 47 and 42 kDa was seen under reducing conditions. There is no evidence from these data to indicate that the polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies are directed towards major histocompatibility complex antigens.";-;antigen;-;hard_2
12956955;Whorl-specific expression of the SUPERMAN gene of Arabidopsis is mediated by cis elements in the transcribed region.;"The SUPERMAN (SUP) gene of Arabidopsis is involved in controlling cell proliferation in stamen and carpel primordia and in ovules during flower development. The SUP gene encodes a transcription factor with a C2H2-type zinc finger motif, a serine/proline-rich domain, a basic domain, and a leucine-zipper-like domain and is expressed in a very limited region in stamen primordia and in the developing ovary during flower development. The SUP gene is susceptible to methylation, resulting in epigenetic gene silencing. To understand how the SUP gene is expressed spatially and temporally in its restricted domain, and why methylation of the transcribed region affects early-stage SUP expression, we have identified the SUP cis regulatory elements by characterizing SUP gene fusions. These studies show that the SUP gene has discrete upstream promoter elements required for expression in stamen primordia in early stages and in the ovary in later stages. The promoter activity for stamen primordia is modulated by several positive and negative elements located in the transcribed and translated regions. Several regulatory elements in the transcribed region correlate with the areas of the gene that are heavily methylated in epigenetic alleles; these data provide a possible explanation of how methylation of the transcribed region represses transcription.

10202158;TAP binds to the constitutive transport element (CTE) through a novel RNA-binding motif that is sufficient to promote CTE-dependent RNA export from the nucleus.;The constitutive transport element (CTE) of the simian type D retroviruses overcomes nuclear retention and allows nuclear export of unspliced viral RNAs by recruiting TAP, a host factor which is thought to be required for export of cellular mRNAs. In this report, we show that the first 372 amino acid residues of TAP, comprising a stretch of leucine-rich repeats, are both necessary and sufficient for binding to the CTE RNA and promoting its export to the cytoplasm. Moreover, like the full-length protein, this domain migrates to the cytoplasm upon nuclear co-injection with the CTE RNA. Together, these results indicate that the CTE-binding domain includes the signals for nuclear export. We also describe a derivative of TAP that bears a triple amino acid substitution within the CTE-binding domain and substantially reduces the export of mRNAs from the nucleus. This provides further evidence for a role for TAP in this process. Thus, the CTE-binding domain of TAP defines a novel RNA-binding motif which has dual functions, both recognizing the CTE RNA and interacting with other components of the nuclear transport machinery. ;leucine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
7852838;In vitro and in vivo effects of pentoxifylline on macrophages and lymphocytes derived from autoimmune MRL-lpr/lpr mice.;MRL-lpr/lpr mice develop an autoimmune disease similar to human systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The main characteristics of this disease are increasing autoantibody formation, elevated plasma levels of immune complexes, a massive lymphoproliferation, a rising proteinuria, and arthritic symptoms. Finally, the mice die at an age of about 6 months due to a fatal immune complex glomerulonephritis. Macrophages are involved in the development of SLE due to their functions as antigen-presenting as well as cytokine-producing cells. T and B cells are involved in the disease by secreting cytokines and producing antibodies. Pentoxifylline (PTX), a xanthine derivative, is known to exert different effects on functions of leukocytes and erythrocytes and has been used in clinical studies, e.g., in septic shock syndrome. In our studies we first investigated the in vitro effect of PTX on macrophages and lymphocytes derived from MRL-lpr mice. Our investigations concerning production of superoxide anion and TNF-alpha by LPS and/or IFN-gamma activated bone marrow and peritoneal macrophages, MHC class II expression on these cells, and the proliferative capacity and Il-2 production of mitogen activated lymphocytes, revealed that PTX reduces the activation and the inflammatory response of these cells. Based on these results, we further investigated the effect of in vivo treatment with PTX. MRL-lpr mice treated with PTX showed diminished proteinuria, reduced titer of dsDNA-autoantibodies in the plasma and an increased survival rate. Our data clearly demonstrate that PTX is able to diminish the severity of the disease and to prolong the life of MRL-lpr/lpr mice.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
23994011;Two singular types of CCCH tandem zinc finger in Nab2p contribute to polyadenosine RNA recognition.;The seven C-terminal CCCH-type zinc fingers of Nab2p bind the poly(A) tail of mRNA (∼A25). Using NMR, we demonstrated that the first four (Zf1-Zf4) contain two structurally independent tandems (TZF12 and TZF34) and bind A12 with moderate affinity (KD = 2.3 μM). Nab2p TZF12 contains a long α helix that contacts the zinc fingers Zf1 and Zf2 to arrange them similarly to Zf6-7 in the Nab2p Zf5-7 structure. Nab2p TZF34 exhibits a distinctive two-fold symmetry of the zinc centers with mutual recognition of histidine ligands. Our mutagenesis and NMR data demonstrate that the α helix of TZF12 and Zf3 of TZF34 define the RNA-binding interface, while Zf1, Zf2, and Zf4 seem to be excluded. These results further our understanding of polyadenosine RNA recognition by the CCCH domain of Nab2p.

1658787;Alternative splicing and genomic structure of the Wilms tumor gene WT1.;The chromosome 11p13 Wilms tumor susceptibility gene WT1 appears to play a crucial role in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of nephroblasts and gonadal tissue. The WT1 gene consists of 10 exons, encoding a complex pattern of mRNA species: four distinct transcripts are expressed, reflecting the presence or absence of two alternative splices. Splice I consists of a separate exon, encoding 17 amino acids, which is inserted between the proline-rich amino terminus and the zinc finger domains. Splice II arises from the use of an alternative 5' splice junction and results in the insertion of 3 amino acids between zinc fingers 3 and 4. RNase protection analysis demonstrates that the most prevalent splice variant in both human and mouse is that which contains both alternative splices, whereas the least common is the transcript missing both splices. The relative distribution of splice variants is highly conserved between normal fetal kidney tissue and Wilms tumors that have intact WT1 transcripts. The ratio of these different WT1 mRNA species is also maintained as a function of development in the mouse kidney and in various mouse tissues expressing WT1. The conservation in structure and relative levels of each of the four WT1 mRNA species suggests that each encoded polypeptide makes a significant contribution to normal gene function. The control of cellular proliferation and differentiation exerted by the WT1 gene products may involve interactions between four polypeptides with distinct targets and functions.;proline;zinc finger;-;LCR_with_function
9331218;Visualization of single neurofilaments by immunofluorescence microscopy of splayed axonal cytoskeletons.;Treatment of cultured neurons with non-ionic detergents under certain conditions causes the axonal microtubules to splay apart from each other, allowing individual microtubules to be visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy [Brown et al., 1993, J. Cell Sci. 104: 339-352]. I have investigated whether axonal neurofilaments separate from each other under similar conditions. Cultures of dissociated dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons from fetal rats were treated with non-ionic detergent and fixed with formaldehyde. Neurofilaments were visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy using a polyclonal antiserum specific for NF-L. Treatment of the neurons with Triton X-100 or saponin caused filamentous structures to splay apart from each other along the entire length of the axon. Quantitative analysis of fluorescence intensity along the filamentous structures indicated that many of them represent single neurofilaments and that single and bundled neurofilaments can be distinguished based on their fluorescence intensity. The extent of this splaying phenomenon was dependent on time and detergent concentration. Temporal analysis indicated that short portions of single neurofilaments initially loop out from the axonal bundle and then subsequently splay apart further along their length and adhere to the polylysine/laminin coated substrate. The maximum observed length for a single axonal neurofilament was 183 microm in neurons after only 1 day in culture, which indicates that neurofilaments can attain remarkable lengths in these young cultured neurons. The splayed axonal cytoskeleton preparation described here allows individual axonal neurofilaments to be visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy, which is not possible in conventional preparations due to the dense packing of these polymers in axons.;lysine;-;-;LCR_without_function

518308;Interferon induction with Newcastle disease virus in FS-4 cells: effect of 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB).;DRB is an inhibitor of heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA) and messenger RNA (MRNA) synthesis. The effect of DRB on interferon production stimulated by Newcastle disease virus (NDV) in the human FS-4 cells was studied. Interferon production in cells primed by treatment with interferon was markedly enhanced (superinduced) in the presence of DRB. This superinduction was essentially due to an inhibition of the rapid decline (shutoff) of interferon production observed in primed cells not treated with DRB. Continuous presence of DRB was required for maximal superinduction. In this and other respects the interferon response induced by NDV in primed cells resembled poly(I). poly(C)-induced interferon production. In contrast interferon production in cells not primed with interferon was virtually abolished by DRB treatment. Since neither virus specific RNA synthesis nor virus replication were significantly affected by DRB, the inhibition of interferon production is likely to result from the inhibitory action of DRB on a cellular, rather than viral, function. Apparently some differences exist in the synthesis or processing of the mRNAs for interferons in primed and unprimed cells and these determine the different sensitivities of these two responses to DRB.;cysteine;-;-;LCR_without_function

11491285;The N-terminal domain of Homer/Vesl is a new class II EVH1 domain.;Cellular activities controlled by signal transduction processes such as cell motility and cell growth depend on the tightly regulated assembly of multiprotein complexes. Adapter proteins that specifically interact with their target proteins are key components required for the formation of these assemblies. Ena/VASP-homology 1 (EVH1) domains are small constituents of large modular proteins involved in microfilament assembly that specifically recognize proline-rich regions. EVH1 domain-containing proteins are present in neuronal cells, like the Homer/Vesl protein family that is involved in memory-generating processes. Here, we describe the crystal structure of the murine EVH1 domain of Vesl 2 at 2.2 A resolution. The small globular protein consists of a seven-stranded antiparallel beta-barrel with a C-terminal alpha-helix packing alongside the barrel. A shallow groove running parallel with beta-strand VI forms an extended peptide-binding site. Using peptide library screenings, we present data that demonstrate the high affinity of the Vesl 2 EVH1 domain towards peptide sequences containing a proline-rich core sequence (PPSPF) that requires additional charged amino acid residues on either side for specific binding. Our functional data, substantiated by structural data, demonstrate that the ligand-binding of the Vesl EVH1 domain differs from the interaction characteristics of the previously examined EVH1 domains of the Evl/Mena proteins. Analogous to the Src homology 3 (SH3) domains that bind their cognate ligands in two distinct directions, we therefore propose the existence of two distinct classes of EVH1 domains. ;proline;helix;-;LCR_with_function

In IS26-7D (n=41), IS started at d 26 ± 1 of lactation and sows were weaned 7d later. During IS, sows were separated from their piglets for 10h/day. Oestrus detection was performed twice daily without a boar and ovulation was confirmed by ultrasound once a week. In IS19-7D, IS19-14D and IS26-7D, respectively, 50%, 64% and 61% of the sows showed oestrus and ovulation during IS (P>0.05), and, of the remaining sows, 100%, 93%, and 69% showed oestrus in the first week after weaning. In CW sows, 95% showed oestrus in the first week after weaning. Parity 1 sows were considerably less likely than older parities (23% vs. 68%) to show oestrus in lactation. Pregnancy rate of the first post partum oestrus (during lactation or after weaning) was 89% (CW), 92% (IS19-7D), 80% (IS19-14D) and 77% (IS26-7D) (P>0.05) and subsequent litter size was 14.5 ± 0.5, 14.5 ± 0.6, 15.3 ± 0.5 and 15.2 ± 0.8, respectively (P>0.05). Sows mated during lactation had similar pregnancy rate and litter size to those mated after weaning. Hence, ongoing lactation for the first 2-9 d of pregnancy did not negatively affect fertility. A total of 50-64% of IS sows showed lactational oestrus, regardless of the stage of lactation. Pregnancy rates and litter size were similar to control sows, and were not affected by stage of lactation at mating.";-;-;-;hard_0
2532360;A gene required for transfer of T-DNA to plants encodes an ATPase with autophosphorylating activity.;The virB operon of the Agrobacterium tume-faciens pTiA6NC plasmid likely plays a role in directing T-DNA transfer events at the bacterial membrane, as determined previously by mutagenesis and cellular fractionation studies and by DNA sequence analysis of the approximately 12-kilobase-pair operon. The DNA sequence analysis also revealed consensus mononucleotide binding domains in the deduced virB5 and virB11 gene products, suggesting that one or both of these proteins couple energy, by means of nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) hydrolysis, to T-DNA transport. In this report, the product of virB11, an essential virulence gene, was overproduced in Escherichia coli and purified by using immunoaffinity chromatography. The immunoaffinity purified protein, as well as NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gel-eluted protein, bound and hydrolyzed ATP in the absence of DNA effectors. VirB11 protein also demonstrated in vitro autophosphorylation activity. VirB11 protein was localized primarily to the cytoplasmic membrane by immunoblot analysis of membrane fractions. The deduced VirB11 protein exhibits sequence similarity to comG ORF1, a protein required for uptake of DNA by competent Bacillus subtilis cells. These findings suggest that phosphorylation may serve to activate a component(s) of the A. tumefaciens T-DNA transport apparatus and may also represent a general activation mechanism of other bacterial DNA transport systems.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
1383404;Characterization of two antigenic sites recognized by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies directed against the fusion glycoprotein of human respiratory syncytial virus.;"Two antigenic sites recognized by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against the fusion (F) glycoprotein of human respiratory syncytial virus were mapped on the primary structure of the protein by (i) the identification of amino acid substitutions selected in antibody-escape mutants and (ii) the reactivity of synthetic peptides with MAbs. The first site contained several overlapping epitopes which were located within the trypsin-resistant amino-terminal third of the large F1 subunit. Only one of these epitopes was faithfully reproduced by a short synthetic peptide; the others might require specific local conformations to react with MAbs. The second antigenic site was located in a trypsin-sensitive domain of the F1 subunit towards the carboxy-terminal end of the cysteine-rich region. One of these epitopes was reproduced by synthetic peptides. In addition, mutagenized F protein with a substitution of serine for arginine at position 429 did not bind MAbs to the second site. These results are discussed in terms of F protein structure and the mechanisms of virus neutralization.";cysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
528048;Crossed immunoelectrophoretic analysis of two antigen extracts of Thermoactinomyces candidus.;A pyridine extract antigen and a double-dialysis antigen (DDA) obtained from Thermoactinomyces candidus were analyzed by crossed immunoelectrophoresis. In addition, the heat lability, pronase sensitivity, and isolectric points of the components of the DDA were determined. By using antisera raised against crude pyridine extract antigen, two immunogenic components were resolved by crossed immunoelectrophoresis. A similar analysis of DDA using antisera raised against crude DDA revealed 15 immunogens. All but six components were heat labile, whereas pronase had little effect on the number of resolvable components. Intermediate gel crossed immunoelectrophoresis using antiserum raised to whole spores detected six immunogenic components, four of which were also detected by the anti-DDA serum. A total of 19 bands were obtained when the DDA was subjected to flatbed isoelectric focusing on polyacrylamide gels. The isoelectric points for the various components were found to range from 3.5 to 5.7. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis using isoelectric focusing in the first dimension yielded at least 16 immunogenic components. Six components with isoelectric points falling in the range of 4.5 to 6.4 were found to be resistant to heat. A comparison with antigens obtained from other thermophilic actinomycetes is presented.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
2193058;Anti-actin antibodies: a new test for an old problem.;Smooth muscle antibodies with anti-actin specificity are commonly regarded as markers of autoimmune liver disease. However, there are interpretational problems because different techniques have been used for their identification and therefore the results are difficult to compare. The present paper reports the results of a new method for the identification of anti-actin antibodies (indirect immunofluorescence on cryostat sections of liver from rats chronically injected with phalloidin). The results have been compared with those obtained by four other techniques: demonstration by immunofluorescence of kidney peritubular reactivity (SMAT), of anti-microfilament antibodies (on HEp-2 cells and vinblastine-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells) and counterimmunoelectrophoresis with purified muscle actin as antigen. The new method proved to be the most sensitive and specific. Furthermore, its reproducibility was found to be high, the interpretation easy and the cost low. The clinical significance of anti-actin antibodies in patients with chronic liver disease is also discussed.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
12509992;Inhibition of tobacco etch virus protease activity by detergents.;Affinity tags such as polyhistidine greatly facilitate recombinant protein production. The solubility of integral membrane proteins is maintained by the formation of protein-detergent complexes (PDCs), with detergent present at concentration above its critical micelle concentration (CMC). Removal of the affinity tag necessitates inclusion of an engineered protease cleavage site. A commonly utilized protease for tag removal is tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease. TEV is available in a recombinant form (rTEV) and frequently contains its own polyhistidine affinity tag for removal after use in enzymatic digestion. Proteolytic cleavage of the tagged domain is carried out by incubation of the protein with rTEV protease. We have observed that the efficiency of rTEV digestion decreases significantly in the presence of a variety of detergents utilized in purification, crystallization, and other biochemical studies of integral membrane proteins. This reduction in protease activity is suggestive of detergent-induced inhibition of rTEV. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of detergents upon the rTEV proteolytic digestion of a soluble fusion protein, alpha(1) platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAFAHalpha(1)). Removal of a hexahistidine amino-terminal affinity tag has been characterized in the presence of 16 different detergents at concentrations above their respective CMCs. Our data indicate that half of the detergents tested reduce the activity of rTEV and that these detergents should be avoided or otherwise accounted for during rTEV digestion of recombinant integral membrane proteins.;histidine;-;-;LCR_without_function
2440807;Phenotypic variation in epitope expression of the Neisseria gonorrhoeae lipooligosaccharide.;Gonococcal lipooligosaccharides (LOSs) are a series of antigenically complex heteropolymers. To investigate whether all members of clonally selected populations of Neisseria gonorrhoeae express antigenically similar LOS, we studied gonococcal strains 4505 and 220 with monoclonal antibodies 6B4 and 3F11 which have specificity for different oligosaccharide epitopes on the same or comigrating LOS unit(s) on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fluorescent-antibody and immunoelectron microscopy studies indicated that all members of the clonally selected populations were not homogenous for the epitopes these antibodies recognized. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting studies of 3F11-coated strain 220 indicated that the density of epitope expression was a function of time of growth. The population could be separated into two broad groups corresponding to organisms staining strongly or weakly for the 3F11 epitope, and the epitope density decreased during the late-log and stationary phases of growth. Sequentially staining organisms on Formvar grids with 6B4 and 3F11, followed by staining with either 5- or 15-nm colloidal gold spheres conjugated to goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin M demonstrated the following populations of cells among organisms derived from a single clone: organisms which stained for both 6B4 and 3F11 epitopes and organisms which stained for either 6B4 epitopes alone or 3F11 epitopes alone. Immunofluorescence microscopy studies with rhodamine and fluorescein goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin M conjugates sequentially staining organisms on Formvar grids with 3F11 and 6B4 also demonstrated these three populations. Analysis of LOS preparations made over the last 5 years indicated no change in serotype antigen concentration or in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis migration pattern. These studies indicate that while clonally selected strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae undergo phenotypic variation at the epitope level, the impact of this variation on the total LOS of the population has little overall effect on its antigenic or physicochemical properties.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
8182078;Binding of urinary protein C inhibitor to cultured human epithelial kidney tumor cells (TCL-598). The role of glycosaminoglycans present on the luminal cell surface.;Binding of urinary protein C inhibitor (PCI) to cultured human epithelial kidney tumor cells (TCL-598) was studied. Binding was dose-dependent, time-dependent, and saturable. Heparin interfered in a dose-dependent way with PCI binding to TCL-598 as did heparan sulfate and to a lesser degree also dermatan sulfate. Pretreatment of TCL-598 with protamine sulfate inhibited subsequent binding of PCI in a dose-dependent manner and > 100 micrograms/ml protamine sulfate reduced binding of PCI to < 10% of the control. Binding of 125I-PCI was specific, and bound 125I-PCI was recovered from the cells by heparin treatment or detached together with intact cells by EDTA treatment, migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with the same mobility (M(r) = 57,000) as unbound 125I-PCI. Furthermore, cell-bound PCI was functionally active as judged from its ability to inhibit the amidolytic activity of urokinase, and its inhibitory activity was stimulated approximately 3-4-fold as compared to fluid-phase PCI. Immunogold electron microscopy revealed that PCI-antigen presented to the cells from the luminal side bound exclusively to that surface in native as well as in prefixed cells. This binding of PCI was abolished in the presence of heparin (50 micrograms/ml) and after pretreatment of the cells either with protamine sulfate (400 micrograms/ml) or with heparinase III (0.5 unit/ml). A slight decrease in PCI binding was seen after pretreatment of the cells with chondroitinase ABC and chondroitinase AC. In contrast, binding of PCI to extracellular matrices of TCL-598 was decreased to approximately 70% after chondroitinase ABC treatment of the extracellular matrices, whereas both heparinase III or chondroitinase AC treatment only reduced matrix-bound PCI to approximately 95%. These data suggest that heparan sulfate-containing proteoglycans are predominantly involved in binding of PCI to the luminal side of TCL-598, while dermatan sulfate-containing proteoglycans, the overall predominant PCI-binding proteoglycans in TCL extracts, are responsible for PCI binding to the extracellular matrix. Heparan sulfate, however, exposed to an environment containing PCI under physiological conditions, might localize PCI and modulate its target enzyme specificity in vivo.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
4128443;Dual regulatory role of the thymus in the maturation of immune response in the rabbit.;Rabbits thymectomized in early adulthood produced more antihapten antibody than sham-thymectomized controls after hyperimmunization with 2,4-dinitrophenyl bovine gamma globulin (DNP-BGG). The average associated constant of anti-DNP antibody produced by thymectomized animals was more than 10 times higher than that of the controls. Similar effects were obtained by extensive treatment of rabbits with antithymocyte serum (ATS) before and during the immunization with DNP-BGG. The results indicated that relative diminution of thymus-derived lymphocytes (T cells) resulted in a stimulation of antibody-forming cells with a higher affinity. On the other hand, preimmunization of rabbits with different doses of BGG caused either enhancement or suppression of the hapten-specific antibody response, depending on the priming dose of BGG. The suppressed antibody response was always associated with a marked decrease in the antibody affinity. If rabbits were partially tolerized with a large dose of soluble BGG, some of the animals produced little antibody against hapten (DNP) coupled to this carrier, and the affinity of produced antibody was low. However, other rabbits tolerized with BGG produced large amounts of anti-DNP antibody upon hyperimmunization with DNP-BGG, whose affinity was only slightly lower than that of the control. These results can be harmonized if it is assumed that the thymus plays an important role in the maturation of the immune response. It is postulated that T cells, in numbers ordinarily available, would first assist in the proliferation of antihapten antibody-forming cell precursors already selected by antigen, thus accounting for the rapid increase of antibody affinity in the early stage of immunization. However, after a larger number of carrier-specific T cells are made in response to continued immunization, these would suppress antibody-forming cells. The suppression would be greater for cells with higher affinity for antigen, resulting in a decrease in antibody affinity. This postulate explains preferential stimulation and suppression of cells having higher affinity receptors under circumstances in which T cell are relatively depleted or overstimulated, and further permits an explanation for the decrease of antibody affinity after long-term immunization.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
310424;Cellular changes in lungs of mice infected with influenza virus: characterization of the cytotoxic responses.;"Transpleural lavage of lungs from uninfected C3H mice yielded an average of 300,000 leukocytes per mouse. This number increased eightfold within 6 days after intranasal inoculation with virulent influenza A/Hong Kong/68 (H3N2) virus. Macrophages and lymphocytes in approximately equal numbers comprised 90% or more of the leukocytes both before and during infection. B, T, and null lymphocytes comprised, respectively, 9, 21, and 18% of the leukocytes before infection and 7, 26, and 5% by day 6. In absolute numbers, macrophages and T lymphocytes provided the major increments during infection. Cytotoxic activity of mononuclear cells from lung lavages was compared in a chromium release assay using syngeneic L929 target cells with the activity of mediastinal lymph nodes, spleens, and peripheral blood of uninfected and infected C3H mice. Nonspecific cytotoxicity for target cells infected with H3hkNeq1 or B/Lee influenza virus was found with mononuclear cells from uninfected mice. This activity tended to be highest with lavage leukocytes and was associated with adherent cells, presumably macrophages. Increased virus-specific cytotoxicity was detected with lavage cells by day 6 and persisted through day 9, the period of maximal pneumonia. Similar cytotoxic activity also appeared in cells from the nodes and spleen at this same time but was not detected in peripheral blood cells. The virus-specific cytotoxicity of lavage cells was due largely to a nonadherent cell possessing Fc receptors and theta antigen but lacking C3 receptors; these properties are compatible with actively cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The cytological characteristics of the infiltrating leukocytes and the cytotoxicity data suggest that the local T cell response to influenza virus infection in the lung is a major contributor to the pneumonia observed in this mouse model.";-;antigen;-;hard_2
12874333;DNA immunization with the cysteine-rich interdomain region 1 of the Plasmodium falciparum variant antigen elicits limited cross-reactive antibody responses.;"The variant surface antigens of Plasmodium falciparum are an important component of naturally acquired immunity and an important vaccine target. However, these proteins appear to elicit primarily variant-specific antibodies. We tested if naked DNA immunization can elicit more cross-reactive antibody responses and allow simultaneous immunization with several variant constructs. Mice immunized with plasmid DNA expressing variant cysteine-rich interdomain region 1 (CIDR1) domains of the P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) developed antibodies that were reactive to the corresponding PfEMP1s as measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, flow cytometry, and agglutination of parasitized erythrocytes (PEs). We observed some cross-reactive immune responses; for example, sera from mice immunized with one domain agglutinated PEs of various lines and recognized heterologous domains expressed on the surface of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. We found no significant antigenic competition when animals were immunized with a mixture of plasmids or immunized sequentially with individual constructs. Moreover, mixed or sequential immunizations resulted in greater cross-reactive agglutination responses than immunization with a single domain. Recombinant protein (Sc y179) immunization after priming with DNA (prime-boost regimen) increased antibody titers to the homologous domain substantially but seemed to diminish the cross-reactive responses somewhat. The titer of agglutinating antibodies was previously shown to correlate with protection. Surprisingly, the agglutination titers of sera from DNA immunization were high, similar to those of pooled human hyperimmune sera. These sera also appeared to give limited low-titer variant transcending agglutination. Thus, DNA immunization appears to be a very useful tool for developing variant antigen vaccines.

22553207;Dual function of the UNC-45b chaperone with myosin and GATA4 in cardiac development.;Cardiac development requires interplay between the regulation of gene expression and the assembly of functional sarcomeric proteins. We report that UNC-45b recessive loss-of-function mutations in C3H and C57BL/6 inbred mouse strains cause arrest of cardiac morphogenesis at the formation of right heart structures and failure of contractile function. Wild-type C3H and C57BL/6 embryos at the same stage, E9.5, form actively contracting right and left atria and ventricles. The known interactions of UNC-45b as a molecular chaperone are consistent with diminished accumulation of the sarcomeric myosins, but not their mRNAs, and the resulting decreased contraction of homozygous mutant embryonic hearts. The novel finding that GATA4 accumulation is similarly decreased at the protein but not mRNA levels is also consistent with the function of UNC-45b as a chaperone. The mRNAs of known downstream targets of GATA4 during secondary cardiac field development, the cardiogenic factors Hand1, Hand2 and Nkx-2.5, are also decreased, consistent with the reduced GATA4 protein accumulation. Direct binding studies show that the UNC-45b chaperone forms physical complexes with both the alpha and beta cardiac myosins and the cardiogenic transcription factor GATA4. Co-expression of UNC-45b with GATA4 led to enhanced transcription from GATA promoters in naïve cells. These novel results suggest that the heart-specific UNC-45b isoform functions as a molecular chaperone mediating contractile function of the sarcomere and gene expression in cardiac development.;-;transcription factor;-;hard_2

16043695;HIV-1 Nef down-regulates the hemochromatosis protein HFE, manipulating cellular iron homeostasis.;"The multifunctional Nef protein of HIV-1 is important for the progression to AIDS. One action of Nef is to down-regulate surface MHC I molecules, helping infected cells to evade immunity. We found that Nef also down-regulates the macrophage-expressed MHC 1b protein HFE, which regulates iron homeostasis and is mutated in the iron-overloading disorder hemochromatosis. In model cell lines, Nef reroutes HFE to a perinuclear structure that overlaps the trans-Golgi network, causing a 90% reduction of surface HFE. This activity requires a Src-kinase-binding proline-rich domain of Nef and a conserved tyrosine-based motif in the cytoplasmic tail of HFE. HIV-1 infection of ex vivo macrophages similarly down-regulates naturally expressed surface HFE in a Nef-dependent manner. The effect of Nef expression on cellular iron was explored; iron and ferritin accumulation were increased in HIV-1-infected ex vivo macrophages expressing wild-type HFE, but this effect was lost with Nef-deleted HIV-1 or when infecting macrophages from hemochromatosis patients expressing mutated HFE. The iron accumulation in HIV-1-infected HFE-expressing macrophages was paralleled by an increase in cellular HIV-1-gag expression. We conclude that, through Nef and HFE, HIV-1 directly regulates cellular iron metabolism, possibly benefiting viral growth.";proline;-;-;LCR_without_function
1283142;Analysis of the gene encoding a 16-kDa proteolipid subunit of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase from Manduca sexta midgut and tubules.;Vacuolar ATPases (V-ATPases), originally characterised as components of endomembranes, have also been implicated in epithelial ion transport, both in vertebrates and in insects. The ATPase is particularly noteworthy in lepidopteran larvae, where it generates large transepithelial potential differences and short-circuit currents across the midgut epithelium. A cDNA library from Manduca sexta larval midguts and Malpighian tubules was screened with a Drosophila melanogaster cDNA encoding the 16-kDa proteolipid subunit of the V-ATPase, and a 1.4-kb cDNA sequenced in its entirety. The sequence contains a long open reading frame, encoding a putative peptide of 156 amino acids (aa) and with an M(r) of 15,967, in close agreement with values previously suggested by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels of M. sexta midgut proteins. Correspondence of the deduced aa sequence with those of other species, particularly D. melanogaster, was extremely close. Northern blots of M. sexta midgut mRNA at high stringency revealed two transcripts of 1.4 and 1.9 kb, whereas genomic Southern blots suggest that there is only a single copy of the gene in M. sexta.

9786944;Determination of the functional domain organization of the importin alpha nuclear import factor.;Although importin alpha (Imp alpha) has been shown to act as the receptor for basic nuclear localization signals (NLSs) and to mediate their recruitment to the importin beta nuclear import factor, little is known about the functional domains present in Imp alpha, with the exception that importin beta binding is known to map close to the Imp alpha NH2 terminus. Here, we demonstrate that sequences essential for binding to the CAS nuclear export factor are located near the Imp alpha COOH terminus and include a critical acidic motif. Although point mutations introduced into this acidic motif inactivated both CAS binding and Imp alpha nuclear export, a putative leucine-rich nuclear export signal proved to be neither necessary nor sufficient for Imp alpha nuclear export. Analysis of sequences within Imp alpha that bind to the SV-40 T antigen NLS or to the similar LEF-1 NLS revealed that both NLSs interact with a subset of the eight degenerate armadillo (Arm) repeats that form the central part of Imp alpha. However, these two NLS-binding sites showed only minimal overlap, thus suggesting that the degeneracy of the Arm repeat region of Imp alpha may serve to facilitate binding to similar but nonidentical basic NLSs. Importantly, the SV-40 T NLS proved able to specifically inhibit the interaction of Imp alpha with CAS in vitro, thus explaining why the SV-40 T NLS is unable to also function as a nuclear export signal. ;leucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
25125500;Preparation and antitumor effect of a toxin-linked conjugate targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and urokinase plasminogen activator.;"The aberrant signaling activation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) is a common characteristic of many tumors, including lung cancer. Accordingly, VEGFR and uPA have emerged as attractive targets for tumor. KDR (Flk-1/VEGFR-2), a member of the VEGFR family, has been recognized as an important target for antiangiogenesis in tumor. In this study, a recombinant immunotoxin was produced to specifically target KDR-expressing tumor vascular endothelial cells and uPA-expressing tumor cells and mediate antitumor angiogenesis and antitumor effect. Based on its potent inhibitory effect on protein synthesis, Luffin-beta (Lβ) ribosome-inactivating protein was selected as part of a recombinant fusion protein, a single-chain variable fragment against KDR (KDRscFv)-uPA cleavage site (uPAcs)-Lβ-KDEL (named as KPLK). The KDRscFv-uPAcs-Lβ-KDEL (KPLK) contained a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) against KDR, uPAcs, Lβ, and the retention signal for endoplasmic reticulum proteins KDEL (Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu). The KPLK-expressing vector was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the KPLK protein was isolated with nickel affinity chromatography and gel filtration chromatography. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis test demonstrated KPLK was effectively expressed. Result of in vitro cell viability assay on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) H460 cell line (uPA-positive cell) revealed that KPLK significantly inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and accumulated cells in S and G2/M phases, but the normal cell line (human submandibular gland cell) was unaffected. These effects were enhanced when uPA was added to digest KPLK to release Lβ. For in vivo assay of KPLK, subcutaneous xenograft tumor model of nude mice were established with H460 cells. Growth of solid tumors was significantly inhibited in animals treated with KPLK up to 21 days, tumor weights were decreased, and the expression of angiogenesis marker CD31 was downregulated; meanwhile, the apoptosis-related protein casspase-3 was upregulated. These results suggested that the recombinant KPLK may have therapeutic applications on tumors, especially uPA-overexpressing ones.";-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1

Aqueous humor proteins were analyzed by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and detected by the ultrasensitive silver staining technique. In 79% of the samples taken from POAG patients, protein bands of 140,000 or 160,000 daltons were stained, but none were stained from cataract patients. The presence of these protein bands revealed statistically significant differences between the two groups. Protein bands of 140,000 or 160,000 daltons were evenly visible at all ages in POAG patients, and the positivity of bands had no correlation with sex or initial intraocular pressure level. It is possible that the ultrastructural changes of the aqueous outflow pathway in POAG may be related to the changes in the aqueous protein, presence of 140,000 or 160,000 daltons protein bands.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
2462454;Effect of synthetic human parathyroid hormone on the levels of alkaline phosphatase activity and formation of alkaline phosphatase-rich matrix vesicles by primary cultures of chicken epiphyseal growth plate chondrocytes.;The effect of synthetic human parathyroid hormone (hPTH) on the formation of matrix vesicles (MV), and on the rate of cell division, production of cellular alkaline phosphatase (AP) and protein by primary cultures of chicken epiphyseal growth plate hypertrophic chondrocytes was investigated. Addition to serum-containing or serum-free media of physiological levels of hPTH, in a range from 0.1 to 10 nM, caused a progressive decrease in the formation of AP-rich MV. However, studies on incorporation of [3H]choline into MV indicate that MV formation per se was not significantly decreased. hPTH was found to markedly decrease the expression of cellular AP, accompanied by an increase in cell division [( 3H]thymidine incorporation) and protein synthesis. Since these effects of hPTH were augmented by 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, and mimicked by the cAMP analogue N6,O2'-dibutyryl-adenosine 3',5'-cyclic-monophosphate (DBcAMP), the findings clearly indicate that hPTH was acting through the classic cAMP-mediated mechanism. Inasmuch as elevation of AP in growth plate chondrocytes coincides with MV formation, maturation and hypertrophy of the cells, and induction of mineralization, the stimulation of cell division and suppression of cellular AP indicates that hPTH would cause the cells to revert to a less differentiated state. Thus, elevation in PTH, which results from lowered circulating levels of Ca2+, should inhibit mineral deposition in the growth plate. This may be a physiological protective mechanism to prevent a further drain on serum Ca2+.;proline;phosphatase activity;-;LCR_with_function

Magnetic means of applying forces, particularly those based on permanent magnets and magnetic beads coupled to substrates or cells provide an accessible means of exerting forces of appropriate magnitude. The amount of force exerted, however, is often inferred from calibration performed ex situ, with typically similar but different magnetic beads. Here, we construct a simple magnetic tweezer by coupling a pencil-shaped stainless-steel probe to permanent neodymium magnets using a 3D printed adapter. We then demonstrate the in situ determination of magnetic bead pulling forces on a super-paramagnetic micro-bead coupled to a soft substrate using traction force microscopy. We determine the force exerted on the magnetic bead by the magnet probe - and thus exerted by the magnetic bead on the soft polyacrylamide substrate - as a function of the distance between the probe tip and the magnetic bead. We also show that we can determine the force exerted on a magnetic bead coupled to a cell by the changes in the traction force exerted by the cell on the soft substrate beneath. We thus demonstrate that forces of nanonewton magnitude can be locally exerted on soft substrates or cells and simultaneously determined using traction force microscopy. Application of this method for the in situ measurement of localized exogenous forces exerted on cells can also enable dissection of cellular force transmission pathways.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
17678615;LaTBP1: a Leishmania amazonensis DNA-binding protein that associates in vivo with telomeres and GT-rich DNA using a Myb-like domain.;Different species of Leishmania can cause a variety of medically important diseases, whose control and treatment are still health problems. Telomere binding proteins (TBPs) have potential as targets for anti-parasitic chemotherapy because of their importance for genome stability and cell viability. Here, we describe LaTBP1 a protein that has a Myb-like DNA-binding domain, a feature shared by most double-stranded telomeric proteins. Binding assays using full-length and truncated LaTBP1 combined with spectroscopy analysis were used to map the boundaries of the Myb-like domain near to the protein only tryptophan residue. The Myb-like domain of LaTBP1 contains a conserved hydrophobic cavity implicated in DNA-binding activity. A hypothetical model helped to visualize that it shares structural homology with domains of other Myb-containing proteins. Competition assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed the specificity of LaTBP1 for telomeric and GT-rich DNAs, suggesting that LaTBP1 is a new TBP. ;threonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
6731676;Experimental disseminated strongyloidiasis in Erythrocebus patas. II. Immunology.;Parasite-specific humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated in seven Erythrocebus patas monkeys experimentally infected with a Southeast Asian strain of Strongyloides stercoralis. Most animals developed high titers of anti-larval surface IgG antibody (as evaluated by the indirect immunofluorescence test), and all animals tested developed specific IgE antibody (as shown by the in vitro histamine release test). Modest lymphoproliferative responses to S. stercoralis antigens were demonstrated in most animals during the early phase of the infection (days 20-40), but disappeared later. Steroid treatment (prednisone, 12.5 mg/kg on alternate days) was given to three animals, but did not appear to significantly affect the immune parameters tested. The degree of the immune responses to S. stercoralis larval antigens did not correlate well with the course of the infection, and several animals died of disseminated disease in spite of demonstrable humoral and cellular responses to these antigens. We suggest therefore that other factors, such as local intestinal immune and nonimmune mechanisms may be of importance in protection against disseminated strongyloidiasis.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
10999600;Characterization of the biochemical properties of the human Upf1 gene product that is involved in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.;The Upf1 protein in yeast has been implicated in the modulation of efficient translation termination as well as in the accelerated turnover of mRNAs containing premature stop codons, a phenomenon called nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). A human homolog of the yeast UPF1, termed HUpf1/RENT1, has also been identified. The HUpf1 has also been shown to play a role in NMD in mammalian cells. Comparison of the yeast and human UPF1 proteins demonstrated that the amino terminal cysteine/histidine-rich region and the region comprising the domains that define this protein as a superfamily group I helicase have been conserved. The yeast Upf1p demonstrates RNA-dependent ATPase and 5' --> 3' helicase activities. In this paper, we report the expression, purification, and characterization of the activities of the human Upf1 protein. We demonstrate that human Upf1 protein displays a nucleic-acid-dependent ATPase activity and a 5'--> 3' helicase activity. Furthermore, human Upf1 is an RNA-binding protein whose RNA-binding activity is modulated by ATP. Taken together, these results indicate that the activities of the Upf1 protein are conserved across species, reflecting the conservation of function of this protein throughout evolution. ;histidine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
4318;An extracellular aminopeptidase from Clostridium histolyticum.;An aminopeptidase was isolated from the culture filtrate of Clostridium histolyticum and purified to homogeneity. Absence of endopeptidase activity in the purified preparation was demonstrated. Gel filtration on a calibrated column indicates an apparent molecular weight of 340000 for the native enzyme. Gel electrophoresis of the denatured enzyme in the presence of dodecylsulfate in constant acrylamide concentration and in a concentration gradient, resulted in the appearance of a single component for which a molecular weight of 51000 and 59000 respectively, was calculated. From mobilities of crosslinked and denatured protein species a molecular weight of 56000 was obtained for the monomer. Specificity studies show that the enzyme cleaves all types of N-terminel amino acid residues including proline and hydroxyproline from small peptides and from polypeptides. The peptide bond formed between an N-terminal amino acid residue and proline is not cleaved by the enzyme. The combined action of aminopeptidase-P and clostridal aminopeptidase leads to complete hydrolysis of the proline-rich nonapeptide bradykinin. Low rates of hydrolysis was observed for charged residues, and amides of amino acids. Kinetic studies with five tripeptides of the general structure X-Gly-Gly, where X stands for Leu, Phe, Val, Ala, or Pro, show a decrease in Km with the increasing size of the hydrophobic side chain of X. The highest Kcat values are observed with proline and alanine. In the series Pro-Gly, Pro-Gly-Pro, Pro-Gly-Pro-Pro, the last peptide is the best substrate, indicating an active site complementary to at least four amino acid residues. The enzymatic activity is dependent on the presence of divalent cations, maximal activation being reached with Mn2+ and Co2+. The optimal pH for the Mn2+ and Co2+- activated enzyme is 8.6 and 8.2 respectively. The optimal temperature is 40 degrees C. Inhibition of the aminopeptidase was achieved with Zn2+, Cu2+ and p-mercuribenzoate, but not with diisopropylphosphofluoridate.;proline;-;-;LCR_without_function
29346283;The Biological Role of Hyaluronan-Rich Oocyte-Cumulus Extracellular Matrix in Female Reproduction.;"Fertilization of the mammalian oocyte requires interactions between spermatozoa and expanded cumulus extracellular matrix (ECM) that surrounds the oocyte. This review focuses on key molecules that play an important role in the formation of the cumulus ECM, generated by the oocyte-cumulus complex. In particular, the specific inhibitors (AG1478, lapatinib, indomethacin and MG132) and progesterone receptor antagonist (RU486) exerting their effects through the remodeling of the ECM of the cumulus cells surrounding the oocyte have been described. After gonadotropin stimulus, cumulus cells expand and form hyaluronan (HA)-rich cumulus ECM. In pigs, the proper structure of the cumulus ECM depends on the interaction between HA and serum-derived proteins of the inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor (IαI) protein family. We have demonstrated the synthesis of HA by cumulus cells, and the presence of the IαI, tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced protein 6 and pentraxin 3 in expanding oocyte-cumulus complexes (OCC). We have evaluated the covalent linkage of heavy chains of IαI proteins to HA, as the principal component of the expanded HA-rich cumulus ECM, in porcine OCC cultured in medium with specific inhibitors: AG1478 and lapatinib (both inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase activity); MG132 (a specific proteasomal inhibitor), indomethacin (cyclooxygenase inhibitor); and progesterone receptor antagonist (RU486). We have found that both RU486 and indomethacin does not disrupt the formation of the covalent linkage between the heavy chains of IαI to HA in the expanded OCC. In contrast, the inhibitors AG1478 and lapatinib prevent gonadotropin-induced cumulus expansion. Finally, the formation of oocyte-cumulus ECM relying on the covalent transfer of heavy chains of IαI molecules to HA has been inhibited in the presence of MG132. ";-;kinase activity;-;hard_2

In this study, the recoveries of the six herbicides based on ultrasound-assisted and QuEChERS extraction methods were compared, and five adsorbent materials (C18, PSA, GCB, Florisil, and EMR) were optimized based on their purification and adsorption capacities. The results showed that the ultrasound-assisted extractions gave recoveries greater than 90% for the six compounds. Furthermore, EMR showed little adsorption for the six compounds and a reduced matrix effect by effective removal of the oil lipids. The six herbicide residues had good linearities in the concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 500.0 μg/L, and the correlation coefficients were greater than 0.9984. The limits of detection and limits of quantification for this method were 0.08-0.8 μg/kg and 0.25-2.5 μg/kg, respectively. The recoveries of the six pesticides at three spiked levels in four matrices (rapeseed, soybean, peanut, and sunflower seed) ranged from 70.7% to 103.8%, with relative standard deviations of 0.8%-9.2%.

28011985;BeEAM conditioning with bendamustine-replacing BCNU before autologous transplantation is safe and effective in lymphoma patients.;BEAM with BCNU is commonly used for conditioning treatment followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). However, pulmonary toxicity and availability issues associated with BCNU prompted us to evaluate bendamustine-replacing BCNU (BeEAM). We analyzed 39 lymphoma patients receiving BeEAM conditioning with 200 mg/m2 bendamustine at days -7 and -6. The median duration until neutrophil recovery was 11 days, and 15 days for platelet recovery (>20 g/L). The most common grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicities comprised mucosal side effects (27 pts.). Pulmonary toxicity was observed in one patient (2.5%), and one patient died of septic complications. The CR rate increased from 33% to 74% 100 days after ASCT. After a median follow-up of 18.5 months, progression and death each occurred in 11 patients (28%). Median progression-free and overall survival at 2 years were 69% and 72%.

1350721;Evolution of the vertebrate Hox homeobox genes.;One of the most remarkable recent findings in developmental biology has been the colinear and homologous relationships shared between the Drosophila HOM-C and vertebrate Hox homeobox gene complexes. These relationships pose the question of the functional significance of colinearity and its molecular basis. While there was much initial resistance to the validity of this comparison, it now appears the Hox/HOM homology reflects a broad degree of evolutionary conservation which has reawakened interest in comparative embryology and evolution. The evolutionary conservation of protein motifs in many gene families (including those for growth factors, secreted and membrane bound signalling factors, adhesion molecules, cytoplasmic receptor kinases, nuclear receptors and transcription factors) has lead to speculation on the extent to which these homology relationships represent common developmental processes and underlying molecular mechanisms. Structural identifies in a protein may indicate the biochemical/molecular function that a protein plays in cellular and developmental processes, without reflecting a conserved role in a cascade of developmental events. However, the analysis of genes encoding transcription factors has provided evidence suggesting that there are gene complexes in arthropods and vertebrates which are true homologues and which may share common roles in the specification of regional identity along embryonic A-P axis. These genes comprise the Hox/HOM-C homeotic complexes. This review will detail some of the evidence for this proposed relationship and will speculate on the functional implications.;-;transcription factor;-;hard_2
18060457;An intronic sequence mutated in flexed-tail mice regulates splicing of Smad5.;Recent work has identified a growing body of evidence that subtle changes in noncoding sequences can result in significant pathology. These mutations, which would have been called silent polymorphisms in the past, affect gene transcription and mRNA splicing and lead to drastic changes in gene expression. Previous work from our lab has characterized the murine flexed-tail (f) mutation, which encodes Smad5, a transcription factor that functions downstream of the receptors for bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). f/f mice are unable to rapidly respond to acute anemia. Our analysis of these mice led to the development of a new model for stress erythropoiesis, where BMP4 expression in the spleen leads to the Smad5-dependent expansion of a specialized population of stress erythroid progenitors during the recovery from acute anemia. f/f mutant mice exhibit a defect in Smad5 mRNA splicing in the spleen such that the majority of Smad5 transcripts are two misspliced mRNAs. One of these mRNAs encodes a truncated form of Smad5 that inhibits BMP4 signaling when overexpressed. Here we show that a mutation in a poly(T) element in intron 4 causes the splicing defect in f/f mutant mice. This subtle mutation (loss of 1 or 2 Ts in a 16-T element) results in defects in splicing throughout the Smad5 gene. Furthermore, we show that this mutation results in tissue-specific splicing defects, which may explain why f/f mice are viable when Smad5-/- mice are embryonic lethal. ;threonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
24173589;The spalt-related gene of Drosophila melanogaster is a member of an ancient gene family, defined by the adjacent, region-specific homeotic gene spalt.;"We report the full coding sequence of a new Drosophila gene, spalt-related, which is homologous and adjacent to the region-specific homeotic gene, spalt. Both genes have three widely spaced sets of C2H2 zinc finger motifs, but spalt-related encodes a fourth pair of C-terminal fingers resembling the Xenopus homologue, Xsal-1. The degrees of sequence divergence among all three members of this family are comparable, suggesting that the Drosophila genes originated from an ancient gene duplication. The spalt-related gene is expressed with quantitative variations from mid-embryogenesis (8-12 h) to the adult stage, but not in ovaries or early embryos. Expression is localized to limited parts of the body, including specific cell populations in the nervous system. In the wing disc, spalt and spalt-related are expressed in indistinguishable domains; in the nervous system and some other organs the expression patterns extensively overlap but are not identical, indicating that the genes have partially diverged in terms of developmental regulation. A characteristic central set of zinc fingers specifically binds to an A/T-rich consensus sequence, defining some DNA binding properties of this ancient family of nuclear factors.

8663246;Activation of phospholipase D and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase in HL60 membranes is mediated by endogenous Arf but not Rho.;"Membrane-associated phospholipase D (PLD) in HL60 cells can be activated by the small GTP-binding proteins Arf and RhoA, but polyphosphorylated inositol lipids were required for maximum activity. The intact lipid was required because neither inositol 1,4, 5-trisphosphate nor stearoyl-arachidonyl glycerol could substitute for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Arf-stimulated but not Rho-stimulated PLD activity was increased by the inclusion of Mg2+ and ATP. ATP-dependent PLD activation occurred when phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP), PIP2, or phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) were included, but PIP2 formation was only detected with PIP; no PIP3 production was detected under any conditions. Therefore, the ATP-dependent increase in PLD activity cannot be explained by PIP2 or PIP3 formation. Association of endogenous Arf and RhoA with membranes was increased by incubation with GTPgammaS. This treatment increased membrane PLD and PIP kinase activities in the absence of exogenous p21 proteins. Reduction of Arf translocation suppressed the increase in PLD and PIP kinase activities, whereas complete removal of Rho but not Arf from membranes with RhoGDI was without effect on PLD activity but increased PIP kinase activity. Therefore, although recombinant Arf and Rho can activate PLD and PIP kinase in HL60 cells, it is the endogenous Arf but not Rho that regulates PLD, and thus a role for Rho in the physiological regulation of PLD in HL60 cells is unlikely.";-;kinase activity;-;hard_2
9388346;[The comparison of tepid and moderate hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass in cardiac surgery].;Normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is being increasingly used at some institutions. Patients undergoing normothermic CPB have a higher systemic oxygen demand and may be at higher risk for ischemic injury. This study was designed to confirm the clinical efficacy and safety of tepid hypothermic CPB. Thirty-six patients undergoing open heart surgery between June 1993 and August 1994 were divided into two groups: tepid (n = 18, 32 degrees C) and moderate (n = 18, 26 degrees C) hypothermic CPB. There were no significant differences in preoperative and perioperative patients characteristics between the two groups. The mean aortic cross-clamp time did not differ between two groups, but the mean CPB time was significantly shorter in tepid hypothermic patients. Serum lactate after CPB and lactate/pyrvate ratio during CPB in tepid hypothermic patients were significantly lower than in moderate hypothermic patients. The mixed venous oxygen saturation in tepid hypothermic patients was significantly lower however, it was maintained at levels more than 70% during CPB. This study suggests that tepid hypothermic CPB is a safe and effective alternative to moderate hypothermic CPB for patients undergoing open heart surgery. Previous reports have documented that patients undergoing normothermic CPB are at greater risk for cerebral desaturation. We should evaluate cerebral venous oxygen saturation during tepid hypothermic CPB before the induction of normothermic CPB.;-;-;-;hard_0
305263;Glycoproteins and antigens of membranes prepared from rat thymocytes after lysis by shearing or with the detergent Tween-40.;In purification of cell surface antigens an efficient method for preparing membrane from large numbers of cells is needed. Such a method is described for preparing membranes from rat thymocytes after lysis in the non-ionic detergent Tween-40. Cell surface antigens were recovered at a yield of 30-50%, and a purification of 30-40-fold. By contrast enzyme markers for the other cell organelles were present in the membrane fraction in very low yield. The membrane obtained with the detergent method was compared with that resulting from the best of previously describes methods involving cell lysis by shearing. The detergent method compared favourably for simplicity as well as for yield and purification, and both membrane preparations contained similar protein and glycoprotein constituents. The main glycoprotein bands of membranes from thymocytes and thoracic duct lymphocytes were identified after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in dodecyl sulphate. In thymocyte membrane, three main bands at apparent molecular weights of 150 000, 84 000 and 25 000 were seen, and of these the 84 000 glycoprotein did not bind to the lentil lectin.

Foal sera used included sera from pneumonic animals with known titer to equi factors; from animals bled monthly on a farm with enzootic pneumonia, and from animals bled monthly on a farm with no history of R. equi pneumonia. The humoral response of foals to somatic antigen preparations was negligible, with few differences noted between sera from healthy, subclinically affected, and sick foals. The humoral response to R. equi broth culture supernatant products appeared more marked and was related to equi factor antibody titer. These findings suggest that the humoral response to R. equi whole-cell antigens is unimportant in protection against disease, which is consistent with the behavior of the organism as a facultative intracellular pathogen.";-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3

Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified fraction followed by elution and renaturation of protein activity shows that the specificity factor is a 43-kDa polypeptide which directs mitochondrial core RNA polymerase to promoters belonging to rRNA-, tRNA-, and protein-encoding genes, as well as to mitochondrial replication origins.

1456647;Epithelial expression of HLA, secretory component (poly-Ig receptor), and adhesion molecules in the human alimentary tract.;Epithelial HLA class II is differentially expressed (DR >> DP) only after birth in salivary glands and small intestinal mucosa, in contrast to class I determinants and secretory component (SC) which appear early in gestation. However, there is a brisk postnatal increase in SC expression along with the class II induction, suggesting stimulation by cytokines from activated immune cells. T lymphocytes remain quite scanty in postnatal salivary glands, and the striking SC and class II expression might reflect a synergistic effect of IFN-gamma and TFN-alpha on immature epithelial cells. Enhanced epithelial expression of both SC and class II in salivary glands from sudden infant death victims could be the effect of immunostimulation caused by an infectious agent. Strikingly upregulated SC and epithelial class II expression (DR > DP > DQ) is seen in various inflammatory lesions such as obstructive sialadenitis, Sjögren's syndrome, chronic gastritis, and celiac disease. IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha are most likely involved as the expression patterns can be reproduced with these cytokines in vitro on colonic epithelial cell lines. However, these molecules of the Ig supergene family do not show a selective response in epithelia of inflammatory lesions because increased expression is also seen for lysozyme, lactoferrin and some other proteins. ICAM-1 can be upregulated on epithelial cells by various cytokines in vitro although the situation remains uncertain in mucosal inflammation. The expression pattern in IBD is complicated by dysplastic epithelial changes leading to reduced SC levels which may thus, in turn, jeopardize the poly-Ig transport mechanism. Epithelial class II molecules appear to have antigen-presenting properties, but the immunopathologic role of their increased expression in inflammatory disease in terms of induction of autoimmunity and/or abrogation of oral tolerance is a matter of continuing dispute.;isoleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

The 5' terminal sequence of the small RNA is ppApCpGp, which appears to be complementary to the 3' terminal sequence of the VSV genome RNA (...PypGpU).

26280335;An atomic structure of human γ-secretase.;Dysfunction of the intramembrane protease γ-secretase is thought to cause Alzheimer's disease, with most mutations derived from Alzheimer's disease mapping to the catalytic subunit presenilin 1 (PS1). Here we report an atomic structure of human γ-secretase at 3.4 Å resolution, determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. Mutations derived from Alzheimer's disease affect residues at two hotspots in PS1, each located at the centre of a distinct four transmembrane segment (TM) bundle. TM2 and, to a lesser extent, TM6 exhibit considerable flexibility, yielding a plastic active site and adaptable surrounding elements. The active site of PS1 is accessible from the convex side of the TM horseshoe, suggesting considerable conformational changes in nicastrin extracellular domain after substrate recruitment. Component protein APH-1 serves as a scaffold, anchoring the lone transmembrane helix from nicastrin and supporting the flexible conformation of PS1.

2423612;In vitro activation of murine antigen-specific memory B cells by a T-dependent antigen.;"A procedure that generates an enriched population (60 to 85%) of memory B cells specific for TNP (TNP-MABC) was employed. The activation requirements of TNP-MABC for the T-dependent antigen TNP-KLH and carrier-primed helper T (Th) cells were compared to those for TNP-binding cells from nonimmune mice (TNP-ABC). Proliferation and differentiation of TNP-MABC in response to cognate recognition of antigen requires less antigen and fewer carrier-primed Th cells than the activation of TNP-ABC. Furthermore, responses of the TNP-MABC were of a greater magnitude. Non-cognate activation induces a low level of proliferation of both TNP-ABC and TNP-MABC, but induces differentiation of TNP-MABC only. Percoll density fractionation of spleen cells prior to enrichment for TNP-MABC suggests that the small, dense cell population responds to cognate, but not to non-cognate activation. FACS separation of TNP-MABC by surface Ig isotype reveals that approximately 80% of the secondary IgG response is derived from cells expressing sIgG. Such cells constitute less than 10% of the total number of TNP-MABC. Limiting dilution studies with sorted TNP-MABC indicate that sIgG+ TNP-MABC are enriched for precursors that give rise to a large clone size. The in vitro results indicate the existence of three putative pathways for antigen-specific memory B cell activation by a T-dependent antigen: 1) sIgG+ cells differentiating into IgG-secreting cells; 2) sIgM+ cells differentiating into IgG-secreting cells; and 3) sIgM+ cells differentiating into IgM-secreting cells.";-;antigen;-;hard_2

6520497;[Morphological changes of the cervical spinal canal and cord due to aging].;"UNLABELLED
Cervical spondylotic myelopathy is a condition in which degenerative changes of the cervical vertebral bodies and the intervertebral discs cause disturbances to the spinal cord either by direct mechanical compression or by disturbing the blood supply. There have been a number of studies on roentgenological measurements of the anteroposterior (AP) diameter of the cervical spinal canal relating to the disorder. However, there are only a few reports concerning the shape and the size of the spinal canal and the spinal cord. Murone reported that the cervical spinal canal of Japanese was significantly smaller than those of Europeans on roentgenograms. However, whether the size of the spinal cord of Japanese is proportionally smaller or not remains to be studied. The aim of the present study is to perform various measurements of the human cervical spine specimens to find any influence of the age on them and to see relative correlation of the spinal cord size to the corresponding spinal canal size.


METHODS
Seventy-seven human cervical spinal columns taken én bloc from C3 to C7 at post-mortem examination were used for the study. After taking AP and lateral roentgenograms, the specimen was horizontally transsected at the middle of each vertebral body and at the level of each intervertebral disc. The reason why the middle of the vertebral body was selected is to exclude modifications by osteophyte formation at the upper and the lower ends of the body and to see possible genuine appearance and change of the spinal canal. The measured items were AP diameter of the vertebral body (A), AP diameter of the spinal canal (B), area of the spinal canal (C), AP diameter of the spinal cord (beta) and area of the spinal cord (gamma). In five untreated specimens, CT-scan was performed prior to the horizontal section, and the CT-scan findings were compared to those by direct measurements. Lateral cervical roentgenograms of 249 patients of various ages were used as a comparison.


RESULTS
The AP diameter of the vertebral body (A) and the AP diameter of the spinal canal (B) showed some correlation with the age. The former became larger whereas the latter became smaller with the age. The area of the spinal canal (C) did not show correlation with the age. The AP diameter of the spinal cord (beta) showed correlation with the age, whereas the area of the spinal cord (gamma) failed to show the correlation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)";-;-;-;hard_0
11841406;Immunochemical studies of antigenic lymphoma-associated proteins.;We have previously reported that plasma from patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive lymphoma contains antibodies against the oncogenic kinase NPM-ALK protein characteristic of this disease. We investigated whether this reactivity represents a phenomenon unique to ALK-positive lymphoma by screening plasma from patients with follicular lymphoma for antibodies to BCL-2 protein. Eight out of 10 samples showed such reactivity (and in six cases gave specific staining of BCL-2-transfected cells). As these findings suggest a new biochemical approach to the identification of oncogenic proteins in lymphoma, we investigated whether antibodies present in patients with ALK-positive lymphoma can precipitate NPM-ALK in quantities which should be sufficient for further analysis. We found that plasma samples from all10 patients studied immunoprecipitated NPM-ALK asaprotein visible in silver-stained sodium dodecyl sulphatepolyacrylamide gels. Finally we demonstrated that NPM-ALK could be visualized more clearly if it were immunoprecipitated from extracts of cells in which newly synthesized proteins had been labelled with 35S and then identified by autoradiography.

In the present study, in order to identify the LPS-binding protein on the murine erythrocyte membrane, a unique method to detect LPS-binding protein on a nitrocellulose membrane was developed. Murine erythrocyte membrane proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, then transferred electrophoretically onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with LPS of Salmonella minnesota R595 (Re LPS) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), after the remaining sites were blocked with gelatin in PBS. We were able to obtain a non-background stain by adding the nonionic detergent octylglucoside at the low concentration of 0.1% to the Re LPS solution. The Re LPS bound to the protein on the nitrocellulose membrane was exposed to affinity purified anti-Re LPS antibodies (IgG) and then to alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-IgG. The alkaline phosphatase was detected on the membrane by an enzymatic reaction. This method demonstrated that Re LPS was bound to an erythrocyte protein of 96 kDa. Treatment of erythrocytes with Pronase led to disappearance of the Re LPS-binding protein on the erythrocyte membrane. There was no difference between LPS-responder and LPS-nonresponder murine erythrocyte membranes in amount and molecular weight of the Re LPS-binding protein.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
2719655;The cilia of Paramecium tetraurelia contain both Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-inhibitable calmodulin-binding proteins.;To identify protein targets for calmodulin (CaM) in the cilia of Paramecium tetraurelia, we employed a 125I-CaM blot assay after resolution of ciliary proteins on SDS/polyacrylamide gels. Two distinct types of CaM-binding proteins were detected. One group bound 125I-CaM at free Ca2+ concentrations above 0.5-1 microM and included a major binding activity of 63 kDa (C63) and activities of 126 kDa (C126), 96 kDa (C96), and 36 kDa (C36). CaM bound these proteins with high (nanomolar) affinity and specificity relative to related Ca2+ receptors. The second type of protein bound 125I-CaM only when the free Ca2+ concentration was below 1-2 microM and included polypeptides of 95 kDa (E95) and 105 kDa (E105). E105 may also contain Ca2+-dependent binding sites for CaM. Both E95 and E105 exhibited strong specificity for Paramecium CaM over bovine CaM. Ciliary subfractionation experiments suggested that C63, C126, C96, E95, and E105 are bound to the axoneme, whereas C36 is a soluble and/or membrane-associated protein. Additional Ca2+-dependent CaM-binding proteins of 63, 70, and 120 kDa were found associated with ciliary membrane vesicles. In support of these results, filtration binding assays also indicated high-affinity binding sites for CaM on isolated intact axonemes and suggested the presence of both Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-inhibitable targets. Like E95 and E105, the Ca2+-inhibitable CaM-binding sites showed strong preference for Paramecium CaM over vertebrate CaM and troponin C. Together, these results suggest that CaM has multiple targets in the cilium and hence may regulate ciliary motility in a complex and pleiotropic fashion.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
2446798;Characteristics of antibodies adsorbed on the DNA immunoadsorbent, agarose poly-L-lysine-DNA.;"Agarose-poly-L-lysine (Ag-(lys)n-DNA) has been used to bind DNA for assay of anti-DNA antibodies (ab). In this work, an algorithmic approach has been used to classify antinuclear ab (ANA) as being directed against native DNA (dsDNA), denatured DNA (ssDNA), DNA-protein complexes (deoxyribonucleoprotein; DNP), and against antigens which are independent of DNA (iDNA). These ab were subjected to Ag-(lys)n-DNA, and the selectivity of this adsorbent for the various specificities of ab was determined. The DNA on the columns was left untreated or treated with S1 nuclease, this being effected either by treating the DNA prior to introducing it onto the columns or by adding S1 nuclease to the columns after the DNA was bound. Ag-(lys)n-DNA adsorbs ab directed against ssDNA and DNP as well as ab to dsDNA; iDNA ab are not adsorbed. S1 nuclease treatment does not effectively remove ssDNA regions from the Ag-(lys)n-DNA, but it does result in the abolition of the adsorption of a population of ab which are in the anti-DNP sera and contribute to the total ANA load. While anti-iDNA ab are not adsorbed onto the columns, they do contribute to the ANA titer, unlike anti-ssDNA ab which are adsorbed onto the Ag-(lys)n-DNA but do not contribute to the ANA titer. We conclude that Ag-(lys)n-DNA bears antigenic sites for dsDNA, ssDNA, and DNP ab and suggest that our understanding of the characteristic ab-binding profile of this versatile immunoadsorbent may have applications in the study of autoimmune diseases.";-;antigen;poly-L-;hard_3
1573062;Neurotrophic activity of interphotoreceptor matrix on human Y79 retinoblastoma cells.;A neurotrophic activity of adult monkey and bovine interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM) was examined by using cultured human Y79 retinoblastoma cells as a model system. The cells were stimulated for 7 days in suspension culture with soluble IPM components and then attached to poly-D-lysine substratum. IPMs from both species induced greater than 80% neuronal differentiation of Y79 cell aggregates after 11 days of attachment as adjudged morphologically by the extension of lengthy, neurite-like processes. Immunocytochemical studies indicate that differentiated Y79 cells had an increased level of expression of neuron-specific enolase and a concomitant decreased expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein. This neurotrophic activity cannot be ascribed to nerve growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, or transforming growth factor beta. Although the nature of the factor and its cellular source have yet to be characterized, it may be related to a recently described neurotrophic protein secreted by human fetal retinal pigment epithelial cells in culture. Our findings provide evidence supporting the neuroblastic potential of the Y79 cell line and indicate that the IPM contains a potent neurotrophic activity. Such factors may be important to normal differentiation and maintenance of function of the neural retina.;aspartic_acid;-;-;LCR_without_function
9285650;A new predictor of restenosis after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease.;With the goal of improving prediction of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) for multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD), we evaluated the usefulness of serial exercise treadmill tests. We previously reported that an increase in the deltaST/delta heart rate (HR) index at follow-up over the value obtained several days after PTCA was useful for detecting restenosis following PTCA for 1-vessel CAD. In that report, comparison of the deltaST/deltaHR index was made based on measurements from the lead disclosing the greatest ST displacement before PTCA. This method was not applicable to patients with multivessel CAD. Seventy-eight patients with multivessel CAD before and several days after PTCA and just before follow-up performed exercise treadmill tests. Simple HR-adjusted indexes of ST-segment depression during exercise (deltaST/deltaHR index) and the sum of the deltaST/deltaHR index in leads II, III, aVF, V4, V5, and V6 (sigma deltaST/deltaHR index) were determined. We compared the predictive power of an increase in sigma deltaST/deltaHR index at follow-up with that of a positive exercise treadmill test and a positive thallium scintigram for restenosis. At follow-up, 37 of the 78 patients showed restenosis. The sigma deltaST/deltaHR index had increased in 30 of these 37 patients (81%), and in 12 of the 41 patients (29%) without restenosis. An increase in sigma deltaST/deltaHR index had a significantly higher sensitivity than the other methods and a significantly higher specificity than a positive exercise treadmill test.;-;-;-;hard_0
2379503;Tooth 'enamelins' identified mainly as serum proteins. Major 'enamelin' is albumin.;"The major enamelin protein component present in EDTA or EDTA/guanidine hydrochloride extracts of developing bovine enamel has a molecular mass of about 67 kDa; it has an amino acid composition similar to that of bovine serum albumin and reacts with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to albumin. Two-dimensional separation of the components in the enamelin extract by isoelectric focusing and SDS/PAGE reveal that the major approximately 67-kDa component and almost all of the minor Coomassie-staining protein components of approximately 67 kDa, as well as many of the other minor components with different molecular masses, also react with polyclonal and monoclonal antialbumin. The approximately 67-kDa band eluted after SDS/PAGE, as well as the major approximately 67-kDa spots eluted after two-dimensional separation, were found to have N-terminal amino acid sequences identical to that of bovine serum albumin. Albumin accounted for at least 70-80% of the total protein content of the enamelin extract and was essentially the only protein in the approximately 67-kDa component. The serum proteins alpha-2 HS glycoprotein, gamma-globulin and fetuin, and the proline-rich salivary protein termed P-B were also identified in the enamelin extract. The serum proteins and the salivary protein account for greater than 95% of the proteins in the enamelin extracts. Of the remaining very small amounts of non-serum or salivary protein isolated from the enamelin extracts, three minor components were isolated which had N-terminal amino acid sequences which were not similar to any known protein in the protein sequence data base and could therefore conceivably be true 'enamelins' synthesized by ameloblasts. One additional protein had the first five N-terminal amino acids and residue 8 of amelogenin, residues 6 and 7 being different from those of amelogenin. Two other very minor protein components had amino acid compositions distinct from the amelogenins and the serum proteins, but were N-terminally blocked on attempted sequencing. None of the components in the neutral soluble low-ionic-strength extract or in the 4 M guanidine hydrochloride extract, both of which consist principally of amelogenins, immunoreacted with anti-albumin or with any of the antibodies to other serum proteins and fetuin, despite the fact that the amelogenin extracts also contain non-amelogenin proteins. On the basis of the data presented, studies employing antibodies to the so-called enamelin proteins and hypotheses as to their molecular conformation, their roles as evolutionary markers, or their positive role in mineralization should be reconsidered and reviewed.";proline;-;-;LCR_without_function
1763054;Terminal region recognition factor 1, a DNA-binding protein recognizing the inverted terminal repeats of the pGKl linear DNA plasmids.;The yeast linear DNA plasmids pGKl1 and pGKl2 contain inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) and terminal proteins covalently bound to the 5' termini of each plasmid. The presence of these features suggests a protein-primed mechanism of DNA replication, similar to that exemplified by mammalian adenovirus and phi 29 phage of Bacillus subtilis. In this paper, we report the identification of an activity in cytoplasmic extracts of yeast harboring the pGKl plasmids that recognizes the termini of both pGKl1 and pGKl2. We call this activity TRF1, for terminal region recognition factor 1. Deletion analyses and DNase I protection experiments demonstrate that the activity recognizes base pairs 107-183 within the ITR of pGKl1, and base pairs 126-179 within the ITR of pGKl2. The presence of T-tracts within these two regions, but otherwise dissimilar nucleotide sequences, suggests that TRF1 recognizes a common structural feature within the ITRs of the two plasmids. TRF1 has been partially purified from yeast cytoplasmic extracts and Southwestern analysis indicates that the apparent molecular mass of the protein is 16 kDa. By expressing three open reading frames from pGKl2 in Escherichia coli, we found that open reading frame 10 (ORF10) of pGKl2 encodes TRF1. The sequence of the ORF10 gene product indicates that TRF1 is a highly basic protein of small molecular mass. Comparison of TRF1 with other DNA-binding proteins known to recognize the terminal regions of linear DNAs, such as NFI and NFIII involved in adenovirus DNA replication, and phi 29 p6, involved in phi 29 DNA replication, indicates that TRF1 has a different mode of binding.;threonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function
3780886;Purification and properties of glutathione reductases from bovine ciliary body.;Two glutathione reductases, designated GR-I and GR-II, were purified from bovine ciliary body to apparent homogeneity by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-agarose and gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200. The two enzymes were isolated whether protease inhibitors were included or not in the medium during tissue homogenization. GR-I was found to have a molecular weight of about 140,000 by gel filtration and be composed of two identical subunits. On the other hand, GR-II was shown to exist as aggregates with molecular weights larger than 670,000. The subunit molecular weight of GR-II was estimated to be about 45,000 by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The high molecular aggregate dissociated into smaller species by treatment with mercaptoethanol. The isoelectric points of GR-I and GR-II were determined to be 5.8 and 6.4, respectively. The K'm values for NADPH and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) were 22- and 84 microM for GR-I and 11- and 98 microM for GR-II. Coenzyme A-glutathione disulfide served as a substrate, though it was much less reactive than oxidized glutathione, for both enzymes. S-alkyl glutathiones were inactive as substrates. Nitrofurantoin was a non-competitive inhibitor of the enzymes. 1,3-bis(2 chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) inhibited GR-I and GR-II irreversibly. The two enzymes are similar, if not identical, in their amino-acid composition. The two enzymes are also very similar on the basis of the relative position of tryptic peptides separated in two-dimensional peptide maps. From the tissue content and turnover numbers of these enzymes it is concluded that bovine ciliary body has a sufficient capability for rapid reduction of oxidized glutathione produced in the tissue during glutathione-dependent peroxide detoxification.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1

Good protein recoveries were also obtained in the same buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 only. The efficiency of elution was practically independent of the molecular weight of proteins, the method allowed for the precise excision of protein bands, and the proteins eluted from the matrix were not degraded. In some cases it was possible to recover enzymatic activity of the eluted proteins.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
1572526;Isolation of three novel Drosophila melanogaster genes containing repetitive sequences rich in GCN triplets.;"Several cDNA and genomic clones were isolated from Drosophila melanogaster gene libraries by hybridization with a region of a mammalian gene that contains a simple repetitive sequence of six GCN repeats. One of the cDNA clones, E6, was completely sequenced and it was shown that it contains a region of 16 GCN repeats; these repeats encode a polyalanine stretch within a long open reading frame. The sequencing of three different genomic clones (A, B, and D) revealed that all the isolated Drosophila clones are similar to one another in a short region containing variable numbers of the GCN repeat. The genomic clone B was found to be the genomic counterpart of the cDNA clone E6. The other genomic clones, A and D, also hybridize with Drosophila cDNA clones at high stringency. These results indicate that the short GCN repetitive sequences, which we have named ala, are found within transcribed regions of the Drosophila genome. These Drosophila genes containing the ala repeat do not show significant sequence similarity to any presently known gene; we have named these novel genes ala-A, ala-B, and ala-D.

507195;Properties of metastatic and nonmetastatic cloned subpopulations of an ultraviolet-light-induced murine fibrosarcoma of recent origin.;The present studies were designed to evaluate whether tumor cell properties such as growth rate, chromosome number, anchorage-independent growth, susceptibility to lymphocyte- or macrophage-mediated lysis in vitro, and antigenicity in vivo correlated with metastatic potential. A murine fibrosarcoma of recent origin induced in a C3H- mouse by chronic irradiation with ultraviolet light was used. Cells from the parent tumor and its clones were grown in culture. No single property of tumor cells that was measured in vitro or in vivo predicted or correlated with their metastatic potential. In order for metastasis to occur, all steps of the process must be completed. Therefore, interruption of the sequence at any stage can prevent the production of visible metastasis. It was concluded that the search for a single property common to all metastatic cells in a large variety of neoplasms is likely to be unproductive.;-;antigen;-;hard_2

6504141;Somatic mutation and the maturation of immune response to 2-phenyl oxazolone.;Studies on the development of the immune response suggest that the repertoire of expressed antibody specificities is strongly influenced by antigen (reviewed in ref. 1). One way in which this influence is manifested is by a progressive increase in the affinity of antibody for antigen with time after immunization. This phenomenon, termed the 'maturation' of the immune response, must be due to a change in the structure of the antibody being synthesized. However, the precise nature of the changes involved and the genetic mechanisms used to produce them have not been clearly defined. We have now investigated the maturation of the immune response to the hapten 2-phenyloxazolone by mRNA sequencing of specific hybridomas. We conclude that somatic mutation of germ-line encoded genes plays a major role in the generation of antibodies with increased affinity for oxazolone with time after immunization.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
11867432;New stochastic strategy to analyze helix folding.;We propose an alternative stochastic strategy to search secondary structures based on the generalized simulated annealing (GSA) algorithm, by using conformational preferences based on the Ramachandran map. We optimize the search for polypeptide conformational space and apply to peptides considered to be good alpha-helix promoters above a critical number of residues. Our strategy to obtain conformational energies consist in coupling a classical force field (THOR package) with the GSA procedure, biasing the Phi x Psi backbone angles to the allowed regions in the Ramachandran map. For polyalanines we obtained stable alpha-helix structures when the number of residues were equal or exceeded 13 amino acids residues. We also observed that the energy gap between the global minimum and the first local minimum tends to increase with the polypeptide size. These conformations were generated by performing 2880 stochastic molecular optimizations with a continuum medium approach. When compared with molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo methods, GSA can be considered the fastest. ;-;helix;-;hard_2
1435731;The region essential for efficient autonomous replication of pSa in Escherichia coli.;Comparative analyses were made between plasmid pSa17, a deletion derivative of pSa that is capable of replicating efficiently in Escherichia coli and plasmid pSa3, a derivative that is defective for replication. By comparing the restriction maps of these two derivatives, the regions essential for replication and for stable maintenance of the plasmid were determined. A 2.5 kb DNA segment bearing the origin of DNA replication of pSa17 was sequenced. A 36 kDa RepA protein was encoded in the region essential for replication. Downstream of the RepA coding region was a characteristic sequence including six 17 bp direct repeats, the possible binding sites of RepA protein, followed by AT-rich and GC-rich sequences. Furthermore, an 8 bp incomplete copy of the 17 bp repeat was found in the promoter region of the repA gene. Based on the hypothesis that RepA protein binds to this partial sequence as well as to intact 17 bp sequences, an autoregulatory system for the synthesis of RepA protein may be operative. Another open reading frame (ORF) was found in the region required for the stability of the plasmid. The putative protein encoded in this ORF showed significant homology to several site-specific recombination proteins. A possible role of this putative protein in stable maintenance of the plasmid is discussed.;cysteine;-;-;LCR_without_function

2036428;Serine-specific phosphorylation of nicotinic receptor associated 43K protein.;In Torpedo marmorata electroplaque, an extrinsic membrane protein of apparent mass 43,000 daltons colocalizes with the cytoplasmic face of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) in approximately 1:1 stoichiometry. We show that this 43K protein can be phosphorylated in vitro by endogenous protein kinases present in AChR-rich membranes. The extent of 43K protein phosphorylation exceeds that of the subunits of the AChR, well-established substrates for enzymatic phosphorylation. We demonstrate that significant 43K phosphoprotein exists in vivo. The kinetics of phosphate incorporation mediated by endogenous kinases differed significantly from those of the AChR subunits, suggesting that different phosphorylation cascades are involved. Use of specific inhibitors of a variety of protein kinases indicated that endogenous cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalyzes phosphorylation of the 43K protein in vitro. All of the phosphate incorporated into 43K protein was accounted for by phosphoserine (0.65 mol/mol of 43K protein).

Of the 964 men responding, 173 (18%) reported a history of depression, including 69 (7%) whose depressions were serious enough to result in a major life upset. The 318 respondents with some alcohol- or drug- related life impairment (33%) were unevenly distributed among the three depressive history groups, with 44% to 48% of those with depressions also reporting substance problems while the same was true for only 30% of the depression-free men.

24121681;Conformational and thermodynamic hallmarks of DNA operator site specificity in the copper sensitive operon repressor from Streptomyces lividans.;Metal ion homeostasis in bacteria relies on metalloregulatory proteins to upregulate metal resistance genes and enable the organism to preclude metal toxicity. The copper sensitive operon repressor (CsoR) family is widely distributed in bacteria and controls the expression of copper efflux systems. CsoR operator sites consist of G-tract containing pseudopalindromes of which the mechanism of operator binding is poorly understood. Here, we use a structurally characterized CsoR from Streptomyces lividans (CsoR(Sl)) together with three specific operator targets to reveal the salient features pertaining to the mechanism of DNA binding. We reveal that CsoR(Sl) binds to its operator site through a 2-fold axis of symmetry centred on a conserved 5'-TAC/GTA-3' inverted repeat. Operator recognition is stringently dependent not only on electropositive residues but also on a conserved polar glutamine residue. Thermodynamic and circular dichroic signatures of the CsoR(Sl)-DNA interaction suggest selectivity towards the A-DNA-like topology of the G-tracts at the operator site. Such properties are enhanced on protein binding thus enabling the symmetrical binding of two CsoR(Sl) tetramers. Finally, differential binding modes may exist in operator sites having more than one 5'-TAC/GTA-3' inverted repeat with implications in vivo for a mechanism of modular control.  ;glycine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

We have now examined the affinity of reovirus proteins for DNA, postulating that such affinity could provide a mechanism for the inhibition. Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of cells labeled with [35S] methionine from 6 to 8.5 h after infection at high multiplicity was subjected to chromatography on denatured DNA - cellulose columns. Fractions from both cytoplasm and nucleus eluted with 0.6 N NaCl contained a protein with the same electrophoretic mobility of polyacrylamide slab gels as the nonstructural (NS) reovirus protein of the sigma size class. The protein also exhibited affinity for native DNA - cellulose and denatured DNA - agarose. Electrophoretic analysis is tube gels of cell extracts labeled for 48 h before infection with [14C] leucine and from 6 to 8.5 h after infection with [3H] leucine showed increased 3H label in this protein indicating it is reovirus specific. Small amounts of mu proteins also had DNA affinity. Purified virus did not bind strongly to DNA, suggesting that the binding protein is not a structural protein of the sigma size class on the outer surface of the virus. Our results provide evidence that the sigma NS protein binds to DNA. This affinity could interfere with chromosome function in the infected cell.;-;nucleic acid binding;polyacrylamide;hard_3

10828006;Translational pathophysiology: a novel molecular mechanism of human disease.;In higher eukaryotes, the expression of about 1 gene in 10 is strongly regulated at the level of messenger RNA (mRNA) translation into protein. Negative regulatory effects are often mediated by the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) and rely on the fact that the 40S ribosomal subunit first binds to the cap structure at the 5'-end of mRNA and then scans for the first AUG codon. Self-complementary sequences can form stable stem-loop structures that interfere with the assembly of the preinitiation complex and/or ribosomal scanning. These stem loops can be further stabilized by the interaction with RNA-binding proteins, as in the case of ferritin. The presence of AUG codons located upstream of the physiological start site can inhibit translation by causing premature initiation and thereby preventing the ribosome from reaching the physiological start codon, as in the case of thrombopoietin (TPO). Recently, mutations that cause disease through increased or decreased efficiency of mRNA translation have been discovered, defining translational pathophysiology as a novel mechanism of human disease. Hereditary hyperferritinemia/cataract syndrome arises from various point mutations or deletions within a protein-binding sequence in the 5'-UTR of the L-ferritin mRNA. Each unique mutation confers a characteristic degree of hyperferritinemia and severity of cataract in affected individuals. Hereditary thrombocythemia (sometimes called familial essential thrombocythemia or familial thrombocytosis) can be caused by mutations in upstream AUG codons in the 5'-UTR of the TPO mRNA that normally function as translational repressors. Their inactivation leads to excessive production of TPO and elevated platelet counts. Finally, predisposition to melanoma may originate from mutations that create translational repressors in the 5'-UTR of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-2A gene.;-;nucleic acid binding;-;hard_2
26757361;The Involvement of Splicing Factor hnRNP A1 in UVB-induced Alternative Splicing of hdm2.;"Human homolog double minute 2 (hdm2), an oncoprotein, which binds to tumor suppressor p53 to facilitate its degradation, has been known to contribute to tumorigenesis. Its splicing variants are reported to be highly expressed in many cancers and can be induced by ultraviolet B light (UVB). However, the mechanisms of how UVB radiation induces hdm2 alternative splicing still remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the roles of two common splicing factors, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNP) A1 and serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1), in regulating UVB-induced hdm2 splicing. Our study indicated that while the expression of both hnRNP A1 and SRSF1 are induced, only hnRNP A1 is involved in hdm2 alternative splicing upon UVB irradiation. Overexpression of hnRNP A1 resulted in decrease of full-length hdm2 (hdm2-FL) and increase of hdm2B, one of hdm2 alternate-splicing forms; while down-regulated hnRNP A1 expression led to the decrease of the hdm2-FL and hdm2B in HaCaT cells. Protein-mRNA binding assay confirmed that UVB irradiation could increase the binding of hnRNP A1 to hdm2 pre-mRNA. In conclusion, we elucidated that UVB induces alternative splicing of hdm2 by increasing the expression and the binding of hnRNP A1 to hdm2 full-length mRNA.

2440562;Molecular nature of a cell membrane antigen specific for human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.;"In the present work, we characterized the molecular nature of a T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T ALL) specific antigen, termed TALLA, which is defined by monoclonal antibody SN1. SN1 shows an extremely high specificity for T ALL. In the present study, SN1 was further shown not to react significantly with various normal solid tissues. TALLA was determined to be a glycoprotein with an approximate molecular weight of 150,000. However, the molecular nature of TALLA is peculiar in that heating at 100 degrees C for 2 min renders TALLA undetectable in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It should be noted that such heating is a common practice before analysis of proteins and glycoproteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. No significant antigenic modulation of TALLA was observed when T ALL cells were reacted with SN1. Two new monoclonal antibodies, SN1a and SN1b, which show the same cell binding specificity as SN1 were also generated in the present work and compared to SN1. Competitive binding experiments showed that the epitopes on TALLA recognized by SN1, SN1a, and SN1b are sufficiently close to one another to allow complete reciprocal inhibition of antibody binding. These epitopes apparently became more exposed to antibody when T ALL cells were treated with neuraminidase; neuraminidase-treated T ALL cells bind 29-35% more SN1, SN1a, and SN1b as compared to the original T ALL cells.";-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
10435638;Cell cycle arrest and morphological alterations following microinjection of NIH3T3 cells with Pur alpha.;Levels of Pur alpha, a protein implicated in control of both DNA replication and gene transcription, fluctuate during the cell cycle, being lowest in early S phase and highest just after mitosis. Here we have employed a new video time-lapse technique enabling us to determine the cell cycle position of each cell in an asynchronous culture at a given time and to ask whether introduction of Pur alpha protein at specific times can affect cell cycle progression. Approximately 80% of all NIH3T3 cells injected with Pur alpha were inhibited from passing through mitosis. Cells injected with Pur alpha during S or G2 phases were efficiently blocked with a 4N (G2 phase) DNA level, as determined by quantitative DNA photometry of individual cells. Of the cells injected with Pur alpha during G1 phase, 40% experienced a rapid cell death characterized by extreme cellular fragmentation.

31629567;TFPR1 acts as an immune regulator and an efficient adjuvant for proteins and peptides by activating immune cells, primarily through TLR2.;Triflin, a non-toxic protein found in the venom of the Habu snake, belongs to the CRISP (cysteine-rich secretory protein) family, which comprises two domains: a C-terminal cysteine-rich domain (CRD) and an N-terminal pathogenesis-related-1 (PR-1) domain. The function of the highly structurally conserved PR-1 domain is unknown. Here, we successfully expressed the PR-1 domain of triflin (hereafter called TFPR1) in E. coli. Animal experiments showed that TFPR1 augmented Th1-biased antibody- and cell-mediated immune responses in mice immunized with two protein antigens (OVA and HBsAg) or a peptide antigen (HIV-1 pep). A flow cytometry-based binding assay and in vitro stimulation with TFPR1 showed that it triggered Th1-biased proinflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokine secretion primarily by binding to B cells and macrophages within the mouse splenocyte population. Quantitative RT-PCR, antibody blocking assays using a specific anti-mTLR2 antibody, and stimulatory experiments in vitro using splenocytes from TLR2-KO mice demonstrated that TFPR1 activated murine immune cells, primarily by stimulating toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). These results suggest that TFPR1 acts as a novel immune modulator and potent adjuvant primarily by activating TLR2. Thus, the PR-1-based core domain might play a role in immune regulation. ;cysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
19956621;Cofactor-activated phosphorylation is required for inhibition of cortical neuron differentiation by Groucho/TLE1.;"Transcriptional co-repressors of the Groucho/transducin-like Enhancer of split (Gro/TLE) family regulate the expression of a variety of genes and are involved in numerous developmental processes in both invertebrate and vertebrate species. More specifically, Gro/TLE1 participates in mechanisms that inhibit/delay the differentiation of cerebral cortex neural progenitor cells into neurons during mammalian forebrain development. The anti-neurogenic function of Gro/TLE1 depends on the formation of protein complexes with specific DNA-binding transcription factors that engage Gro/TLE1 through WRP(W/Y) sequences. Interaction with those transcription partners results in Gro/TLE1 recruitment to selected DNA sites and causes increased Gro/TLE1 phosphorylation. The physiological significance of the latter event, termed ""cofactor-activated phosphorylation,"" had not been determined. Therefore, this study aimed at clarifying the role of cofactor-activated phosphorylation in the anti-neurogenic function of Gro/TLE1. A combination of site-directed mutagenesis, mass spectrometry, biochemistry, primary cell culture, and immunocytochemical assays was utilized to characterize point mutations of Ser-286, a residue that is phosphorylated in vivo and is located within the serine/proline-rich (SP) domain of Gro/TLE1. Mutation of Ser-286 to alanine or glutamic acid does not perturb the interaction of Gro/TLE1 with DNA-binding partners, including the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Hes1, a prototypical anti-neurogenic WRP(W/Y) motif protein. Ser-286 mutations do not prevent the recruitment of Gro/TLE1 to DNA, but they impair cofactor-activated phosphorylation and weaken the interaction of Gro/TLE1 with chromatin. These effects are correlated with an impairment of the anti-neurogenic activity of Gro/TLE1. Similar results were obtained when mutations of Ser-289 and Ser-298, which are also located within the SP domain of Gro/TLE1, were analyzed. Based on the positive correlation between Gro/TLE1 cofactor-activated phosphorylation and ability to inhibit cortical neuron differentiation, we propose that hyperphosphorylation induced by cofactor binding plays a positive role in the regulation of Gro/TLE1 anti-neurogenic activity.

1777119;Murine red blood cells as efficient carriers of three bacterial antigens for the production of specific and neutralizing antibodies.;Three bacterial toxoids, CRM 197 (mutagenized diphtheria toxin), tetanus toxoid (formaldehyde-treated tetanus toxin), and PT-9K/129G (double mutant of pertussin toxin) were encapsulated within red blood cells (RBCs) of B6D2F1 and Balb/C mice according to a mild procedure based on hypotonic dialysis-isotonic resealing that yielded undamaged RBCs. The toxoid-loaded RBCs were injected intravenously in order to immunize animals and their effects were compared to those of identical amounts (30-95 micrograms per mouse subdivided into multiple injections) of the corresponding free toxoids injected intravenously in saline. Sera from treated mice were collected and tested for titers of specific antibodies against each of the three antigens and also for titers of neutralizing antibodies, i.e., affording protection from toxic effects induced by the corresponding native toxins. In all experiments, significant seroconversion was observed with both immunization systems. Titers of both specific and neutralizing antibodies against CRM 197 and tetanus toxoid were several-fold higher upon immunization with the RBC-encapsulated toxoids, than with the free toxoids. These differences were not due to qualitatively different recognition patterns of antigenic determinants by the two types of sera. Conversely, intravenous immunization with pertussis toxoid either as RBC-encapsulated or as free antigen elicited a comparably high production of specific and of neutralizing antibodies. These data demonstrate that properly engineered RBCs behave as natural carriers and possibly adjuvants for antigens of vaccinal interest.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
16636674;AP-2alpha and AP-2gamma are transcriptional targets of p53 in human breast carcinoma cells.;Activating enhancer-binding protein 2alpha (AP-2alpha) and activating enhancer-binding protein 2gamma (AP-2gamma) are transcription factors that bind GC-rich consensus sequences and regulate the expression of many downstream genes. AP-2alpha and AP-2gamma interact with p53 both physically and functionally. Expression microarray results in human breast carcinoma cells with forced p53 expression revealed AP-2gamma as a putative transcriptional target of p53. To confirm and extend these findings we measured the effects of forced p53 expression in human breast carcinoma cells by real-time reverse transcription-PCR, Western blotting, electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays, promoter reporter, chromatin immunoprecipitation and chromatin accessibility assays. Wild-type p53 expression rapidly induced not only AP-2gamma but also AP-2alpha mRNA. The subsequent increase in these proteins led to increased AP-2 DNA-binding and transactivating activity. Candidate p53-binding sites were identified in the AP-2alpha and AP-2gamma promoters. p53 binding to these cis-elements in vivo was also observed, together with a relaxation of chromatin structure in these regions. Finally, expression of either AP-2alpha or gamma inhibited growth of human breast carcinoma cells in vitro. Taken together, our findings indicate that these AP-2 genes are targets for transcriptional activation by p53 and suggest that AP-2 proteins may mediate some of the downstream effects of p53 expression such as inhibition of proliferation. ;cysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
8661939;Conversion of energy in halobacteria: ATP synthesis and phototaxis;Halobacteria are aerobic chemo-organotroph archaea that grow optimally between pH 8 and 9 using a wide range of carbon sources. These archaea have developed alternative processes of energy provision for conditions of high cell densities and the reduced solubility of molecular oxygen in concentrated brines. The halobacteria can switch to anaerobic metabolism by using an alternative final acceptor in the respiratory chain or by fermentation, or alternatively, they can employ photophosphorylation. Light energy is converted by several retinal-containing membrane proteins that, in addition to generating a proton gradient across the cell membrane, also make phototaxis possible in order to approach optimal light conditions. The structural and functional features of ATP synthesis in archaea are discussed, and similarities to F-ATPases (functional aspects) or vacuolar ATPases (structural aspects) are presented.;-;-;-;hard_0
402265;Membrane fractions from the outer layers of spores of Bacillus thuringiensis with toxicity to lepidopterous larvae.;"Two membrane fractions, F1 and F2, have been purified from the outer layers of spores of Bacillus thuringiensis. Both fractions contain 6-7% cysteine and appear to be similar in composition. Amino acids account for about 75% of the dry weight, carbohydrate for about 2% and lipids for about 25%. The fractions are both toxic to Pieris brassicae and the toxicity is inactivated by antiserum to the toxic crystal of Bacillus thuringiensis. The fractions can be distinguished by examination under the electron microscope; both fractions show similar hexagonal patterns but with different spacings. The same fractions from an acrystaliferous mutant (cr) were prepared. These were identical in density and in appearance under the electron microscope; the amino acid analysis of fraction F2 from both strains was identical. However, the spores and fractions F1 and F2 from this strain lacked toxicity. Fraction F2 from the cr strain was used to prepare antiserum specific to fraction F2. Using this anti-serum and anticrystal serum, crystal and F2 antigens were shown to appear simultaneously in sporulating cultures. Crystal and F2 antigens appeared some time before the maximum rate of uptake of [35s]cysteine. It is concluded that fraction F2 is derived from the exosporium and that fraction F1 probably originates from the spore coat. The exosporium in Bacillus thuringiensis appears to be synthesised during stages II and III of sporulation although uptake of [35S]cysteine occurs much later.";-;antigen;-;hard_2
7197275;Electrophoretic analysis of the stored histone pool in unfertilized sea urchin eggs: quantification and identification by antibody binding.;A maternal store of histones in unfertilized sea urchin eggs is demonstrated by two independent criteria. Stored histones are identified by their ability to assemble into chromatin of male pronuclei of fertilized sea urchin eggs in the absence of protein synthesis, suggesting a minimum of at least 25 haploid equivalents for each histone present and functional in the unfertilized egg. In addition, electrophoretic analysis of proteins from acid extracts of unfertilized whole eggs and enucleated merogons reveals protein spots comigrating with cleavage stage histone standards, though not with other histone variants found in later sea urchin development or in sperm. Quantification of the amount of protein per histone spot yields an estimate of several hundred haploid DNA equivalents per egg of stored histone. The identity of some of the putative histones was verified by a highly sensitive immunological technique, involving electrophoretic transfer of proteins from the two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose filters.

8231898;Schistosoma mansoni: surface membrane isolation with lectin-coated beads.;Lectins from Lens culinaris and Arachis hypogaea immobilized on polyacrylamide beads were used for selective isolation of glycosylated surface membrane domains of adult Schistosoma mansoni worms, and the method was compared with the membrane isolation procedure developed with polycationic (Affi-Gel) beads. The lentil lectin proved to be suitable for interaction with surface membrane components: an increment in the specific activities of tegumental phosphohydrolases was observed in the bound fraction with respect to that observed in a total worm homogenate. A characteristic polypeptide pattern on gel electrophoresis was also seen, more restricted than that obtained with the bound Affi-Gel fraction. Immobilized peanut lectin was not successful as a method for isolating membrane material from the tegument of adult worms. Solubilization and dissociation of the lentil lectin-bound enzyme markers was achieved after addition of detergent and competing sugars. Glycosylation of the solubilized enzymes was further confirmed by affinity chromatography with fresh lentil lectin-coated beads. These results, together with histochemical evidences, suggest that the active sites of some of these enzymes are located within or close to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the surface tegumental membranes, and allow us to propose a model for the double surface membrane complex where some proteins may be crossing the two bilayers.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
6889490;Some physicochemical characteristics of photoaffinity-labeled rabbit androgen-binding protein.;Photoaffinity-labeled androgen-binding protein (ABP), present in cytosol prepared from the caput epididymidis of intact sexually mature rabbits, was produced using 17 beta-hydroxy-[1,2-3H]4,6-androstadien-3-one (delta 6-testosterone). Photo-labeled ABP could not be distinguished from unlabeled ABP by gel filtration chromatography, electrophoresis on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, or sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. Rabbit ABP was found to have a sedimentation coefficient of 4.6S and a Stokes radium of approximately 45A. Based on these parameters, its native molecular weight was calculated to be approximately 86,300. A model of ABP as a prolate ellipsoid having an axial ratio of 10 is consistent with its frictional ratio of 1.555. When photolabeled rabbit ABP was examined on polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate, two androgen-specific peaks of approximately 52,000 and approximately 48,000 daltons were detected. Both peaks contained approximately the same amount of radioactivity. When photolabeled ABP was treated with the cross-linking reagent disuccinimidyl suberate before electrophoresis on gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate, an additional androgen-specific peak corresponding to approximately 100,000 daltons was obtained. We interpret this peak to represent dimers of the lower molecular weight species. The 52,000- and 48,000-dalton subunits were observed regardless of whether the proteins were treated with 2-mercaptoethanol, indicating that the monomers are not linked by disulfide bonds.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
9990493;The rehabilitation process for the geriatric stroke patient--an exploratory study of goal setting and interventions.;"PURPOSE
The aim was to describe and analyse the rehabilitation process of the geriatric stroke patient from two perspectives; the treatment goals expressed by the staff and the patient and the treatment interventions chosen by the physiotherapist and occupational therapist. A secondary aim was to test whether the process, treatment goals and interventions could be classified according to the International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities and Handicaps (ICIDH).


METHOD
Qualitative interviews were performed with patients and personnel; diaries were used to register treatment interventions. The 30 interviews were categorized according to the goals expressed by physiotherapists, occupational therapists, physicians and patients. The diaries (n = 22) were analysed to describe how treatment interventions were connected in time, at what levels (impairment, disability and handicap) the interventions were directed, and finally, whether certain decisions were made in order to change the rehabilitation process.


RESULTS
The patients talked more about attaining their pre-stroke status than about their goals. The therapists set goals according to functional level, whereas the doctors expressed themselves in general terms. Three patterns of rehabilitation processes were found: one with clearly identified decision points, one with a set programme which was not changed through the process, and one where the goal was changed according to changes in medical status.


CONCLUSIONS
The patient does not participate in the goal-setting process, and the vaguely expressed goals are not measurable. The rehabilitation process and reason for discharge demonstrate different patterns. Treatment interventions, if related to the ICIDH, give a clear picture of the process, though certain interventions do not fit in the classification.";-;-;-;hard_0
6264453;Purification of the opiate receptor from rat brain.;The opiate receptor was purified from a Triton-solubilized preparation of rat neural membranes by the use of affinity chromatography. The affinity gel was prepared by coupling 14-beta-bromoacetamidomorphine, a newly synthesized ligand, to omega-aminohexyl-Sepharose. After elution of the nonspecific proteins with 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), the receptor proteins were eluted with 1 microM levorphanol or etorphine. NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed three major proteins associated with the opiate receptor, having molecular weights of 43,000, 35,000, and 23,000.

2448374;Induction and characterization of minor histocompatibility antigens. Specific primary cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses in vitro.;"A definite cytotoxic activity was developed in a BALB/c (H-2d) anti-DBA/2 primary mixed leukocyte culture (MLC), which received interleukin 2 (IL-2) on day 3 of culture. This cytotoxic activity was minor histocompatibility antigens (MIHA)-specific at the stimulator level, and was not developed in a syngeneic (BALB/c anti-BALB/c) MLC. The addition of IL-2 on day 3 of culture was crucial; no or very weak cytotoxic activity was developed in MLC receiving IL-2 on day 0 or on both day 0 and day 3. Only appropriate MIHA-allogeneic tumor cells were lysed as the target of the cytotoxic activity. The cytotoxic activity seemed MIHA-specific also at the target level; it lysed tumor cells of DBA/2 mouse origin but not those of BALB/c (syngeneic) origin. Phenotypes of the cytotoxic effector cell were Thy-1+ Lyt-2+. We concluded from these results that MIHA-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) were generated in the MIHA-allogeneic primary MLC. In this newly developed system, we studied genetic and antigenic requirements for primary anti-MIHA CTL responses in vitro. We demonstrated; among spleen cells (SC) of seven B10 H-2-congenic strains only SC of B10.D2 strain whose major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (H-2d) was compatible with the responder MHC effectively stimulated responder BALB/c (H-2d) SC for an anti-MIHA (DBA-C57BL-common) CTL response. Similarly, only SC of two out of seven C x B recombinant inbred strains (C x B.H and C x B.D), which were compatible at the MHC with responder SC, activated responder BALB/c SC for the response. The possibility that cells responding to H-2 alloantigens suppressed the anti-MIHA response was ruled out. Additional experiments showed that compatibility at the H-2K-end or the H-2D-end of the MHC was sufficient for a definite anti-MIHA response. These provided formal evidence that primary anti-MIHA CTL responses in vitro were MHC-restricted at the stimulator level. We then showed that sonication-disrupted SC or Sephadex G-10 column-passed nonadherent SC failed to stimulate responder SC for a primary anti-MIHA CTL response, whereas G-10-passed nonadherent SC responded well to adherent stimulator cells. Further study demonstrated that Ia+ adherent cells were the most active cell type as stimulator. Finally, we confirmed that the primary anti-MIHA CTL responses to adherent stimulator cells was MHC-restricted.";-;antigen;-;hard_2
27458159;Tristetraprolin functions in cytoskeletal organization during mouse oocyte maturation.;Tristetraprolin (TTP), a member of TIS11 family containing CCCH tandem zinc finger, is one of the best characterized RNA-binding proteins. However, to date, the role of TTP in mammalian oocytes remains completely unknown. In the present study, we report the altered maturational progression and cytokinesis, upon specific knockdown of TTP in mouse oocytes. Furthermore, by confocal scanning, we observe the failure to form cortical actin cap during meiosis of TTP-depleted oocytes. Loss of TTP in oocytes also results in disruption of meiotic spindle morphology and chromosome alignment. In support of these findings, incidence of aneuploidy is accordingly increased when TTP is abated in oocytes. Our results suggest that TTP as a novel cytoskeletal regulator is required for spindle morphology/chromosome alignment and actin polymerization in oocytes.;-;zinc finger;-;hard_2

30366326;Efficiencies and mechanisms of chemical cleaning agents for nanofiltration membranes used in produced wastewater desalination.;"A spiral-wound nanofiltration (NF) membrane module harvested from a full-scale produced wastewater desalination plant was examined and cleaned to explore appropriate chemical cleaning protocols. Foulant identification and cleaning efficiency and mechanisms were investigated. For total foulants, the organic components, including anionic polyacrylamide (APAM) and crude oil, accounted for a weight percentage of 86.3%, while the remaining foulants constituted the inorganic fraction, including Na, Mg, Ca, Ba, Al, Fe and Si. Short-term cleaning experiments were designed to identify effective reagents that could be used for further evaluations of their cleaning efficiencies in long-term cleaning. For citric acid and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tetrasodium (EDTA-4Na), the long-term cleaning efficiencies were relatively slight or even negative, while said values varied with different surfactants. Dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride (DTAC) achieved the greatest flux recovery; conversely, cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) provided insignificant, even negative effects, on flux recovery, as well as salt rejection, of the fouled NF membranes. FTIR and zeta potential analyses of the fouled membranes indicated that all the tested surfactants were identically effective in removing the foulants from the membrane surface, but their cleaning efficiencies differed. Moreover, a strong correlation between the flux ratio (Sf) and concentration of surfactant in the permeate (Cps) was observed. Among the tested chemical reagents, DTAC yielded the highest Cps and the greatest flux recovery, with an Sf of 2.25. Considering this correlation and the characteristics of the fouled membranes and surfactants, it is proposed that DTAC molecules penetrated the membrane pores and removed the foulants that were attached to the pore walls.";-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
30725534;Phylogenetic analysis of haemagglutinin gene deciphering a new genetically distinct lineage of canine distemper virus circulating among domestic dogs in India.;"Canine distemper (CD) is one of the highly contagious and invariably fatal viral diseases of dogs and other carnivores. Despite the widespread use of modified live vaccines to control CD, the prevalence of disease has increased at an alarming rate in recent years. Although a number of factors may be ascribed for vaccine failure, antigenic differences among the vaccine and wild-type strains have gained the interest of researchers. Considering the high genetic variability of haemagglutinin gene (H gene) and its role in eliciting the immune response to canine distemper virus (CDV), we have generated nine full-length CDV H gene sequences from infected dogs including three vaccinated cases. Bayesian analysis was performed using 102 full-length H gene nucleotide sequences over a time frame of 76 years (1940-2016) from 18 countries. The time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of CDV was estimated to be 1696 AD. Phylogenetic reconstruction clustered Indian wild-type viruses into a distinct monophyletic group clearly separated from the previously established CDV lineages. This signifies the presence of a novel genetic variant (proposed as ""Lineage India-1/Asia-5"") circulating among dog population in India. To investigate the importance of substitutions at amino acid residues 530 and 549 of CDV H protein in determining the host switches from canid to non-canid hosts, we analysed 125 H gene sequences including nine sequences generated in this study. Selection pressure analysis and analysis of amino acid sequences revealed a trend towards adaptation of 549H variants in non-canid hosts although no role of G/E530R/D/N substitution could be identified. This is the first comprehensive study about the nature and ecology of CDV circulating among dog population in India.

10896677;Hepatocyte nuclear factor-3 homologue 1 (HFH-1) represses transcription of smooth muscle-specific genes.;Results show that smooth muscle-specific promoters represent novel downstream targets of the winged helix factor hepatocyte nuclear factor-3 homologue 1 (HFH-1). HFH-1 strongly represses telokin promoter activity when overexpressed in A10 vascular smooth muscle cells. HFH-1 was also found to repress transcription of several other smooth muscle-specific promoters, including the SM22alpha promoter. HFH-1 inhibits telokin promoter activity, by binding to a forkhead consensus site located within an AT-rich region of the telokin promoter. The DNA-binding domain alone was sufficient to mediate inhibition, suggesting that binding of HFH-1 blocks the binding of other positive-acting factors. HFH-1 does not disrupt serum response factor binding to an adjacent CArG box within the telokin promoter, implying that HFH-1 must compete with other unidentified trans-activators to mediate repression. The localization of HFH-1 mRNA to the epithelial cell layer of mouse bladder and stomach implicates HFH-1 in repressing telokin expression in epithelial cells. This suggests that cell-specific expression of telokin is likely mediated by both positive-acting factors in smooth muscle cells and negative-acting factors in nonmuscle cell types. We propose a model in which the smooth muscle specificity of the telokin promoter is regulated by interactions between positive- and negative-acting members of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-3/forkhead family of transcription factors. ;threonine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

17142835;Peptides derived from the C2 domain of protein kinase C epsilon (epsilon PKC) modulate epsilon PKC activity and identify potential protein-protein interaction surfaces.;"Peptides derived from protein kinase C (PKC) modulate its activity by interfering with critical protein-protein interactions within PKC and between PKC and PKC-binding proteins (Souroujon, M. C., and Mochly-Rosen, D. (1998) Nat. Biotechnol. 16, 919-924). We previously demonstrated that the C2 domain of PKC plays a critical role in these interactions. By focusing on epsilonPKC and using a rational approach, we then identified one C2-derived peptide that acts as an isozyme-selective activator and another that acts as a selective inhibitor of epsilonPKC. These peptides were used to identify the role of epsilonPKC in protection from cardiac and brain ischemic damage, in prevention of complications from diabetes, in reducing pain, and in protecting transplanted hearts. The efficacy of these two peptides led us to search for additional C2-derived peptides with PKC-modulating activities. Here we report on the activity of a series of 5-9-residue peptides that are derived from regions that span the length of the C2 domain of epsilonPKC. These peptides were tested for their effect on PKC activity in cells in vivo and in an ex vivo model of acute ischemic heart disease. Most of the peptides acted as activators of PKC, and a few peptides acted as inhibitors. PKC-dependent myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate phosphorylation in epsilonPKC knock-out cells revealed that only a subset of the peptides were selective for epsilonPKC over other PKC isozymes. These epsilonPKC-selective peptides were also protective of the myocardium from ischemic injury, an epsilonPKC-dependent function (Liu, G. S., Cohen, M. V., Mochly-Rosen, D., and Downey, J. M. (1999) J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 31, 1937-1948), and caused selective translocation of epsilonPKC over other isozymes when injected systemically into mice. Examination of the structure of the C2 domain from epsilonPKC revealed that peptides with similar activities clustered into discrete regions within the domain. We propose that these regions represent surfaces of protein-protein interactions within epsilonPKC and/or between epsilonPKC and other partner proteins; some of these interactions are unique to epsilonPKC, and others are common to other PKC isozymes.";alanine;-;-;LCR_without_function
3063083;Structural and functional studies of protein kinase C.;It has now become clear that protein kinase C (PKC) plays a fundamental role in cellular growth control in higher eukaryotes. In addition, since PKC has also been shown to be the high-affinity intracellular receptor for several classes of tumor promoters, the study of PKC has also become a central focus of current work in cancer research. We have isolated cDNA clones encoding several forms of this enzyme, and we have used these clones to begin to study in detail the role of PKC in growth control and tumor promotion. The complete primary structure of one of these forms, designated PKC beta 1, exhibits structural and functional characteristics which are shared among all of the currently identified forms of PKC. These include an amino terminal cysteine-rich domain which mediates Ca2+ and phospholipid binding, tumor promoter binding, and membrane association, and a carboxy terminal catalytic domain which possesses serine/threonine protein kinase activity. To further characterize the function of PKC, we have generated a series of rat fibroblast cell lines which stably overexpress a full-length cDNA encoding the beta 1 form of this enzyme. These cell lines contain a 20- to 53-fold increase in PKC activity, and also have an increase in high affinity phorbol ester receptors, relative to control cells. They also exhibit dramatically enhanced morphologic changes in response to treatment with the tumor promoter 12-0-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA). These cell lines grow to a higher saturation density in monolayer culture and, when maintained at post-confluence, develop small, dense foci. In contrast to the control cells, which display complete anchorage dependence, the cell lines that overproduce PKC form small colonies in soft agar in the absence of TPA, and larger colonies in the presence of TPA. Thus, the mere overproduction of a single form of PKC is sufficient to confer anchorage independent growth and other growth abnormalities in rat fibroblasts. Taken together, these results provide direct evidence that PKC plays a critical role in normal cellular growth control and that it mediates several, and perhaps all of the cellular effects of the phorbol ester tumor promoters. ;cysteine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
8988535;S-Endo 1, a pan-endothelial monoclonal antibody recognizing a novel human endothelial antigen.;A murine monoclonal antibody (mAb) S-Endo 1 has been produced to detect circulating endothelial cells detached from blood vessels in pathological conditions. We have demonstrated that the associated-antigen (S-Endo 1 Ag) was highly expressed on human vascular structure irrespective of tissue origin or vessel caliber. Its expression was not restricted to endothelium, since it was also detected at low level on smooth muscle cells, stroma cells and follicular dendritic cells. But its absence on hematopoietic cells made S-Endo 1 a helpful reagent to specifically discriminate endothelium from hematopoietic tissues. Biochemical characterization showed that S-Endo 1 recognizes a monomeric structure of approximately 118 kDa on cultured endothelial cells. S-Endo 1 was submitted to the 5th International Workshop (Boston, 1993) and did not cluster in any of the old or new endothelial clusters discussed at the conference, indicating its unique reactivity. Together with the data presented in this paper, this suggested that S-Endo 1 defines a previously undescribed endothelial molecule.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
8659211;[Determining the degree of stenosis of peripheral arteries. Hemodynamic and ultrasound principles].;With colour duplex sonography, the identification and quantification of arterial stenoses in peripheral arteries had become feasible in reasonable time. However, the haemodynamic considerations are more complicated in peripheral arteries than in carotid arteries. This is attributable to the much longer vessel length, the influences of peripheral resistance, the frequency of multiple stenoses and combinations of occlusion and stenosis with multiple collateral vessels. Different qualitative and quantitative approaches are used: b-mode sonography, spectral analysis, velocity measurements, continuity equation and estimation of systolic pressure gradients (Bernoulli equation). Although standardized criteria in the grading of stenoses are not commonly used, the peak velocity ratio (PVR as a ratio of intra-and prestenotic velocity) seems to be mathematically founded, usefully versatile and reliable.;-;-;-;hard_0
7961416;Molecular cloning and characterization of outer membrane protein E of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis.;Outer membrane protein E (OMP E) is a 50-kDa protein of Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis. It is a potential vaccine antigen because it is expressed on the surface of the bacterium and has antigenic determinants which are conserved among most strains of M. catarrhalis. To clone the gene encoding OMP E, an EMBL-3 genomic library of strain 25240 was screened with a family of degenerate oligonucleotides based on the amino-terminal protein sequence. The OMP E gene was identified in one of the six positive clones by Southern blot analysis. An open reading frame of 1,377 bp encoding a protein of 460 amino acids was identified. The calculated molecular mass of the mature protein of 436 amino acid residues was 47.03 kDa, which correlated well with the results of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein product of the OMP E gene had a leader peptide of 25 amino acids and a signal peptidase 1 cleavage site similar to those of known OMPs of Escherichia coli. The transcription initiation site of the OMP E gene was mapped by primer extension to be 78 nucleotides upstream of the ATG start codon. Borderline homology was found to the FadL protein of E. coli (49.1% similarity and 25.6% identity), which is involved in the binding and transport of fatty acids. Analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the OMP E genes of 19 different strains of M. catarrhalis showed that the OMP E gene is highly conserved. The high degree of conservation of sequences of the OMP E genes of M. catarrhalis from diverse sources, along with earlier observations that the protein contains antigenic determinants on the bacterial surface, indicates that OMP E should be studied further as a potential vaccine antigen.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
5941782;Immunochemical studies on the antigenic determinants required to elicit delayed and immediate hypersensitivity reactions.;Hartley and strain 2 guinea pigs were sensitized to chemically defined alpha-DNP(Lys)(n)-BuAm, alpha-DNP(Lys)(n)-, and (Lys)(n)-BuAm peptides and skin tested with individual members of these homologous series, related peptides and hapten-substituted proteins. The immediate skin response (Arthus) could be elicited with hapten-substituted tetra-, penta-, or hexamers, whereas both immediate and delayed skin responses could be provoked by the octamer or nonamer. The hapten is an integral part of the determinant for both immediate and delayed skin reactivity, since poly-L-lysine was unable to elicit either delayed or immediate reactions in sensitized animals. Arthus type cross-reactions occurred only when the sensitizing and test antigen shared a common haptenic determinant. In contrast to this, in this system, delayed type cross-reactions occurred only when the test antigen and the sensitizing antigen contained both a large oligo-L-lysine carrier as well as the same haptenic determinant. These observations imply that the mediation of the delayed response requires a larger determinant than is necessary to elicit the immediate response. The role of high affinity antibody as the mediator of the delayed response is discussed in terms of the size of the antigenic determinants required to elicit this response. It was found that the ability to elicit the delayed response paralleled the immunogenic capacity of these peptides, whereas the immediate response could be elicited by nonimmunogenic peptides. This finding suggests that the delayed response may require the continued biosynthesis of antibody and may be analogous to a local in vivo secondary response.;-;antigen;poly-L-;hard_3
18631655;Protein synthesis in cells infected by Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (Ac-NPV): the effect of cytosine arabinoside.;"Twenty-two virion polypeptides (VP) were detected reproducibly when the occluded form (OV) of [35S]methionine-labeled Ac-NPV, purified from polyhedral inclusion bodies (PIB), was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Ten of the VPs and the polyhedral protein (PP) were phosphorylated and 6 VPs were glycoproteins. Purified, nonoccluded virus (NOV) revealed 25 polypeptides. During a single cycle of virus replication, the synthesis of 33 infected cell polypeptides (1CP) was detected in different relative proportions at different times. They were arbitrarily designated as early (0-12hr), middle (12-18 hr), and late 18-24 hr) polypeptides. Most of the middle and late proteins seemed to be viral structural proteins. Rapid post-translational cleavage of IPCs was not observed; however, pulse-chase experiments revealed post-translational modifications of at least four polypeptides. Inhibition of DNA synthesis at the time of infection did not prevent the synthesis of ICPs, VPs, or the formation of PIBs. Progeny PIB from both control and cytosine arabinoside (Ara C)-treated cells that were infected with radiochemically pure [3H]thymidine-labeled NOV contained parental virus DNA.

The RNA thus treated was intact and exhibited no signs of degradation as examined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in formamide. Assay for protein synthesis using a wheat germ cell-free system showed that the globin mRNA lacking m7G had lost most of its messenger activity. Identical treatment, of satellite tobacco necrosis virus (STNV) RNA, which does not contain the 5'-terminal ""CAP"" structure, resulted in no loss of its mRNA activity. Since the importance of the m7G residue in eukaryotic mRNA has not yet been shown essential for translation in vivo, both untreated and treated globin mRNAs were injected into frog oocytes and their translation into globin was measured at intervals over a ninety-six hour period.

The effect of the phenolic compounds protocatechuic acid, chlorogenic acid, tannic acid, gallates and silybin on ethoxyresorufin O-dealkylase (CYP1A1), methoxyresorufin O-dealkylase (CYP1A2) and pentoxy-O-dealkylase (CYP2B) was examined in mouse liver microsomes from induced animals. 2. All compounds tested could inhibit cytochrome P450-mediated enzyme activities, but to different extents. Tannic acid was the most potent inhibitor, especially toward EROD activity with an IC50=2.6 microM. Synthetic dodecyl gallate was also relatively selective toward this enzyme activity with an IC50=120 microM. 3. Protocatechuic acid, chlorogenic and silybin were more selective towards PROD and MROD activities. Their relative inhibitory potency for PROD activity was as follows: chlorogenic acid > protocatechuic acid > silybin > dodecyl gallate > propyl gallate. Protocatechuic acid was a more effective inhibitor of MROD activity than chlorogenic acid, and propyl gallate more effective than dodecyl gallate. Thus, no clear structure-activity or selectivity relationship was observed. 4.

1647141;Guinea pig model of transplacental congenital cytomegaloviral infection with analysis for labyrinthitis.;Cytomegalovirus is the most frequently recognized cause of congenital viral infection and of viral induced congenital hearing loss. Histopathologic reports on temporal bones from nine congenitally infected infants have most often demonstrated an endolabyrinthitis. The guinea pig and its specific cytomegaloviruses have been studied extensively as a model of transplacentally acquired infection. However, to date no investigation has been performed on the inner ear of such congenitally infected animals. To determine if a congenital viral labyrinthitis occurs in these guinea pigs, a study was conducted in which pregnant Hartley and Strain 2 guinea pigs were injected intraperitoneally with virulent salivary gland passaged cytomegalovirus during the first, second, or third trimester. Various durations of gestation up to delivery were permitted and selected organs from the products were then studied with routine histologic and immunocytochemical methods and cell cultures to verify the presence of transplacental infection. The temporal bones were studied with routine histopathology as well as immunocytochemical methods to detect cytomegalovirus antigen. Over 190 products of conception studied in this fashion revealed no evidence of teratogenesis or labyrinthine infection. It is not clear why in the presence of viremia, which resulted in cytomegalovirus infection of multiple organs, the inner ears of these animals were apparently spared.;-;antigen;-;hard_2

The two major components (gC and gA/gB) were purified free of other polypeptides and used to prepare specific antisera to these glycoproteins. Radioimmune precipitation demonstrated that these antisera were specific for the antigens used in their production. These two antisera as well as an anti-VP123 serum were further characterized by immunoprecipitation, neutralization, and membrane immunofluorescence techniques.

25494461;Effector-triggered immunity: from pathogen perception to robust defense.;In plant innate immunity, individual cells have the capacity to sense and respond to pathogen attack. Intracellular recognition mechanisms have evolved to intercept perturbations by pathogen virulence factors (effectors) early in host infection and convert it to rapid defense. One key to resistance success is a polymorphic family of intracellular nucleotide-binding/leucine-rich-repeat (NLR) receptors that detect effector interference in different parts of the cell. Effector-activated NLRs connect, in various ways, to a conserved basal resistance network in order to transcriptionally boost defense programs. Effector-triggered immunity displays remarkable robustness against pathogen disturbance, in part by employing compensatory mechanisms within the defense network. Also, the mobility of some NLRs and coordination of resistance pathways across cell compartments provides flexibility to fine-tune immune outputs. Furthermore, a number of NLRs function close to the nuclear chromatin by balancing actions of defense-repressing and defense-activating transcription factors to program cells dynamically for effective disease resistance.  ;-;transcription factor;-;hard_2
385643;Further observations on hippocampal neurons in dispersed cell culture.;"The growth of the processes of dissociated hippocampal neurons from 18- to 20-day-old rat fetuses has been studied in vitro using a method that permits cells to be maintained at relatively low plating densities for periods up to three weeks (Banker and Cowan, '77). Most of the cells are spherical or ovoid when they first attach to the substratum (either polylysine or collagen) but within 24 to 48 hours they begin to put out processes, and by the end of the first week in culture a significant proportion (approximately 45%) come to resemble normal pyramidal cells with a more-or-less triangular shaped soma, a single dominant dendrite-like process emerging from the apex of the soma, and several ""basal dendrites"" arising from the opposite pole of the cell. Comparisons of the lengths of these dendrite-like processes with those of hippocampal cells in the brains of animals sacrificed on the fourth post-natal day and impregnated by a variant of the Golgi-Cox method, indicate that in some cases the rate of process formation in vitro approximates that in vivo and that the general form of the neurons is remarkably like that of immature pyramidal cells. After a week in culture a second type of process can be recognized. These tend to be finer than those we have identified as dendrites; they are relatively uniform in diameter, frequently give off branches at right angles, and in the electron microscope can be seen to form synapses upon the larger processes and cell somata. These axon-like processes differ from the axons of normal pyramidal cells in two important respects: (i) most commonly they arise from one of the dendritic processes, including, on occasion, the putative ""apical"" dendrites, and only rarely from the base of the perikaryon; (ii) there may be two or more such processes from a single cell. The thicker, tapering processes can be shown (after incubation in 3H-uridine) to contain large amounts of RNA; newly-synthesized RNA does not extend into the finer, axon-like processes.";lysine;-;-;LCR_without_function
6327770;Functional and phenotypic comparison of human T cell leukemia/lymphoma virus positive adult T cell leukemia with human T cell leukemia/lymphoma virus negative Sézary leukemia, and their distinction using anti-Tac. Monoclonal antibody identifying the human receptor for T cell growth factor.;Adult T cell leukemia (ATL) and Sézary leukemia are malignant proliferations of T lymphocytes that share similar cell morphology and clinical features. ATL is associated with HTLV (human T cell leukemia/lymphoma virus), a unique human type C retrovirus, whereas most patients with the Sézary syndrome do not have antibodies to this virus. Leukemic cells of both groups were of the T3, T4-positive, T8-negative phenotype. Despite the similar phenotype, HTLV-negative Sézary leukemic cells frequently functioned as helper cells, whereas some HTLV-positive ATL and HTLV-positive Sézary cells appeared to function as suppressors of immunoglobulin synthesis. One can distinguish the HTLV-positive from the HTLV-negative leukemias using a monoclonal antibody (anti-Tac) that appears to identify the human receptor for T cell growth factor (TCGF). Resting normal T cells and most HTLV-negative Sézary cells were Tac-negative, whereas all ATL cell populations were Tac-positive. The observation that ATL cells manifest TCGF receptors suggests the possibility that an abnormality of the TCGF-TCGF receptor system may partially explain the uncontrolled growth of these cells.;-;-;-;hard_0
27849575;Mg2+ regulates transcription of mgtA in Salmonella Typhimurium via translation of proline codons during synthesis of the MgtL peptide.;"In Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Mg2+ limitation induces transcription of the mgtA Mg2+ transport gene, but the mechanism involved is unclear. The 5' leader of the mgtA mRNA contains a 17-codon, proline-rich ORF, mgtL, whose translation regulates the transcription of mgtA [Park S-Y et al. (2010) Cell 142:737-748]. Rapid translation of mgtL promotes formation of a secondary structure in the mgtA mRNA that permits termination of transcription by the Rho protein upstream of mgtA, whereas slow or incomplete translation of mgtL generates a different structure that blocks termination. We identified the following mutations that conferred high-level transcription of mgtA at high [Mg2+]: (i) a base-pair change that introduced an additional proline codon into mgtL, generating three consecutive proline codons; (ii) lesions in rpmA and rpmE, which encode ribosomal proteins L27 and L31, respectively; (iii) deletion of efp, which encodes elongation factor EF-P that assists the translation of proline codons; and (iv) a heat-sensitive mutation in trmD, whose product catalyzes the m1G37 methylation of tRNAPro Furthermore, substitution of three of the four proline codons in mgtL rendered mgtA uninducible. We hypothesize that the proline codons present an impediment to the translation of mgtL, which can be alleviated by high [Mg2+] exerted on component(s) of the translation machinery, such as EF-P, TrmD, or a ribosomal factor. Inadequate [Mg2+] precludes this alleviation, making mgtL translation inefficient and thereby permitting mgtA transcription. These findings are a significant step toward defining the target of Mg2+ in the regulation of mgtA transcription.";proline;-;-;LCR_without_function

These poorly known arboreal and mostly nocturnal generalist predators are widely distributed in lowland rainforests throughout the entire Amazon region, where they represent an important cause of snakebites. The three B. bilineatus spp. venom samples exhibit overall conserved proteomic profiles comprising components belonging to 11 venom protein classes, with PIII (34-40% of the total venom proteins) and PI (8-18%) SVMPs and their endogenous tripeptide inhibitors (SVMPi, 8-10%); bradykinin-potentiating-like peptides (BBPs, 10.7-15%); snake venom serine proteinases (SVSP, 5.5-14%); C-type lectin-like proteins (CTL, 3-10%); phospholipases A2 (PLA2, 2.8-7.6%); cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISP, 0.9-2.8%); l-amino acid oxidases (LAO, 0.9-5%) representing the major components of their common venom proteomes. Comparative analysis of the venom proteomes of the two geographic variants of B. b. smaragdinus with that of B. b. bilineatus revealed that the two Brazilian taxa share identical molecules between themselves but not with Peruvian B. b. smaragdinus, suggesting hybridization between the geographically close, possibly sympatric, Porto Velho (RO, BR) B. b. smaragdinus and B. b. bilineatus parental populations. However, limited sampling does not allow determining the frequency of this event. The toxin arsenal of the South American palm pit vipers may account for the in vitro recorded collagenolytic, caseinolytic, PLA2, l-amino acid oxidase, thrombin-like and factor X-activating activities, and the clinical features of South American palm pit viper envenomings, i.e., local and progressively ascending pain, shock and loss of consciousness, spontaneous bleeding, and profound coagulopathy. The remarkable cross-reactivity of the Brazilian pentabothropic SAB antivenom toward the heterologous B. b. bilineatus venom suggests that the paraspecific antigenic determinants should have been already present in the venom of the last common ancestor of the Bothrops ″jararaca″ and ″taeniatus″ clades, about 8.5 Mya in the mid-late Miocene epoch of the Cenozoic era.

8350414;Functional analysis of interactions between Tat and the trans-activation response element of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in cells.;Transcriptional trans-activation of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat requires that the virally encoded Tat effector interacts with its target trans-activation response element (TAR) RNA stem-loop. Although the arginine-rich region of Tat from amino acids 49 to 59 is sufficient to bind to TAR RNA in vitro, the RNA-binding domain of Tat has not been defined in vivo. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 also encodes the Rev protein, which acts through an RNA stem-loop called the Rev-response element to transport unspliced and singly spliced viral RNA species from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. To map the RNA-binding domain of Tat, we performed assays that relied on Rev function using the heterologous RNA-tethering mechanism of Tat and the TAR. By examining the effects of selected targeted mutations of Tat on the abilities of hybrid Tat/Rev proteins to rescue the expression of unspliced mRNA via the TAR, we demonstrated that residues throughout the N-terminal 59 amino acids of Tat are required for binding of Tat and TAR RNA in vivo. ;arginine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

Using polyclonal antibodies directed against mouse glycophorin (alpha gp), we have identified a glycoprotein antigenically related to glycophorin on the surface of bovine and rat cultured endothelial cells. Immunoblotting with alpha gp identified a single 60-kDa polypeptide on transfers of SDS/polyacrylamide gels of solubilized confluent endothelial monolayers. In addition, a 60-kDa polypeptide was immunoprecipitated by alpha gp from lysates of 125I-labeled intact endothelial cells. Controls with preimmune serum were negative. This antibody interaction was inhibited by murine erythrocyte ghosts and purified glycophorins. Our past work identified several endothelial surface sialoglycoproteins including a 60-kDa glycoprotein (gp60) that (i) interacts with albumin, (ii) binds Limax flavus, Ricinus communis, and Triticum vulgare agglutinins but not other lectins, (iii) is sequentially precipitated from 125I-labeled cell lysates by using R. communis agglutinin followed by T. vulgare agglutinin, and (iv) is sensitive to sialidase digestion. Immunoblotting of such precipitates with alpha gp demonstrates that lectins recognize the same glycoprotein, namely gp60.

Small (intranuclear size) peroxidase deposits were placed in hypothalamic nuclei by iontophoresis of a tracer solution containing poly-L-alpha-ornithine which greatly limited diffusion. The medial, central and amygdalo-hippocampal nuclei of the amygdala were found to be the major donors of amygdaloid afferent fibers to the hypothalamus, but there was also substantial labeling of somata in cortical, basomedial, basolateral and lateral amygdaloid nuclei and the intra-amygdaloid bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. No fibers projected from the posterior cortical nucleus of the amygdala to the hypothalamus. Most amygdaloid projections to the lateral hypothalamic area originated in the anterior half of the amygdala, while projections to the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus arose along the entire length of the amygdala except the posterior cortical nucleus. The amygdalo-hippocampal area projects to the medial hypothalamus. Other amygdaloid nuclei project to both the medial and lateral hypothalamic nuclei.

However, little is known about either its nuclear localization or its ligand(s), respectively. We demonstrate directly here that galectin-3 is associated with the RNA protein skeleton of the nucleus, i.e., the nuclear matrix, and binds with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and with RNA. The affinity of binding was determined to be 2.3 microM. Lactose, which inhibits galectin-3 binding to glycoconjugates, failed to inhibit either galectin-3-ssDNA or galectin-3-RNA binding.

1726525;Transglutaminase stabilizes melanoma adhesion under laminar flow.;To resist substantial wall shear stress (WSS) exerted by flowing blood, metastatic melanoma cells can form adhesive contacts with subendothelial extracellular matrix proteins, such as fibronectin (FN). Such contacts may be stabilized by transglutaminase catalyzed-cross-linkage of cell focal adhesion proteins. We analyzed human melanoma cell adhesion under flow by decreasing the flow (WSS) of melanoma cell suspensions and allowing them to adhere to immobilized wheat germ agglutinin or FN. At the wall shear adhesion threshold (WSAT), cell adherence was rapid with no rolling. Following cell adherence, we increased the flow and determined the wall shear detachment threshold (WSDeT). Cells spread and remained adherent on immobilized FN at high WSDeTs (greater than or equal to 32.5 dynes/cm2). The high resistance of adherent cells to shear forces suggested that transglutaminase-mediated crosslinking might be involved. Transglutaminase inhibitors monodansylcadaverine and INO-3178 decreased WSAT, and at low concentrations completely inhibited tumor cell spreading and promoted detachment at low WSDeTs (0.67 dynes/cm2). In static adhesion assays, transglutaminase inhibitors decreased cell adhesion to immobilized-FN in a dose-dependent manner and prevented the formation of crosslinked 125I-FN complex that failed to enter a SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel. The data suggest that transglutaminase-catalyzed crosslinking, particularly in the presence of WSS, may be important in stabilizing cellular adhesive contacts during adhesion to immobilized-FN.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
1881249;NMR imaging study of the pharmacodynamics of polylysine-gadolinium-DTPA in the rabbit and the rat.;"The pharmacodynamics of polylysine-(Gd-DTPA) (Schering, Berlin, Germany), a new blood pooling contrast agent for MRI, were studied in the rabbit and the rat. Polylysine-(Gd-DTPA) is a compound with high LD50. Due to its high molecular weight (50.000) and physico-chemical properties, it remains in the vascular system; during the first hour, the plasma level is three times higher than for Gd-DTPA. MRI was performed at 1.5 T using a SE sequence with TR/TE = 300/15 or 20 msec. Signal intensities of muscle, liver and kidney were measured before and after intravenous injection of the contrast agent (0.1 mmol/kg) during 8 hours in the rat (n = 3) and up to 2 wk in the rabbit (n = 3). A dose response study in three additional rabbits confirmed that the 0.1 mmol/kg dose was optimal. The pharmacodynamics results show that the effects of polylysine-(Gd-DTPA) are similar in both the rabbit and the rat. The liver signal is enhanced by about 60% immediately after injection in both species. This enhanced signal decays to half its maximal value in about one hour, which makes the contrast agent useful for clinical applications at a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg.

9774338;Pyk2 and Src-family protein-tyrosine kinases compensate for the loss of FAK in fibronectin-stimulated signaling events but Pyk2 does not fully function to enhance FAK- cell migration.;The focal adhesion kinase (FAK) protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) links transmembrane integrin receptors to intracellular signaling pathways. We show that expression of the FAK-related PTK, Pyk2, is elevated in fibroblasts isolated from murine fak-/- embryos (FAK-) compared with cells from fak+/+ embryos (FAK+). Pyk2 was localized to perinuclear regions in both FAK+ and FAK- cells. Pyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation was enhanced by fibronectin (FN) stimulation of FAK- but not FAK+ cells. Increased Pyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation paralleled the time-course of Grb2 binding to Shc and activation of ERK2 in FAK- cells. Pyk2 in vitro autophosphorylation activity was not enhanced by FN plating of FAK- cells. However, Pyk2 associated with active Src-family PTKs after FN but not poly-L-lysine replating of the FAK- cells. Overexpression of both wild-type (WT) and kinase-inactive (Ala457), but not the autophosphorylation site mutant (Phe402) Pyk2, enhanced endogenous FN-stimulated c-Src in vitro kinase activity in FAK- cells, but only WT Pyk2 overexpression enhanced FN-stimulated activation of co-transfected ERK2. Interestingly, Pyk2 overexpression only weakly augmented FAK- cell migration to FN whereas transient FAK expression promoted FAK- cell migration to FN efficiently compared with FAK+ cells. Significantly, repression of endogenous Src-family PTK activity by p50(csk) overexpression inhibited FN-stimulated cell spreading, Pyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation, Grb2 binding to Shc, and ERK2 activation in the FAK- but not in FAK+ cells. These studies show that Pyk2 and Src-family PTKs combine to promote FN-stimulated signaling events to ERK2 in the absence of FAK, but that these signaling events are not sufficient to overcome the FAK- cell migration defects.;-;kinase activity;poly-L-;hard_3
1982405;Sequencing and characterization of the 185 kDa cell surface antigen of Streptococcus mutans.;The gene spa P (formerly designated as spa P1) encoding the Mr 185,000 surface antigen I/II of Streptococcus mutans, serotype c (strain NG5) has been sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of antigen I/II (1561 residues) includes a putative signal peptide (residues 1-38), as well as a transmembrane region (residues 1537-1556). The N-terminal part of the protein (residues 39-550) is particularly rich in alanine and includes three tandem repeats of a sequence of 82 residues. This region is predicted to be alpha-helical, adopting a coiled-coil formation, and may account for the cell surface hydrophobicity associated with expression of antigen I/II. In contrast the C-terminal region (residues 800-1549) is proline-rich, favouring an extended conformation. Comparison with the sequence determined from Strep. mutans strain MT8148 showed that antigen I/II is highly conserved with the exception of a short central region (residues 750-805). N-terminal sequencing of purified antigens I and II components indicated that antigen I extends from the amino-terminus of the intact Mr 185,000 surface antigen while antigen II extends from residue 996.;proline;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
9073304;Regulation of oxidative and glycogenolytic ATP synthesis in exercising rat skeletal muscle studied by 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy.;"31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements of pH and the concentrations of orthophosphate and phosphocreatine were used to estimate rates of glycogenolytic and oxidative ATP synthesis in rat leg muscle during 6 min sciatic nerve stimulation at different rates (1-4 Hz). To study the regulation of glycogenolysis during exercise, the apparent 'glycogenolytic capacity' (L(MAX)) was calculated from glycogenolytic ATP synthesis rate and orthophosphate concentration as a measure of the Ca2+-dependent activation of glycogen phosphorylase. This was found to be proportional to the total ATP synthesis rate (F), and to decline with time; expressed relative to total ATP turnover rate as L(MAX)/F, its initial value was 2.9+/-0.6, declining with half-time 1.4+/-0.4 min. The apparent 'mitochondrial capacity' (Q(MAX)), calculated from oxidative ATP synthesis rate and [ADP], was independent of ATP turnover rate, but increased with half-time 0.8+/-0.1 min to 29+/-2 mmol kg(-1) min(-1): thus [ADP] was the predominant but not the only influence on oxidative ATP synthesis. Numerical simulation shows that time-dependent changes in L(MAX)/F exert a strong influence on pH and on the concentrations of phosphocreatine and ADP.";-;-;-;hard_0
8862398;Secondary structure model of the coat protein gene of turnip yellow mosaic virus RNA: long, C-rich, single-stranded regions.;The RNA of all tymoviruses, a group of ssRNA plant viruses, has a base composition that is different from that of most other viruses. The excess of cytosines (35-42%) and the low number of guanosines (15-17%) must impel an RNA structure with a relatively low amount of base pairing and a high incidence of unpaired cytosines. These unpaired cytosines probably function in RNA-protein interactions. To gain Insight into the way the RNA is positioned inside the virion, the secondary structure has been determined of a part of TYMV RNA, including the so-called tymobox, the coat protein gene, and the 3' untranslated region, by structure probing, sequence comparison, and computer predictions. Conservation of secondary structure elements in tymoviruses is not high and does not parallel the conservation of the primary structure. A combination of structure prediction and probing experiments, however, results in a model consisting of structured domains of 100-200 nucleotides interspersed by long unpaired cytosine-rich regions. The latter may interact with the coat protein inside the virion. The structure of some functionally interesting regions of the 3' part of TYMV RNA is also discussed.;cysteine;-;-;LCR_without_function
1328205;Kinetic model of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor tyrosine kinase and a possible mechanism of its activation by EGF.;"The tyrosine kinase activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR-TK) was determined at varying poly-Glu6Ala3Tyr1 (GAT) or [Val5]-angiotensin II (AT) and constant ATP concentrations and vice versa. With GAT as substrate, double reciprocal plots intersected practically on the abscissa following EGFR-TK pre-activation with EGF, but below the abscissa without EGF pre-activation. The EGFR-TK inhibitors App(NH)p (5'-adenylyl-beta, gamma-imidodiphosphate) and ADP were competitive with ATP and noncompetitive with GAT. Four families of 1/v vs. 1/[ATP] plots, constructed at different fixed concentrations of ADP and a different constant concentration of GAT for each family, yielded Slope1/ATP replots which intersected to the left of the ordinate and below the abscissa. GAT and AT, as cosubstrates, were competitive with each other and noncompetitive with ATP; 1/v vs. 1/[GAT] or 1/[AT] plots were hyperbolic and reached horizontal asymptotes when v was expressed as the rate of common product formation. All data were subjected to computer best-fit analysis by a program written especially for this purpose. We conclude that (i) the EGFR-TK reaction follows a Sequential Bi-Bi Rapid Equilibrium Random mechanism, and (ii) EGF induces conformational changes in the EGFR-TK active center which lead to marked decreases in the apparent dissociation constants of both substrates of the kinase reaction and a concomitant increase in initial velocities and Vmax (apparent).";glutamine;kinase activity;-;LCR_with_function
7066331;[Multiple molecular forms of human plasma butyrylcholinesterase. II.-Study of the C1, C3 and C4 components by means of affinity electrophoresis (author's transl)].;Affinity electrophoresis has been applied to the analysis of the multiple molecular forms of human plasma cholinesterase allozyme U. A water-soluble p-amino-substituted-phenyltrimethylammonium polyacrylamide was synthetized by copolymerization of an unsaturated derivative of the ligand with acrylamide, and entrapped at various concentrations within the matrix of separating gels. Electrophoresis was carried out in these gels, and the relative mobility of the molecular forms of the enzyme was decreased. From the variation of mobility (Rm) as a function of immobilized ligand concentrations, the apparent dissociation constants of monomer (C1), dimer (C3) and tetramer (C4) of phenotype U were calculated. The decrease in mobility was reversed by addition of non-immobilized competitive ligands (N-methylpyridinium and N-methylacridinium). The appearance of the slopes of Rmi-1 vs. concentration does not give sufficient information for determination of the number of anionic binding sites of C4, but the slight curvature of the plots suggests that bivalent or higher interactions occur when the concentration is sufficiently high. For all three size isomers from a critical ligand concentration, a second zone, named B, appears and intensifies rapidly at the expense of the first zone (A) as the immobilized ligand concentration increases. Among several possible explanations of this phenomenon, it is proposed that the ligand induces a conformational isomerization of the enzymes with a change in affinity (KD,B less than KD,A) and that the interconversion process between the two states B in equilibrium A is slow compared with the ligand-association equilibrium dissociation steps.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
1659796;Hepatitis C virus.;HepCV is the major cause of NANB PT hepatitis and is also implicated as the cause in a large proportion of sporadic cases of NANBH. Chronic infection with HepCV has also been linked to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Chimpanzees and marmosets are the only animals found to be experimentally infectable and the virus has not been propagated in any cell culture system. HepCV is an enveloped virus with a diameter of 30-60 nm and a 10-kb positive-stranded RNA genome. Its genome organization resembles that of the flaviviruses and pestiviruses. A 5'-untranslated segment of 341 nucleotides precedes a continuous ORF of 9030/9033 nucleotides which is followed by a 54 nucleotides long 3'-non-coding segment. Further work is required to resolve the question of whether the genomic RNA possesses a 3'-poly(U) or poly(A) tail. The genome also carries an internal poly(A) segment towards the 5'-end of its ORF. Genomic RNA is probably translated into a single polyprotein of 3010/3011 amino acids which is processed into functional proteins. The viral proteins have not been identified, but on the basis of the predicted amino acid sequences, hydrophobicity plots, location of potential glycosylation sites and similarities of these properties to those of pesti- and flaviviruses, the following genome organization has been predicted. The predicted viral structural proteins, a nucleocapsid protein and two envelope glycoproteins are located at the amino-terminal end of the polyprotein. They are followed by a highly hydrophobic protein and proteins that exhibit proteinase, helicase and replicase domains and thus are probably involved in RNA replication and protein processing. The replicase domain is located close to the carboxy terminus of the polyprotein. Although the overall nucleotide and amino acid homologies between HepCV and pestiviruses are low, a number of similarities exist that point to a closer ancestral relationship to the latter than the flaviviruses. First, the 5'-untranslated segment of the HepCV genome resembles that of the pestivirus genomes in size and presence of several short ORFs and it contains several segments with high nucleotide homology. Second, the two putative envelope glycoproteins of HepCV resemble two of the three putative envelope glycoproteins of the pestiviruses. Because its genome organization and predicted virion structure closely resemble those of the flaviviruses and pestiviruses, HepCV has been proposed to be placed in the family Flaviviridae.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS);alanine;-;-;LCR_without_function

36038242;Rapid magneto-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for ultrasensitive protein detection.;Protein-based diagnostics are the standard of care for screening and diagnosing a broad range of diseases and medical conditions. The current gold standard method for quantifying proteins in clinical specimens is the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which offers high analytical sensitivity, can process many samples at once, and is widely available in many diagnostic laboratories worldwide. However, running an ELISA is cumbersome, requiring multiple liquid handling and washing steps, and time-intensive (∼2 - 4 h per test). Here, we demonstrate a unique magneto-ELISA that utilizes dually labeled magnetic nanoparticles (DMPs) coated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and an HRP-conjugated detection antibody, enabling rapid immunomagnetic enrichment and signal amplification. For proof of concept, this assay was used to detect Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2), a malaria parasite biomarker, which exhibited a lower limit of detection of 2 pg mL-1 (33 fM) in human serum. Measurements of PfHRP2 in clinical blood samples from individuals with and without P. falciparum infection revealed that this magneto-ELISA offers a superior diagnostic accuracy compared to a commercial PfHRP2 ELISA kit. We also demonstrate the versatility of this platform by adapting it for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, which could be detected at concentrations as low as 8 pg mL-1 (174 fM) in human serum. In addition to its high analytical performance, this assay can be completed in 30 min, requires no specialized equipment, and is compatible with standard microplate readers and ELISA protocols, allowing it to integrate readily into current clinical practice.;histidine;-;-;LCR_without_function
17687326;Global changes to the ubiquitin system in Huntington's disease.;Huntington's disease (HD) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of CAG triplet repeats in the huntingtin (HTT) gene (also called HD) and characterized by accumulation of aggregated fragments of polyglutamine-expanded HTT protein in affected neurons. Abnormal enrichment of HD inclusion bodies with ubiquitin, a diagnostic characteristic of HD and many other neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, has suggested that dysfunction in ubiquitin metabolism may contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases. Because modification of proteins with polyubiquitin chains regulates many essential cellular processes including protein degradation, cell cycle, transcription, DNA repair and membrane trafficking, disrupted ubiquitin signalling is likely to have broad consequences for neuronal function and survival. Although ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation is impaired in cell-culture models of HD and of other neurodegenerative diseases, it has not been possible to evaluate the function of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in HD patients or in animal models of the disease, and a functional role for UPS impairment in neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis remains controversial. Here we exploit a mass-spectrometry-based method to quantify polyubiquitin chains and demonstrate that the abundance of these chains is a faithful endogenous biomarker of UPS function. Lys 48-linked polyubiquitin chains accumulate early in pathogenesis in brains from the R6/2 transgenic mouse model of HD, from a knock-in model of HD and from human HD patients, establishing that UPS dysfunction is a consistent feature of HD pathology. Lys 63- and Lys 11-linked polyubiquitin chains, which are not typically associated with proteasomal targeting, also accumulate in the R6/2 mouse brain. Thus, HD is linked to global changes in the ubiquitin system to a much greater extent than previously recognized.;glutamine;-;-;LCR_without_function
6509030;Purification and characterization of a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase from rat brain.;"A soluble Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase has been purified from rat brain to near homogeneity by using casein as substrate. The enzyme was purified by using hydroxylapatite adsorption chromatography, phosphocellulose ion-exchange chromatography, Sepharose 6B gel filtration, affinity chromatography using calmodulin-Sepharose 4B, and ammonium sulfate precipitation. On sodium dodecyl sulfate (NaDodSO4)-polyacrylamide gels, the purified enzyme consists of three protein bands: a single polypeptide of 51 000 daltons and a doublet of 60 000 daltons. Measurements of the Stokes radius by gel filtration (81.3 +/- 3.7 A) and the sedimentation coefficient by sucrose density sedimentation (13.7 +/- 0.7 S) were used to calculate a native molecular mass of 460 000 +/- 29 000 daltons. The kinase autophosphorylated both the 51 000-dalton polypeptide and the 60 000-dalton doublet, resulting in a decreased mobility in NaDodSO4 gels. Comparison of the phosphopeptides produced by partial proteolysis of autophosphorylated enzyme reveals substantial similarities between subunits. These patterns, however, suggest that the 51 000-dalton subunit is not a proteolytic fragment of the 60 000-dalton doublet. Purified Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent casein kinase activity was dependent upon Ca2+, calmodulin, and ATP X Mg2+ or ATP X Mn2+ when measured under saturating casein concentrations. Co2+, Mn2+, and La3+ could substitute for Ca2+ in the presence of Mg2+ and saturating calmodulin concentrations. In addition to casein, the purified enzyme displayed a broad substrate specificity which suggests that it may be a ""general"" protein kinase with the potential for mediating numerous processes in brain and possibly other tissues.";-;kinase activity;polyacrylamide;hard_3
34593858;A minimal model for gene expression dynamics of bacterial type II toxin-antitoxin systems.;Toxin-antitoxin (TA) modules are part of most bacteria's regulatory machinery for stress responses and general aspects of their physiology. Due to the interplay of a long-lived toxin with a short-lived antitoxin, TA modules have also become systems of interest for mathematical modelling. Here we resort to previous modelling efforts and extract from these a minimal model of type II TA system dynamics on a timescale of hours, which can be used to describe time courses derived from gene expression data of TA pairs. We show that this model provides a good quantitative description of TA dynamics for the 11 TA pairs under investigation here, while simpler models do not. Our study brings together aspects of Biophysics with its focus on mathematical modelling and Computational Systems Biology with its focus on the quantitative interpretation of 'omics' data. This mechanistic model serves as a generic transformation of time course information into kinetic parameters. The resulting parameter vector can, in turn, be mechanistically interpreted. We expect that TA pairs with similar mechanisms are characterized by similar vectors of kinetic parameters, allowing us to hypothesize on the mode of action for TA pairs still under discussion.;-;-;-;hard_0
10094393;CK2alpha loci in the human genome: structure and transcriptional activity.;Two CK2alpha loci are present in the human genome. First, locus 20p13, that contains the CK2alpha coding gene. It spans around 70 kb, is composed of 13 exons and shows homology to the respective gene in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The translation start site is located in the second exon, the stop codon in exon 13. Two transcription start sites were identified, the further 5' located site defines position 1 of the gene, the second site is located at position 50, respectively. The promoter region shows characteristics of a so-called house keeping gene: A high GC content, lack of a TATA-box and presence of several GC-boxes. By reporter gene assays, the promoter region of the CK2alpha gene could be located between position -256 and 144 relative to the first transcription start site. In the 3' noncoding region of the CK2alpha gene, six polyadenylation signals were identified. As indicated by Northern blot analysis and by comparison with expressed sequence tags from the EMBL databank, the most 3' located, active polyadenylation signal seems to be the fourth defining the end of the CK2alpha gene. The second CK2alpha locus is at 11p15. It contains a processed pseudogene, which shows all typical features of a processed sequence, such as absence of introns, short poly-A tail and direct flanking repeats. Interestingly, it contains a complete open reading frame and has potential promoter elements in its 5' region. Nevertheless, no promoter activity could be detected in reporter gene assays.;alanine;-;-;LCR_without_function
6098202;Oronasal and intramuscular vaccination of swine with a modified live porcine parvovirus vaccine: multiplication and transmission of the vaccine virus.;"An attenuated strain NADL-2 of porcine parvovirus (PPV) has been used at the 54th cell culture passage as a modified live-virus (MLV) vaccine. The present study was conducted to determine the minimum immunizing dose of MLV, the extent of MLV multiplication in swine tissues, and its transmission from swine administered MLV oronasally or intramuscularly. Immune response to MLV was dose dependent and swine responded to as little as 10(2) median cell-culture infective doses (CCID50). A 10(5) CCID50 of MLV, the largest dose given, induced the best immune response and was used in subsequent experiments. Route of MLV administration also was found to be important. The MLV replicated in tissues of swine after IM inoculation; however, viral antigen in tissues was less, as measured by immunofluorescence, and serum hemagglutination-inhibition titers for PPV were lower in MLV-inoculated swine than we have previously observed in virulent PPV-inoculated swine. In contrast, oronasal inoculation with MLV did not consistently result in infection of pigs; only 5 of 23 swine had virologic and/or serologic evidence of infection. Virus transmission studies indicated that MLV is shed in feces, but shedding occurs later than that in virulent-PPV-inoculated swine and is inconsistent. Delayed transmission of MLV was observed in contact pigs, which were seronegative at 2 weeks, but became seropositive at 4 weeks--indicating that perhaps a virus population capable of infecting pigs by oronasal route was selected by passage through the pig.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)";-;antigen;-;hard_2
8950596;S-100 protein subunits in bovine oviduct epithelium: in situ distribution and changes during primary cell culture.;Cultures of bovine oviduct epithelial cells are widely used in co-culture systems to improve the results of in vitro fertilization. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the suitability of S-100 protein as a differentiation marker for bovine oviduct epithelial cells in vitro. The distribution of S-100 alpha and S-100 beta was examined immunohistochemically in bovine oviduct epithelium in situ and in primary cell cultures derived from it. Three segments of the Fallopian tube (isthmus, ampulla and fimbriae) were compared and analysed during different stages of the oestrus cycle (luteal phase and follicular phase). Ciliated and non-ciliated cells of the epithelium reacted with anti-S-100 alpha, S-100a (alpha beta) and S-100 beta antibodies, except for isthmic non-ciliated cells, which did not bind anti-S-100 beta or anti-S-100a (alpha beta). In addition, basal cells never showed immunoreactivity for S-100. In confluent monolayers of cultured oviduct epithelial cells, disappearance of reactivity for S-100 paralleled morphological signs of dedifferentiation (loss of cilia, cytoplasmic vacuolization). Free-floating oviduct epithelial cells, in contrast, retained morphological differentiation and still expressed S-100 antigen even after seven days in vitro. The immunohistochemical findings were confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. The results indicate that the presence of S-100 is closely connected to morphological differentiation and to the specific functional condition of bovine oviduct epithelial cells.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
1737794;Secreted and cellular proteochondroitin sulfates of a human B lymphoblastoid cell line contain different protein cores.;Proteoglycans of the human B lymphoblastoid cell line LICR-LON-HMy2 were metabolically labeled with [35S]sulfate. High-density fractions of 35S-labeled material separated by CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation were further purified by anion exchange chromatography and gel filtration. Two proteoglycans, isolated from cell lysates and culture supernatants, were characterized by gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in combination with enzymatic degradation. Treatment with chondroitinase AC completely degraded the glycosaminoglycan moiety of the proteoglycans. Three to 4 chondroitin sulfate chains (average molecular mass = 26 kDa) were estimated for each of the two proteoglycans. Differences between the proteochondroitin sulfates (CSPG) were observed in the content of N-linked oligosaccharides. After chondroitinase AC treatment the resulting band in SDS-PAGE of the secreted CSPG was sensitive to treatment with endoglycosidase F (Endo F) which further reduced the molecular mass from 30 to 21.5 kDa, whereas the band of the cellular CSPG after chondroitinase AC treatment (molecular mass = 30 kDa) remained resistant to Endo F treatment. The composition of amino acids was different in the protein cores, suggesting differences in the primary structure. Both CSPG contained a high percentage of glycine and serine. For both CSPG a molecular mass of approximately 135 kDa was deduced from the hydrodynamic sizes of the glycosaminoglycan chains obtained after alkaline/borohydride treatment and the migration of the protein/oligosaccharide complexes in SDS-PAGE. 75% of all [35S]sulfate-labeled molecules were found in the culture supernatant and 25% in the cellular fraction. 35S-Labeled material in the culture supernatant consisted exclusively of intact CSPG, whereas 35S-Labeled molecules in the cellular preparation consisted largely of free chondroitin sulfate chains. Only 8.3% of the cellular material, isolated from the microsomal fraction, was intact CSPG. In pulse-chase experiments maximal secretion of CSPG was found after 4 h, comprising approximately 40% of totally synthesized CSPG. From these experiments we tentatively conclude that a small proportion of CSPG synthesized by LICR-LON-HMy2 cells is membrane-associated, a larger portion is secreted, and another portion is intracellularly degraded.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1

Sequence analysis of the cDNA revealed that the Dictyostelium MHCK possesses all of the domains characteristic of members of the protein kinase C family. The amino-terminal region of the MHCK contains the cysteine-rich motif with an internal duplication that is present in all known protein kinase C species. This domain precedes sequences that are highly homologous to protein kinase catalytic domains. The carboxyl-terminal region contains a cluster of 23 serine and threonine residues that may represent the autophosphorylation domain of the Dictyostelium MHCK. These results, along with previous studies that indicate that this enzyme has very restrictive substrate specificity, incorporates approximately 20 mol of phosphate per mol of kinase through an autophosphorylation reaction, and is expressed only during development, suggest that the Dictyostelium MHCK is a distinct member of the protein kinase C family and imply that this kinase family, which may include members with very specific cellular functions, may be even more heterogeneous than previously thought.;cysteine;-;-;LCR_without_function

The pretreatments also increased gill microsomal benzo[a]pyrene and 7-ethoxyresorufin oxidations. Immunoblot analysis of liver and gill microsomes revealed that 3-MC and PCBs induced a protein recognized by the mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb) 1-12-3 against scup P450 1A1. Northern analysis of liver and gill RNA showed that 3-MC and PCBs increased the intensity of 2.9-kb- and 1.5-kb-sized mRNA bands hybridizable to a trout P450 1A1 cDNA probe. Pretreatment with phenobarbital was without effects on the monooxygenase activity or protein or mRNA levels in liver and gill. A 3-MC-inducible P450 hemoprotein (M(r) = 59,000) and a NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase flavoprotein (M(r) = 74,000) were purified from liver microsomes. The tilapia P450 hemoprotein showed an absorption maximum at 447 nm in CO-difference spectrum and a strong immunoreactivity with MAb 1-12-3. A reconstituted tilapia monooxygenase system consisting of P450 and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase was effective in the catalysis of 7-ethoxyresorufin, benzo[a]pyrene, and 7-ethoxycoumarin oxidations, but not in N-nitrosodimethylamine demethylation.

12388589;A receptor for activated C kinase is part of messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes associated with polyA-mRNAs in neurons.;Long-lasting changes in synaptic functions after an appropriate stimulus require altered protein expression at the synapse. To restrict changes in protein composition to activated synapses, proteins may be synthesized locally as a result of transmitter receptor-triggered signaling pathways. Second messenger-controlled mechanisms that affect mRNA translation are essentially unknown. Here we report that a receptor for activated C kinase, RACK1, is a component of messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes. RACK1 is predominantly associated with polysome-bound, polyA-mRNAs that are being actively translated. We find it to be present in a complex with beta-tubulin and at least two mRNA-binding proteins, polyA-binding protein 1 and a 130 kDa polyA-mRNA binding protein (KIAA0217). Activation of PKCbeta2 in vitro by phosphatidylserine/diacylglycerol or in hippocampal slices by metabotropic glutamate receptor stimulation increased the amount of RACK1/PKCbeta2 associated with polysome-bound polyA-mRNAs. In vitro, PKCbeta2 can phosphorylate a subset of polyA-mRNA-associated proteins that are also phosphorylated under in vivo conditions. On the basis of these findings plus the somatodendritic localization of RACK1, we hypothesize that metabotropic glutamate receptor-triggered binding of activated PKCbeta2 to mRNP complexes bound to polyA-mRNAs is involved in activity-triggered control of protein synthesis. ;-;nucleic acid binding;-;hard_2
2026326;Pheromone-dependent phosphorylation of the yeast STE12 protein correlates with transcriptional activation.;Haploid a and alpha cells of yeast respond to the pheromones alpha- and a-factor, respectively, by increasing the transcription of many genes whose products are essential for mating. The STE12 protein acts in this process by binding to the DNA sequence that mediates the increased transcription of pheromone-responsive genes. We show here that a hybrid protein containing STE12 fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 can activate transcription of a reporter gene containing GAL4-binding sites but only after treatment of cells with pheromone. Thus, STE12 alone, when bound to DNA, is sufficient to mediate pheromone-induced transcription. By constructing hybrids of different STE12 regions with the GAL4 domain, we map the domain of STE12 necessary for this activation to the central third of the protein. Upon alpha-factor treatment, the hybrid of GAL4 with the complete STE12 sequence is rapidly phosphorylated, with kinetics consistent with the observed transcriptional induction of pheromone-responsive genes. The domain of STE12 necessary for this phosphorylation correlates with that involved in transcriptional activation. We propose that induction of pheromone-responsive genes is mediated by phosphorylation of STE12 to alter its activation function but not its DNA-binding ability.;-;nucleic acid binding;-;hard_2

It exhibited considerable charge heterogeneity during isoelectric focusing and was not affected by neuraminidase treatment, p75 was synthesized by thymus, spleen and lymph node cells, by antigen-stimulated T-cells from strain 13 and strain 2 guinea-pigs, and by guinea-pig B-cell L2C leukemia lines, but not by normal B-lymphocytes or macrophages. No differences between the isoelectric focusing patterns of p75 molecules isolated from different cell types could be demonstrated. The chemical properties of p75 and its expression by the cell types so far examined indicate that p75 is a possible candidate for the guinea-pig homologue of the murine Lyt-1 antigen.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
9765455;Role of variable regions A and B in receptor binding domain of amphotropic murine leukemia virus envelope protein.;For the amphotropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV), a 208-amino-acid amino-terminal fragment of the surface unit (SU) of the envelope glycoprotein is sufficient to bind to its receptor, Pit2. Within this binding domain, two hypervariable regions, VRA and VRB, have been proposed to be important for receptor recognition. In order to specifically locate residues that are important for the interaction with Pit2, we generated a number of site-specific mutations in both VRA and VRB and analyzed the resulting envelope proteins when expressed on retroviral vectors. Concurrently, we substituted portions of the amphotropic SU with homologous regions from the polytropic MuLV envelope protein. The amphotropic SU was unaffected by most of the point mutations we introduced. In addition, the deletion of eight residues in a region of VRA that was previously suggested to be essential for Pit2 utilization only decreased titer on NIH 3T3 cells by 1 order of magnitude. Although the replacement of the amino-terminal two-thirds of VRA with the polytropic sequence abolished receptor binding, smaller nonoverlapping substitutions did not affect the function of the protein. We were not able to identify a single critical receptor contact point within VRA, and we suggest that the amphotropic receptor binding domain probably makes multiple contacts with the receptor and that the loss of some of these contacts can be tolerated.;-;-;-;hard_0
27994033;Extreme mutation bias and high AT content in Plasmodium falciparum.;For reasons that remain unknown, the Plasmodium falciparum genome has an exceptionally high AT content compared to other Plasmodium species and eukaryotes in general - nearly 80% in coding regions and approaching 90% in non-coding regions. Here, we examine how this phenomenon relates to genome-wide patterns of de novo mutation. Mutation accumulation experiments were performed by sequential cloning of six P. falciparum isolates growing in human erythrocytes in vitro for 4 years, with 279 clones sampled for whole genome sequencing at different time points. Genome sequence analysis of these samples revealed a significant excess of G:C to A:T transitions compared to other types of nucleotide substitution, which would naturally cause AT content to equilibrate close to the level seen across the P. falciparum reference genome (80.6% AT). These data also uncover an extremely high rate of small indel mutation relative to other species, primarily associated with repetitive AT-rich sequences, in addition to larger-scale structural rearrangements focused in antigen-coding var genes. In conclusion, high AT content in P. falciparum is driven by a systematic mutational bias and ultimately leads to an unusual level of microstructural plasticity, raising the question of whether this contributes to adaptive evolution. ;threonine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
1738601;Expression of active iron regulatory factor from a full-length human cDNA by in vitro transcription/translation.;Iron regulatory factor (IRF), also called iron responsive element-binding protein (IRE-BP), is a cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein which regulates post-transcriptionally transferrin receptor mRNA stability and ferritin mRNA translation. By using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the sequence published by Rouault et al. (1990) a probe was derived which permitted the isolation of three human IRF cDNA clones. Hybridization to genomic DNA and mRNA, as well as sequencing data indicated a single copy gene of about 40 kb specifying a 4.0 kb mRNA that translates into a protein of 98,400 dalton. By in vitro transcription of a assembled IRF cDNA coupled to in vitro translation in a wheat germ extract, we obtained full sized IRF that bound specifically to a human ferritin IRE. In vitro translated IRF retained sensitivity to sulfhydryl oxidation by diamide and could be reactivated by beta-mercaptoethanol in the same way as native placental IRF. An IRF deletion mutant shortened by 132 amino acids at the COOH-terminus was no longer able to bind to an IRE, indicating that this region of the protein plays a role in RNA recognition. Placental IRF has previously been shown to migrate as a doublet on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After V8 protease digestion the heterogeneity was located in a 65/70 kDa NH2-terminal doublet. The liberated 31 kDa COOH-terminal polypeptide was found to be homogeneous by amino acid sequencing supporting the conclusion of a single IRF gene.;-;nucleic acid binding;polyacrylamide;hard_3

385948;Clinical trials in vaccination with leukemia associated antigens in acute myelogenous leukemia.;Vaccination with purified leukemia associated antigens (LAA) was performed in sixty adult patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) who were admitted to Medical City, Yermok Hospital, Alshaab Hospital, Altefelalarabie Hospital, Basrah Hospital, Mosul Hospital, Althawra Hospital and Samaon Hospital. LAA were prepared from leukemic cells, using hypotonic lysis and low frequency sonication, followed by discontinuous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or column chromatography. Five doses were given intradermally, after discontinuation of the maintenance therapy. Clinical and immunological studies were done prevaccination and used to evaluate the effect of this vaccine. The patients were randomized into two groups: one group included 32 patients who received LAA alone and the other group included 28 patients who received LAA with BCG-cell wall skeleton as an adjuvant. Control groups of patients were also randomized into two subgroups: one subgroup included 30 patients who did not receive any kind of immunotherapy, the other subgroup included 30 patients who received BCG-cell wall skeleton only. All the LAA vaccinated groups showed increased blastogenic response to LAA most pronounced on day 22 and afterwards. There was increased response to non-specific mitogens after vaccination, especially after the 63rd day. All the vaccinated groups showed increased skin reactivity to LAA after vaccination. Fifty-seven of these patients had an initial weak reaction but it became more marked after vaccination. There was a correlation between the blastogenic responses and skin test reactivity to the clinical course. All the nonvaccinated group and those who were given BCG-cell wall skeleton alone died within 9 weeks (range 7--11 weeks) after discontinued chemotherapy making the survival range from 23--40 weeks (median of 29 weeks), in contrast all the vaccinated groups who received LAA alone or in combination with three BCG-cell wall skeleton doses are in complete unmaintained remission ranging in survival from 58 weeks to 74 weeks (median value is 63 weeks).;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
30548564;Electronic and Steric Control of n→π* Interactions: Stabilization of the α-Helix Conformation without a Hydrogen Bond.;The preferred conformations of peptides and proteins are dependent on local interactions that bias the conformational ensemble. The n→π* interaction between consecutive carbonyls promotes compact conformations, including the α-helix and polyproline II helix. In order to further understand the n→π* interaction and to develop methods to promote defined conformational preferences through acyl N-capping motifs, a series of peptides was synthesized in which the electronic and steric properties of the acyl group were modified. Using NMR spectroscopy, van't Hoff analysis of enthalpies, X-ray crystallography, and computational investigations, we observed that more electron-rich donor carbonyls (pivaloyl, iso-butyryl, propionyl) promote stronger n→π* interactions and more compact conformations than acetyl or less electron-rich donor carbonyls (methoxyacetyl, fluoroacetyl, formyl). X-ray crystallography indicates a strong, electronically tunable preference for the α-helix conformation, as observed directly on the φ and ψ torsion angles. Electron-donating acyl groups promote the α-helical conformation, even in the absence of the hydrogen bonding that stabilizes the α-helix. In contrast, electron-withdrawing acyl groups led to more extended conformations. More sterically demanding groups can promote trans amide bonds independent of the electronic effect on n→π* interactions. Chloroacetyl groups additionally promote n→π* interactions through the interaction of the chlorine lone pair with the proximal carbonyl π*. These data provide additional support for an important role of n→π* interactions in the conformational ensemble of disordered or unfolded proteins. Moreover, this work suggests that readily incorporated acyl N-capping motifs that modulate n→π* interactions may be employed rationally to promote conformational biases in peptides, with potential applications in molecular design and medicinal chemistry. ;proline;helix;-;LCR_with_function
1720021;Effect of limited proteolysis in the 8th loop of the barrel and of antibodies on porcine pancreas amylase activity.;The porcine pancreatic alpha-amylase is a (beta/alpha)8-barrel protein, containing domains A and B (peptide sequence 1-403) and a distinct C-domain (peptide sequence 404-496). Separation of the terminal C-domain from the A and B domains has been attempted by limited proteolysis in the hinge region. Subtilisin was found to hydrolyse amylase between residues 369 and 370 situated in the loop between the eighth beta-strand and alpha-helix. The cleaved amylase was isolated by chromatofocusing and found to retain about 60% of the activity of the native enzyme, while the isolated fragments were inactive. Antigen binding fragments prepared from polyclonal antibodies to native amylase and the CNBr-fragment P1 (peptide sequence 395-496) respectively, were tested for influence on the enzyme activity. Antibodies directed against P1 had no effect whereas antibodies against the peptide sequence 1-394 and amylase respectively inhibited hydrolysis of substrates having four or more glucose residues but not of shorter oligomaltosides. Crystallographic analysis revealed that changes in the region of residue 369 might affect the conformation of the active site as well as of a second binding site. This site, located on the enzyme surface, is proposed to be required for the hydrolysis of larger substrates.;-;helix;-;hard_2
9686575;B lymphocytes are crucial antigen-presenting cells in the pathogenic autoimmune response to GAD65 antigen in nonobese diabetic mice.;Recent reports have shown that B cells play a key role in the pathogenesis of T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) in nonobese diabetic mice (NOD). We have investigated the role of B lymphocytes as APCs in the generation of autoreactive T cell responses by comparing spontaneous responses to self Ags in B cell-deficient and wild-type NOD mice. We determined that B cell-deficient mice had no spontaneous responses to 65-kDa glutamate decarboxylase (GAD65), its immunodominant peptides, and the 60-kDa heat shock protein. In contrast, these Ags are able to induce proliferative responses in the splenocyte cultures of B cell-positive NOD mice. However, T cells from B-deficient mice conserved the ability to respond to nonself Ags and mitogens. The Ag-presenting function of B cells was pivotal in the autoimmune response, since the proliferation of wild-type splenocytes to GAD65 was completely inhibited by blocking the surface Ig-mediated capture of the protein Ag by B cells. Responses to immunodominant GAD65 peptides were also absent in B cell-deficient NOD mice, suggesting that B cells are crucial with regard to the diversification of the autoimmune response to various self epitopes. We believe our results represent strong evidence that B cells are required as APCs to generate pathogenic autoimmune T cell responses and provide a direct correlation between the protection from autoimmune diabetes previously reported in B cell-deficient NOD mice and the lack of anti-GAD65 and anti-heat shock protein 60 T cell responses in these mice.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
34045100;Protective role of PhtD and its amino and carboxyl fragments against pneumococcal sepsis.;The implementation of polysaccharide-based vaccines has massively reduced the incidence of invasive pneumococcal diseases. However, there is great concern regarding serotype replacement and the increase in antibiotic resistant strains expressing non-vaccine capsular types. In addition, conjugate vaccines have high production costs, a limiting factor for their implementation in mass immunization programs in developing countries. These limitations have prompted the development of novel vaccine strategies for prevention of Streptococcus pneumoniae infections. The use of conserved pneumococcal antigens such as recombinant proteins or protein fragments presents an interesting serotype-independent alternative. Pht is a family of surface-exposed proteins which have been evaluated as potential vaccine candidates with encouraging results. The present work investigated the immune responses elicited by subcutaneous immunization of mice with the polyhistidine triad protein D (PhtD) and its amino and carboxyl terminal fragments. The proteins were immunogenic and protective against pneumococcal sepsis in mice. Antibodies raised against PhtD increased complement C3b deposition on the pneumococcal surface, mainly mediated by the alternative pathway. Sera from mice immunized with PhtD and PhtD_Cter promoted an increase in bacterial uptake by mouse phagocytes. The interaction of PhtD with the complement system regulator factor H was investigated in silico and in vitro by ELISA and western blot, confirming PhtD as a factor-H binding protein. Our results support the inclusion of PhtD and more specifically, its C-terminal fragment in a multicomponent serotype independent vaccine and suggests a role for the complement system in PhtD-mediated protection.;histidine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
6375523;Experiences with the ELISA for detection of the E. coli K99 antigen in calf faeces.;This paper summarizes experiences with the use of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of K99+ E. coli in calf faeces. ELISA results were compared with those of conventional bacteriological examination (BE) using a total of 1668 faecal samples of calves in the field, collected during aetiological and epidemiological studies. In addition, faecal samples obtained from four experimentally inoculated calves were examined with ELISA, BE and quantitative BE i.e. determination of the number of viable K99+ ETEC organisms per gram of faeces. The ELISA proved to be very useful, though slightly less sensitive than BE, when dealing with large numbers of faecal samples of calves of less than 6 days of age. Clinical ETEC-induced diarrhoea cases appeared to be diagnosed particularly reliably. In calves of over five days of age, however, positive BE-results were usually not confirmed by ELISA, most likely due to the presence of specific copro-antibodies. This last conclusion was suggested by the observation that in experimentally inoculated calves. ELISA results became negative abruptly after day 6 post-infection. The quantitative BE showed no significant decrease of the number of ETEC organisms at that time. In some faecal samples after day 6 post-infection an excess of K99 antibodies was demonstrated. It is concluded that ELISA is of no value in epidemiological studies on the spread and persistence of K99+ ETEC organisms in older calves and cows. However, ELISA is a very reliable diagnostic tool for use in large-scale field surveys on the aetiology of neonatal calf diarrhoea.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
11831893;Minor groove DNA binders as antimicrobial agents. 1. Pyrrole tetraamides are potent antibacterials against vancomycin resistant Enterococci [corrected] and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.;A new series of short pyrrole tetraamides are described whose submicromolar DNA binding affinity is an essential component for their strong antibacterial activity. This class of compounds is related to the linked bis-netropsins and bis-distamycins, but here, only one amino-pyrrole-carboxamide unit and an amidine tail is connected to either side of a central dicarboxylic acid linker. The highest degree of DNA binding, measured by compound-induced changes in UV melting temperatures of an AT-rich DNA oligomer, was observed for flat, aromatic linkers with no inherent bent, i.e., terephthalic acid or 1,4-pyridine-dicarboxylic acid. However, the antibacterial activity is critically linked to the size of the N-alkyl substiutent of the pyrrole unit. None of the tetraamides with the commonly used methyl-pyrrole showed antibacterial activity. Isoamyl- or cyclopropylmethylene-substituted dipyrrole derivatives have the minimum inhibitory concentrations in the submicromolar range. In vitro toxicity against human T-cells was studied for all compounds. The degree to which compounds inhibited cell growth was neither directly correlated to DNA binding affinity nor directly correlated to antibacterial activity but seemed to depend strongly on the nature of the N-alkyl pyrrole substituents. ;threonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

The role of nuclear factor-κB in cellular senescence is controversial, as it has been associated with both proliferation and tumour progression, and also with growth arrest and ageing.

9030575;Isolation and characterization of the 5'-upstream region of the human N-type calcium channel alpha1B subunit gene. Chromosomal localization and promoter analysis.;omega-Conotoxin-sensitive N-type Ca2+ channels, unlike dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type channels, are exclusively expressed in nervous tissues. To understand the molecular basis for neuron-specific expression of the N-type channel, we have isolated genomic clones encoding the human alpha1B subunit gene, localized to the long arm of chromosome 9 (9q34) by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and characterized its 5'-upstream region. The proximal promoter of the alpha1B subunit gene lacks a typical TATA box, is highly GC-rich, and contains several sequences for transcription factor binding. Primer extension experiments revealed the presence of two transcription start sites. In vitro transfection study of the alpha1B subunit-luciferase fusion gene showed that the 4.0-kb 5'-flanking region of the alpha1B gene functions as an efficient promoter in neuronal cells but not in glioma or nonneuronal cells, consistent with the patterns of the endogenous alpha1B gene expression in these cells. Deletion analysis of alpha1B subunit-luciferase fusion gene constructs further revealed the presence of several cis-acting regulatory elements, including a potential repressor located in the distal upstream region (-3992 to -1788) that may be important for the neuron-specific expression of the N-type Ca2+ channel alpha1B subunit gene. ;cysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function

8196634;A human Alu RNA-binding protein whose expression is associated with accumulation of small cytoplasmic Alu RNA.;Human Alu sequences are short interspersed DNA elements which have been greatly amplified by retrotransposition. Although initially derived from the 7SL RNA component of signal recognition particle (SRP), the Alu sequence has evolved into a dominant transposon while retaining a specific secondary structure found in 7SL RNA. We previously characterized a set of Alu sequences which are expressed as small cytoplasmic RNAs and isolated a protein that binds to these transcripts. Here we report that biochemical purification of this protein revealed it as the human homolog of the SRP 14 polypeptide which binds the Alu-homologous region of 7SL RNA. The human cDNA predicts an alanine-rich C-terminal tail translated from a trinucleotide repeat not found in the rodent homolog, which accounts for why the human protein-RNA complex migrates more slowly than its rodent counterpart in RNA mobility shift assays. The human Alu RNA-binding protein (RBP) is expressed after transfection of this cDNA into mouse cells. Expression of human RBP in rodent x human somatic cell hybrids is associated with substantial increase in endogenous small cytoplasmic Alu and scB1 transcripts but not other small RNAs. These studies provide evidence that this RBP associates with Alu transcripts in vivo and affects their metabolism and suggests a role for Alu transcripts in translation in an SRP-like manner. Analysis of hybrid lines indicated that the Alu RBP gene maps to human chromosome 15q22, which was confirmed by Southern blotting. The possibility that the primate-specific structure of this protein may have contributed to Alu evolution is considered. ;alanine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

30714905;Retinal direction selectivity in the absence of asymmetric starburst amacrine cell responses.;In the mammalian retina, direction-selectivity is thought to originate in the dendrites of GABAergic/cholinergic starburst amacrine cells, where it is first observed. However, here we demonstrate that direction selectivity in downstream ganglion cells remains remarkably unaffected when starburst dendrites are rendered non-directional, using a novel strategy combining a conditional GABAA α2 receptor knockout mouse with optogenetics. We show that temporal asymmetries between excitation/inhibition, arising from the differential connectivity patterns of starburst cholinergic and GABAergic synapses to ganglion cells, form the basis for a parallel mechanism generating direction selectivity. We further demonstrate that these distinct mechanisms work in a coordinated way to refine direction selectivity as the stimulus crosses the ganglion cell's receptive field. Thus, precise spatiotemporal patterns of inhibition and excitation that determine directional responses in ganglion cells are shaped by two 'core' mechanisms, both arising from distinct specializations of the starburst network.;-;-;-;hard_0
9528717;Randomized trial of itraconazole oral solution for oropharyngeal candidiasis in HIV/AIDS patients.;"PURPOSE
Oropharyngeal candidasis (thrush) is the most common opportunistic infection in individuals who are positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and those who have progressed to AIDS. Itraconazole has a broad in vitro spectrum of activity, including a wide variety of Candida species. Our study determined the relative efficacy of a new oral solution formulation of itraconazole and fluconazole tablets in the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
This was a prospective randomized, third-party-blind, multicenter trial conducted at 12 centers in the United States. One hundred seventy-nine HIV-positive patients with mycologically documented oropharyngeal candidiasis were treated with itraconazole oral solution 200 mg/ day for 7 or 14 days, or fluconazole tablets 100 mg/day for 14 days. Severity of disease was scored clinically before treatment and at clinical evaluations on days 3, 7, 14, 21, 35, and 42. Semi-quantitative cultures of mouth washings were also obtained on these days.


RESULTS
Both 14-day and 7-day regimens of itraconazole oral solution were equivalent to fluconazole for most efficacy parameters. The clinical response rate was 97% after 14 days of itraconazole and 87% after 14 days of fluconazole. Itraconazole oral solution given for 7 days was also equivalent to fluconazole treatment for 14 days. Approximately one half of patients in all three groups relapsed by 1 month after completion of treatment. There were few adverse reactions to either drug.


CONCLUSION
Itraconazole oral solution is well tolerated and offers an alternative at least as effective as fluconazole in the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis.";-;-;-;hard_0
34750787;An Update on the Critical Role of α-Synuclein in Parkinson's Disease and Other Synucleinopathies: from Tissue to Cellular and Molecular Levels.;The aggregation of alpha-synuclein (α-Syn) plays a critical role in the development of Parkinson's disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies. α-Syn, which is encoded by the SNCA gene, is a lysine-rich soluble amphipathic protein normally expressed in neurons. Located in the cytosolic domain, this protein has the ability to remodel itself in plasma membranes, where it assumes an alpha-helix conformation. However, the protein can also adopt another conformation rich in cross-beta sheets, undergoing mutations and post-translational modifications, then leading the protein to an unusual aggregation in the form of Lewy bodies (LB), which are cytoplasmic inclusions constituted predominantly by α-Syn. Pathogenic mechanisms affecting the structural and functional stability of α-Syn - such as endoplasmic reticulum stress, Golgi complex fragmentation, disfunctional protein degradation systems, aberrant interactions with mitochondrial membranes and nuclear DNA, altered cytoskeleton dynamics, disrupted neuronal plasmatic membrane, dysfunctional vesicular transport, and formation of extracellular toxic aggregates - contribute all to the pathogenic progression of PD and synucleinopathies. In this review, we describe the collective knowledge on this topic and provide an update on the critical role of α-Syn aggregates, both at the cellular and molecular levels, in the deregulation of organelles affecting the cellular homeostasis and leading to neuronal cell death in PD and other synucleinopathies.;lysine;helix;-;LCR_with_function
2450626;Two classes of dentin phosphophoryns, from a wide range of species, contain immunologically cross-reactive epitope regions.;An immunological species comparison, using a monospecific rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against rat incisor alpha-phosphophoryn, has been undertaken to assess the similarity in epitope regions among various dentin phosphophoryns (PP) that were prepared from human, monkey, bovine, ovine, and echinoderm teeth. Dentin extracellular matrix proteins were extracted with a standard method using 0.5 M EDTA in the presence of enzyme inhibitors. Final phosphophoryn purification was performed on DEAE ion exchange HPLC. Cross-reactivity of the polyclonal antibody was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) and dot-blot. The results of this investigation demonstrate a cross-reactivity of the rat-alpha-phosphophoryn antibody (anti-RIPP) with at least one phosphophoryn component in each dentin studied, indicating the existence of similar antigenic determinants among these proteins. It would seem that these epitope regions have been strongly conserved since the epitope region is also present in the phosphoprotein of echinoderm teeth. No cross-reactivity was found with phosvitin (a phosphoserine-rich phosphoprotein), rat serum albumin, bovine serum albumin, or collagen type IV. However, a new and distinct second cross-reactive phosphophoryn, not calcium ion-precipitable, was found in the EDTA insoluble fraction from the teeth. These results indicate that dentin phosphophoryns are specific phenotypic markers for odontoblast expression. Because of the species cross-reactivity, the polyclonal anti-RIPP antibody may be a useful probe in studying the distribution of phosphophoryns in other species, such as human teeth.;serine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
32329130;Chromosome dynamics and spindle microtubule establishment in mouse embryos.;Chromosome segregation errors in mammalian embryos are common and jeopardize embryo health. Here, we perform for the first time 4-Dimensional imaging and tracking of chromosomes and centromeres through each preimplantation mitotic cell division in mouse embryos to define the normal dynamics of chromosome segregation. We show that a microtubule (MT)-dependent inward movement of chromosomes occurs at the time of nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD), particularly in the earliest cell divisions, to position chromosomes prior to spindle assembly. Establishment of a rudimentary metaphase plate occurs immediately after NEBD, and is followed by a progressive alignment and biorientation of mitotic chromosomes. Stable end-on kinetochore-MT attachments form rapidly and attachment errors are uncommon. Altogether our data describe a rapid and efficient spindle assembly pathway that apparently minimizes the need for canonical MT attachment error correction in normally dividing embryos.;-;-;-;hard_0
7478606;The evolution of WT1 sequence and expression pattern in the vertebrates.;WT1 is a Wilms' tumour predisposition gene, encoding a protein with four C-terminal Kruppel-type zinc fingers, which is also a major regulator of kidney and gonadal development. To pinpoint key regulatory domains involved in development and evolution of the vertebrate genitourinary system, we have isolated WT1 orthologues from all gnathostome classes. Partial nucleotide sequence from chick, alligator, Xenopus laevis and zebrafish reveals extensive conservation. Both the zinc fingers and the transregulatory domain exhibit a high level of similarity in all the species examined. However, of the two alternatively spliced regions only one, the three amino acid KTS insertion between zinc fingers 3 and 4, is found in species other than mammals. The 17 amino acid insertion at the C-terminal end of the transregulatory domain is present only in mammals. Residues with reported human pathological mutations are also unaltered across species, underlining their structural significance. Studies in chick and alligator reveal that the mammalian intermediate mesoderm expression pattern is conserved in birds and reptiles.

6095814;Ca2+-dependent hydrophobic-interaction chromatography. Isolation of a novel Ca2+-binding protein and protein kinase C from bovine brain.;Several bovine brain proteins have been found to interact with a hydrophobic chromatography resin (phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B) in a Ca2+-dependent manner. These include calmodulin, the Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) and a novel Ca2+-binding protein that has now been purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. This latter protein is acidic (pI 5.1) and, like calmodulin and some other high-affinity Ca2+-binding proteins, exhibits a Ca2+-dependent mobility shift on sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, with an apparent Mr of 22 000 in the absence of Ca2+ and Mr 21 000 in the presence of Ca2+. This novel calciprotein is distinct from known Ca2+-binding proteins on the basis of Mr under denaturing conditions, Cleveland peptide mapping and amino acid composition analysis. It may be a member of the calmodulin superfamily of Ca2+-binding proteins. This calciprotein does not activate two calmodulin-dependent enzymes, namely cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase and myosin light-chain kinase, nor does it have any effect on protein kinase C. It may be a Ca2+-dependent regulatory protein of an as-yet-undefined enzymic activity. The Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase is also readily purified by Ca2+-dependent hydrophobic-interaction chromatography followed by ion-exchange chromatography, during which it is easily separated from calmodulin. A preparation of protein kinase C that lacks contaminating kinase or phosphatase activities is thereby obtained rapidly and simply.

Knowing the prevalence of lymph node involvement associated with the location of the primary tumor is a prerequisite for operating with curative intent in carcinoma of the bile duct.


METHODS
We evaluated 80 patients with carcinoma of the bile duct or cystic duct to investigate the frequency of lymph node involvement, the mode of lymphatic spread, and prognosis, according to the location of the primary tumor.


RESULTS
The frequency of lymphatic spread of carcinomas in the proximal, middle, and distal bile ducts, excluding seven T1 tumors, was 48%, 67%, and 56%, respectively. With regard to the mode of lymphatic spread: (1) a metastatic pathway along the common hepatic artery predominated over that to the retropancreatic area in the proximal duct carcinoma group; (2) in the middle duct carcinoma group, metastatic lymph nodes were distributed widely, involving nodes around the superior mesenteric artery or at the para-aortic area; and (3) in the distal duct carcinoma group, metastatic nodes generally were localized around the head of the pancreas.


CONCLUSIONS
Understanding the mode of the lymphatic spread according to the primary tumor may be helpful for choosing the appropriate surgical approach with curative intent in bile duct carcinoma.";-;-;-;hard_0
27147467;Cold-inducible proteins CIRP and RBM3, a unique couple with activities far beyond the cold.;Cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRP) and RNA-binding motif protein 3 (RBM3) are two evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding proteins that are transcriptionally upregulated in response to low temperature. Featuring an RNA-recognition motif (RRM) and an arginine-glycine-rich (RGG) domain, these proteins display many similarities and specific disparities in the regulation of numerous molecular and cellular events. The resistance to serum withdrawal, endoplasmic reticulum stress, or other harsh conditions conferred by RBM3 has led to its reputation as a survival gene. Once CIRP protein is released from cells, it appears to bolster inflammation, contributing to poor prognosis in septic patients. A variety of human tumor specimens have been analyzed for CIRP and RBM3 expression. Surprisingly, RBM3 expression was primarily found to be positively associated with the survival of chemotherapy-treated patients, while CIRP expression was inversely linked to patient survival. In this comprehensive review, we summarize the evolutionary conservation of CIRP and RBM3 across species as well as their molecular interactions, cellular functions, and roles in diverse physiological and pathological processes, including circadian rhythm, inflammation, neural plasticity, stem cell properties, and cancer development. ;-;nucleic acid binding;-;hard_2
17880108;Protein dynamics and monomer-monomer interactions in AntR activation by electron paramagnetic resonance and double electron-electron resonance.;The Anthracis repressor (AntR) is a Mn(II)-activated DNA binding protein that is involved in the regulation of Mn(II) homeostasis in Bacillus anthracis. AntR is structurally and functionally homologous to Mn(II)-activated repressor from Bacillus subtillis (MntR). Our studies on AntR focus on metal-regulated activation of the protein. Line shape analysis of continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra showed that metal binding resulted in a general reduction of backbone dynamics and that there were no further changes in backbone motion upon DNA binding. Double electron-electron resonance (DEER) pulsed EPR spectroscopy was used to measure distances between nitroxide spin labels strategically placed in dimeric AntR. The DEER data were analyzed assuming Gaussian distributions for discrete populations of spins. A structural model for AntR was built from homology to MntR, and the experimentally measured distances were simulated to distinguish between spin label and backbone motions. Together with the computational analysis, the DEER results for apo-AntR indicated relatively narrow conformational distributions for backbone residues at the dimer interface and near the metal binding site. No significant changes were observed on these sites in the presence of metal or DNA. On the other hand, the distribution of the conformers and the distances between the putative DNA binding helices decreased upon metal binding. These results suggest that the DNA binding region of AntR shows large amplitude backbone motions in the absence of metal, which may preclude sequence-specific binding to promoter sites. Metal binding narrows the range of conformations accessible in this region and shortens the mean distance between the DNA binding helices, probably resulting in alignment that optimizes promoter recognition and binding.;-;nucleic acid binding;-;hard_2
2716504;A quantitative study of relaxation rate enhancement produced by iron oxide particles in polyacrylamide gels and tissue.;The proton relaxation rate enhancements produced by two types of iron oxide particles, M4125 and AM125 (Advanced Magnetics, Cambridge, MA) designed as potential MR contrast agents, have been measured in polyacrylamide gels and in liver and spleen. The organ uptakes, time courses, and biodistributions of these materials have been measured using radiolabeling. The relaxation rate enhancements produced by these particles have been related to the concentration of iron per gram material at different magnetic field strengths. The relaxation rates increase linearly as a function of concentration at field strengths varying from 0.15 to 7 T. The relaxation effects of these particles in tissue are significantly different from the behavior in vitro. These results suggest that several different mechanisms contribute to relaxation effects in the presence of iron oxide particles and they depend strongly on the way the particles are sequestered. Diffusion effects for a specified TE may be enhanced using gradient or single-spin echoes rather than multiple echoes. AM125 is significantly more effective as a relaxation agent than paramagnetic metal ions only at relatively high fields, while M4125 is less effective per unit concentration.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
2888730;Recognition of the galactose- or N-acetylgalactosamine-binding lectin of Entamoeba histolytica by human immune sera.;Cure of amebic liver abscess is associated with resistance to recurrent invasive amebiasis and the development of a humoral and cell-mediated immune response. We determined whether human immune sera contain blocking antibody for the 170-kilodalton (kDa) galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine (Gal/GalNAc)-binding lectin of Entamoeba histolytica. By Western blot (immunoblot) of whole amebae subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, all eight immune sera studied here prominently recognized a 170-kDa amebic protein. Western blot of the purified Gal/GalNAc lectin with pooled human immune sera (PHIS) confirmed that the 170-kDa band was the adherence lectin. Immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-metabolically-labeled amebae with the antilectin monoclonal antibody H8-5 and with PHIS demonstrated that the 170-kDa lectin was the major antigen recognized by PHIS. The in vitro adherence of E. histolytica trophozoites to CHO cells at 4 degrees C was inhibited by prior exposure of amebae to greater than or equal to 1.0% PHIS. The humoral response to the Gal/GalNAc-binding lectin of the parasite may contribute to the development of protective immunity against invasive amebiasis.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
6119119;[Two forms of glutamine synthetase from pumpkin leaves].;Two molecular forms of glutamine synthetase localized in the cytoplasm and in chloroplasts, respectively, were detected in pumpkin leaves. Ammonium infiltrated into intact pumpkin leaves activated the synthesis of both enzyme forms. Glutamine synthetase from chloroplasts and the cytoplasmic enzyme were purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate fractionation, ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose DE-32, selective adsorption on potassium phosphate gel and preparative electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel. The molecular weights of both forms of glutamine synthetase as determined by gel-filtration through Sephacryl S-200 are equal to 370,000 and 480,000, respectively. During SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the enzymes from both sources produced polypeptide chains with respective molecular weights of 50,000 and 58,000. The amino acid composition of the enzymes differed considerably. The content of alpha-helix moities in the chloroplast and cytoplasmic enzyme made up to 17% and 34%, respectively. In the presence of Mg+ the pH optima for the enzymes were equal to 7.75 and 7.25, respectively, and the Km values for L-glutamate were 46 and 13 mM, respectively. It may be concluded that the enzyme forms under study are isoenzymes.;-;helix;polyacrylamide;hard_3
3258423;Induction of a systemic lupus erythematosus-like disease in mice by a common human anti-DNA idiotype.;Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is considered to be the quintessential autoimmune disease. It has not been possible to induce SLE in animal models by DNA immunization or by challenge with anti-DNA antibodies. We herewith report a murine model of SLE-like disease induced by immunization of C3H.SW female mice with a common human monoclonal anti-DNA idiotype (16/6 idiotype). Following a booster injection with the 16/6 idiotype, high levels of murine anti-16/6 and anti-anti-16/6 antibodies (associated with anti-DNA activity) were detected in the sera of the immunized mice. Elevated titers of autoantibodies reacting with DNA, poly(I), poly(dT), ribonucleoprotein, autoantigens [Sm, SS-A (Ro), and SS-B (La)], and cardiolipin were noted. The serological findings were associated with increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, leukopenia, proteinuria, immune complex deposition in the glomerular mesangium, and sclerosis of the glomeruli. The immune complexes in the kidneys were shown to contain the 16/6 idiotype. This experimental SLE-like model may be used to elucidate the mechanisms underlying SLE.;isoleucine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function

8849881;The yeast HRS1 gene encodes a polyglutamine-rich nuclear protein required for spontaneous and hpr1-induced deletions between direct repeats.;The hrs1-1 mutation was isolated as an extragenic suppressor of the hyperrecombination phenotype of hpr1 delta cells. We have cloned, sequenced and deleted from the genome the HRS1 gene. The DNA sequence of the HRS1 gene reveals that it is identical to PGD1, a gene with no reported function, and that the Hrs1p protein contains polyglutamine stretches typically found in transcription factors. We have purified a His(6) tagged version of Hrs1p protein from E. coli and have obtained specific anti-Hrs1p polyclonal antibodies. We show that Hrs1p is a 49-kD nuclear protein, as determined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blot analysis. The hrs1 delta null mutation reduces the frequency of deletions in wild-type and hpr1 delta backgrounds sevenfold below wild-type and rad52 levels. Furthermore, hrs1 delta cells show reduced induction of the GAL1,10 promoter relative to wild-type cells. Our results suggest that Hrs1p is required for the formation of deletions between direct repeats and that it may function in gene expression. This suggests a connection between gene expression and direct repeat recombination. In this context, we discuss the possible roles of Hrs1p and Hpr1p in initiation of direct-repeat recombination. ;glutamine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
1736963;Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of ribosomal protein AT-L30 from an actinomycete genus, Streptosporangium.;We analyzed the ribosomal AT-L30 proteins from 11 type strains of species belonging to the genus Streptosporangium. The electrophoretic mobilities of the AT-L30 preparations from these strains, as determined by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, revealed that they could be divided into three groups. The first group contained Streptosporangium viridogriseum, S. viridogriseum subsp. kofuense, and S. albidum, while the second group contained S. roseum, S. album, S. vulgare, S. nondiastaticum, S. fragile, S. violaceochromogenes, and S. amethystogenes. S. corrugatum was a member of the third group. These groups were completely consistent with Nonomura's previous classification, which was based on morphological criteria. The results of partial amino acid sequencing of AT-L30 preparations from several representative strains strongly supported the hypothesis that each of the three groups of the genus Streptosporangium merits separate generic status.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
2914847;Identification by sequence analysis of two-site posttranslational processing of the cysteine-rich outer membrane protein 2 of Chlamydia trachomatis serovar L2.;The 60,000-molecular-weight cysteine-rich outer membrane protein (OMP2) from Chlamydia trachomatis participates in the disulfide-mediated outer-membrane organization unique to this organism. In addition, this protein is a primary focus of the host immune response. We cloned and sequenced the gene for OMP2 from C. trachomatis serovar L2. A lambda gt11 recombinant that expressed an antigenic portion of this protein was selected by antibody screening and provided a probe for the selection in lambda 1059 of a clone containing the entire gene. DNA sequencing of this clone identified one open reading frame of 1,641 base pairs, starting with a methionine codon and coding for a polypeptide with a molecular weight of 58,792. Amino-terminal protein sequencing and analysis of the translated DNA sequence demonstrated that processing at alternate signal peptide cleavage sites accounts for the molecular-weight polymorphism of this protein. The mature proteins had a net positive charge and contained 24 cysteine residues. ;cysteine;antigen;-;LCR_with_function
2056057;Application of a polymerase chain reaction for the detection of Mycobacterium leprae in skin tissues.;The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based on the selective amplification of a 530-bp fragment of the gene encoding the proline-rich antigen of Mycobacterium leprae was applied on sections of fixed or frozen biopsy samples from leprosy patients. A simple procedure for the extraction of DNA from M. leprae in clinical specimens that provided suitable template DNA for amplification was developed. When PCR was applied on frozen sections, positive amplification in samples from all untreated acid-fast bacillus (AFB)-positive patients and in samples from 56% of the untreated AFB-negative patients could be detected, while biopsy samples from patients with skin diseases other than leprosy were all PCR negative. With neutral Formalin-fixed biopsy samples, positive amplification in 92% of the samples from untreated AFB-positive patients and in 61% of the samples from untreated AFB-negative patients could be detected by PCR. Biopsy samples exposed to mercuric chloride or nonbuffered formaldehyde containing fixatives were not suitable for application of PCR.

All the antibodies work in immune precipitations as well as in immunoblotting, though with different efficiencies. We have developed a simple epitope mapping technique, which uses partial chemical cleavages at methionine or tryptophan residues followed by immunoblotting from SDS-polyacrylamide gels, to localize the epitopes of nine of these antibodies. The epitopes fall into at least four classes. The mapping procedure should also be useful for other antigens of known primary structure.;-;antigen;polyacrylamide;hard_3
9575251;Scintigraphic detection of infection and inflammation: new developments with special emphasis on receptor interaction.;Various conventional radiopharmaceuticals are currently available for scintigraphic imaging of infection and inflammation. Although a wide variety of infectious and inflammatory foci can be detected with these agents, several disadvantages limit their application. These limitations have stimulated the search for new radiopharmaceuticals. In the past decade a new class of radiopharmaceuticals has emerged: radiolabelled receptor-specific small proteins and peptides. These proteins and peptides are naturally occurring inflammatory mediators which specifically bind to receptors abundantly present in the area of inflammation. In addition, owing to their small size, they rapidly clear from all non-target tissues. This paper provides an overview of these newly developed agents, focussing on imaging characteristics and in vivo uptake mechanisms.;-;-;-;hard_0
33239982;Considerations on the use of MitraClip in the treatment of mitral regurgitation.;Mitral regurgitation (MR) is, by occurrence, the second most common valvular heart disease in the Western world, with a significant impact on prognosis and mortality. A significant number of patients with significant mitral incompetence cannot be submitted to conventional surgery due to high surgical risk. The need for an adequate therapeutical strategy prompted the development of innovative endovascular techniques. Among them, the MitraClip percutaneous system, mimicking the 'edge-to-edge' surgical technique introduced by Alfieri in 2003 has emerged as the treatment of choice in patients not suitable for conventional surgery. Since its introduction, this procedure has been effectively carried out in more than 35 000 patients. The evidences from the first randomized clinical trial, EVEREST II, suggested that the MitraClip system is effective in improving survival and quality of life in patients with severe MR. Further randomized trials, MITRA-FR and COAPT, added some more information, showing that an appropriate patient selection, close attention to the specific anatomical characteristics of the mitral valve, and adequate experience of the centre providing the treatment, are important determinants of the outcome of the procedure.;-;-;-;hard_0
11115612;Stimulatory effect of zinc and growth factor on bone protein component in newborn rats: enhancement with zinc and insulin-like growth factor-I.;"The effect of zinc and growth factor on bone protein component in newborn rats was investigated. The characterization of protein component in the femoral-diaphyseal and metaphyseal tissue of newborn rats (3-35 days old) was examined using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. The diaphyseal and metaphyseal tissues of 7 days-old rats were cultured for 24 or 48 h in a medium containing either vehicle, zinc sulfate (10-4 M) or dipicolinate (10-3 M), a chelator of zinc ion, in the presence or absence of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I; 10-8 M) or transforming growth factor-beta (TFG-beta; 10-10 M) with an effective concentration. Many cellular protein molecules were present in the diaphyseal and metaphyseal tissues; potent bands were seen in protein molecules with about 66 and 46 kDa. Protein molecule of about 66 kDa was greatly released in the medium cultured with the diaphyseal and metaphyseal tissues. This protein in the medium was increased by culture with zinc, IGF-I or TGF-beta. Total protein content in the medium cultured with the diaphyseal and metaphyseal tissues was significantly increased in the presence of zinc, IGF-I or TGF-beta. The IGF-I-increased medium protein content was significantly enhanced by zinc. This enhancing effect was not seen in TGF-beta. Alkaline phosphatase activity and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) content in the diaphyseal and metaphyseal tissues was significantly increased by culture with zinc, IGF-I or TGF-beta. The effect of IGF-I was significantly enhanced by zinc, while it was not found in TGF-beta. The effect of IGF-I or TGF-beta in increasing the bone components was seen in the presence of dipicolinate. This study demonstrates that zinc, like IGF-I and TGF-beta, can increase protein components in the femoral-diaphyseal and metaphyseal tissues of new-born rats. Zinc may especially play a role in bone growth in collaboration with IGF-I.";-;phosphatase activity;polyacrylamide;hard_3
3302169;Three recent cases of the total artificial heart before transplantation.;Three recent cases from one institution using the total artificial heart (TAH) before transplantation are reviewed. The first patient was implanted for 12 hours with the pneumatic Phoenix total artificial heart after failure of a donor heart 1 day after transplant. Following retransplantation the patient died from severe pulmonary edema, pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular failure, and Pseudomonas septicemia. The second patient was implanted with the Jarvik-7 total artificial heart for rapidly deteriorating idiopathic cardiomyopathy. Major complications during the 9 1/2-day implant consisted of severe pulmonary edema for the first 4 days and a multifocal cerebral embolic event on the seventh day after implantation from which he fully recovered. Major problems after transplant included disseminated toxoplasmosis and two mild episodes of rejection. The patient was discharged 68 days after surgery and remains well. The third patient was a 40-year-old woman with rapidly progressing acute influenza A viral myocarditis. Despite immunosuppressive and antiviral therapy, cardiogenic shock with multiple organ failure developed. The 70 ml Jarvik-7 was implanted for 4 1/2 days. Acute humoral rejection from autoantibodies and alloantibodies led to a cardiac arrest on the second day after transplantation. A second 70 ml Jarvik-7 implant was followed by severe multisystem and infectious complications. After prolonged intensive care support, the patient recovered and is now awaiting transplantation. Nearly 100% cytotoxic antibody reactivity caused by multiple antigenic stimuli is preventing ready access to donor hearts for this patient. We view the current role of the total artificial heart as a tool to preserve life until a suitable donor heart can be found, reverse the end-organ effects of progressive heart failure and low output, and restore transplant candidacy in selected patients with temporary reversible contraindications to transplantation.;-;antigen;-;hard_2
2247064;The trypanosome leucine repeat gene in the variant surface glycoprotein expression site encodes a putative metal-binding domain and a region resembling protein-binding domains of yeast, Drosophila, and mammalian proteins.;We have identified a new variant surface glycoprotein expression site-associated gene (ESAG) in Trypanosoma brucei, the trypanosome leucine repeat (T-LR) gene. Like most other ESAGs, it is expressed in a life cycle stage-specific manner. The N-terminal 20% of the predicted T-LR protein resembles the metal-binding domains of nucleic acid-binding proteins. The remainder is composed of leucine-rich repeats that are characteristic of protein-binding domains found in a variety of other eucaryote proteins. This is the first report of leucine-rich repeats and potential nucleic acid-binding domains on the same protein. The T-LR gene is adjacent to ESAG 4, which has homology to the catalytic domain of adenylate cyclase. This is intriguing, since yeast adenylate cyclase has a leucine-rich repeat regulatory domain.

20159564;Identification of a heat shock-responsive cis-acting DNA sequence and its transcriptional regulator: Their roles in the expression of the Spirulina-desD gene in response to heat stress.;This study addresses the importance of a heat-shock-responsive cis-acting DNA element and its transcriptional regulator, which play key roles in the regulation of the Spirulina-desD gene on exposure to high temperatures. Temperature response analysis studies showed that the AT-rich region that is located between nt -98 to -80 of the Spirulina-desD gene promoter serves as a binding site for its transcriptional regulator. LC-MS/MS analysis of the DNA-binding protein complex revealed that the amino acid sequences of the bound proteins were homologous to those of several proteins, including a DNA-binding protein, heat shock protein-90 (Hsp90 or HtpG), GroEL and various protein kinases. In addition, western blot analysis indicated that the chaperones GroEL and Hsp90 and a dephosphorylation reaction played a role in the response to elevated temperatures. We conclude that the regulatory DNA segments and the corresponding regulatory binding proteins are distinct for each particular stress condition. This is true, irrespective of whether the regulatory mechanisms that govern the expression of the cold- and heat-regulated desD gene depend on similar phosphorylation- and dephosphorylation-dependent conformational changes that modulate the association of the co-chaperone. ;threonine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

CDODA-Me (15 mg/kg/d) was a potent inhibitor of tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model (PC3 cells) and also decreased expression of Sp transcription factors in tumors. CDODA-Me-mediated downregulation of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 was due to induction of the transcriptional repressor ZBTB4, which competitively binds and displaces Sp transcription factors from GC-rich sites in Sp1-, Sp3-, Sp4-, and Sp-regulated gene promoters. ZBTB4 levels are relatively low in DU145 and PC3 cells due to suppression by miR paralogs that are members of the miR-17-92 (miR-20a/17-5p) and miR-106b-25 (miR-106b/93) clusters. Examination of publically available prostate cancer patient array data showed an inverse relationship between ZBTB4 and miRs-20a/17-5p/106b/93 expression, and increased ZBTB4 in patients with prostate cancer was a prognostic factor for increased survival. CDODA-Me induces ZBTB4 in prostate cancer cells through disruption of miR-ZBTB4 interactions, and this results in downregulation of pro-oncogenic Sp transcription factors and Sp-regulated genes. ;cysteine;transcription factor;-;LCR_with_function
2049067;Primary structure of the human laminin A chain. Limited expression in human tissues.;cDNA clones for the human laminin A chain were isolated from libraries prepared from human gestational choriocarcinoma cell line (JAR) RNA. They cover approx. 8 kb from the 5'-end of the 9.5 kb mRNA coding for this protein. Our clones contain 94 nucleotide residues for the 5'-end untranslated region and 7885 nucleotide residues of coding sequence. The complete human laminin A chain contains a 17-amino acid-residue signal peptide and a 3058-residue A chain proper. The human laminin A chain has a distinct domain structure with numerous internal cysteine-rich repeats. The large globular domain G has five repeats, which have several conserved glycine and cysteine residues. Furthermore the A chain contains 20 internal cysteine-rich repeats present in tandem arrays in three separate clusters (domains IIIa, IIIb and V). Domain I + II has a predicted continuous alpha-helical structure characterized by heptad repeats and three domains (IVa, IVb and VI) are predicted to contain a number of beta-sheets and coiled-coil structures. Northern-blot analysis was used to study the laminin A chain expression in the JAR cell line, full-term placenta and newborn-human tissues (kidney, spleen, lung, heart muscle, psoas muscle and diaphragm muscle). The expression was detectable in newborn-human kidney and JAR cell line only. The overall amino acid sequence identity between human and mouse is 76%. The human chain has only one Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence, which is located in the long arm within domain G, whereas the single RGD sequence in the mouse chain is located in the short arm in domain IIIb.

34103467;Stress granules, RNA-binding proteins and polyglutamine diseases: too much aggregation?;Stress granules (SGs) are membraneless cell compartments formed in response to different stress stimuli, wherein translation factors, mRNAs, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and other proteins coalesce together. SGs assembly is crucial for cell survival, since SGs are implicated in the regulation of translation, mRNA storage and stabilization and cell signalling, during stress. One defining feature of SGs is their dynamism, as they are quickly assembled upon stress and then rapidly dispersed after the stress source is no longer present. Recently, SGs dynamics, their components and their functions have begun to be studied in the context of human diseases. Interestingly, the regulated protein self-assembly that mediates SG formation contrasts with the pathological protein aggregation that is a feature of several neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, aberrant protein coalescence is a key feature of polyglutamine (PolyQ) diseases, a group of nine disorders that are caused by an abnormal expansion of PolyQ tract-bearing proteins, which increases the propensity of those proteins to aggregate. Available data concerning the abnormal properties of the mutant PolyQ disease-causing proteins and their involvement in stress response dysregulation strongly suggests an important role for SGs in the pathogenesis of PolyQ disorders. This review aims at discussing the evidence supporting the existence of a link between SGs functionality and PolyQ disorders, by focusing on the biology of SGs and on the way it can be altered in a PolyQ disease context.;glutamine;nucleic acid binding;-;LCR_with_function

The skin temperature of the bilateral second fingers during ice water immersion were measured in 17 patients with JMA and 25 normal controls. The insufficient fall of the skin temperature during ice water immersion was observed in 5 patients (3 patients in atrophic side, 2 patients in non-atrophic side). The insufficient recovery of the skin temperature was observed in 6 patients (3 patients in atrophic side, 3 patients in non-atrophic side). The both of the insufficient fall and recovery of the skin temperature was observed in one patient (both sides). The insufficient fall of the skin temperature indicates the hypofunction of skin vasomotor activity, and the insufficient recovery of the skin temperature indicates the hyperfunction of skin vasomotor activity because JMA has no disturbance of the peripheral sensory nerve fibers. We conclude that the responsible lesion of these abnormalities may be in the descending sympathetic tract in the cervical spinal cord.;-;-;-;hard_0

Units with different types of adaptation are found in the same muscle; their afferents belong mainly to group I, although there is a zone of overlapping with group II afferents. These differences are manifested at high values of initial stretching of the muscle.

Rat kidney cytosol was fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, and the proteins were separated by ion-exchange column chromatography, gel-filtration column chromatography, and hydrophobic interaction column chromatography. Acylase activity with NAC and N-acetyl-L-methionine (NAM), a known substrate for acylase I, as substrates coeluted during all chromatographic steps. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the protein was purified to near homogeneity and had a subunit Mr of 43 000, which is identical with the Mr of acylase I from porcine kidney and bovine liver. n-Butylmalonic acid was a slow-binding inhibitor of acylase I and inhibited the deacetylation of NAC with a Ki of 192 +/- 27 microM. These results show that acylase I catalyzes the deacetylation of NAC. The acylase I-catalyzed deacetylation of a range of S-alkyl-N-acetyl-L-cysteines, their carbon and oxygen analogues, and the selenium analogue of NAM was also studied with porcine kidney acylase I. The specific activity of the acylase I-catalyzed deacetylation of these substrates was related to their calculated molar volumes and log P values. The S-alkyl-N-acetyl-L-cysteines with short (C0-C3) and unbranched S-alkyl substituents were good acylase I substrates, whereas the S-alkyl-N-acetyl-L-cysteines with long (>C3) and branched S-alkyl substituents were poLr acylase I substrates. The carbon and oxygen analogues of S-methyl-N-acetyl-L-cysteine and the carbon analogue of S-ethyl-N-acetyl-L-cysteine were poor acylase I substrates, whereas the selenium analogue of NAM was a good acylase I substrate.;-;-;polyacrylamide;hard_1
9405765;Epidemiology of common neurosurgical diseases in the neonate.;This article reviews the epidemiology and risk factors of posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus and neural tube defects (NTDs). Posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus is discussed in terms of risk factors for intraventricular hemorrhage. Four categories of risk factors are presented: maturational factors, antepartum factors, peripartum factors, and factors conferred by postnatal conditions. The complex epidemiology of neural tube defects is discussed in terms of person, place, and time. Interventional strategies, including antenatal screening and nutritional supplementation for NTD prevention, are reviewed.;-;-;-;hard_0
